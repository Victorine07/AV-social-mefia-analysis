Purpose \\n\\nThe purpose of these national enforcement guidelines is to:  \\n1. provide guidance about how the requirement of \\n proper control \\nin Australian Road \\nRule 297 should apply to vehicles with automated functions  \\n2. confirm that the human driver is responsible for compl ying with road traffic laws \\nwhen a vehicle has conditional automatio n engaged at a point in time.  \\n\\nAustralia’s road traffic laws are based on the principle tha\\n t the driver is in control of the \\nvehicle. In the road rules, \\ndrive\\n \\nis defined to include ‘be in control of’. T\\n he road rules have \\na performance-based requirement that a driver exercises \\n proper control \\nof the vehicle. \\nRoad Rule 297(1) states: \\nA driver must not drive a vehicle unless the driver has proper control.  \\nThese concepts of \\ncontrol\\n and \\nproper control \\nare challenged by emerging technologies \\nthat are doing more of the driving, with humans monitoring the vehicle and  acting as the \\nfallback.  \\nGuidelines are therefore needed to  clarify the application of the  current law to vehicles  \\nwith automated functions . \\n\\n2. Objectives \\n\\nThese national enforcement guidelines have been developed  to: \\n\\n\\uf0b7\\n support road safety outcomes   \\n\\n\\uf0b7\\n be consistently adopted by all states and territor ies  \\n\\n\\uf0b7\\n be technology-neutral  \\n\\n\\uf0b7\\n provide police with clear guidance about how Road Rule 297 and the requirement \\nof \\nproper control \\nshould apply to vehicles with automated functions  \\n\\n\\uf0b7\\n confirm that the human driver is responsible for compl ying with road traffic laws \\nwhen a vehicle has conditional automation engaged at a point in time   \\n\\n\\uf0b7\\n be updated and kept relevant  to ensure they reflect judicial interpretations of \\ncontrol, changes in legislation and developing technology   \\n\\n\\uf0b7\\n have regard to all leve ls of driving automation in the longer term   \\n\\n\\uf0b7\\n assist road transport agencies when considering the consequences of granting \\nexemptions from traffic laws   \\n\\n\\uf0b7\\n not affect current rules for drivers of non -automated vehicles.   \\n\\n3. Scope \\n\\nThese guidelines have been drafte d for immediate use and are not reliant on any \\nlegislative amendments. The guidelines provide police with guidance only and do not \\nfetter police discretion to determine \\n proper control\\n based on the particular circumstances \\nof each case.  \\n\\n3.1 Matters in scope \\n\\nThese guidelines are limited to current road traffic laws  only. ', ' \\n\\n  National enforcement guidelines for automated November 2017\\n 2 \\nIn relation to \\nproper control \\nin Road Rule 297, these guidelines provide examples of \\nbehaviours that indicate \\n proper control\\n for the following:  \\n\\n\\uf0b7\\n vehicles that do not have any level of  automation engaged at a point in time \\n\\n\\uf0b7\\n vehicles with driver assistance (Level 1)\\n1 and partial automation (Level 2) where \\nthe human driver performs part of the dynamic driving task  \\n\\n\\uf0b7\\n vehicles with conditional automation (Level 3)  where the human driver must be  \\nready to respond to vehicle system failures and requests to take over the driving \\ntask.  \\n\\n3.2 Matters out of scope \\n\\nThe guidelines \\ndo not\\n extend to civil liability or  criminal responsibility for a crash or road \\ntrauma. \\nThese guidelines \\ndo not\\n currently provide examples of behaviours that indicate \\n proper \\ncontrol\\n for the following:  \\n\\n\\uf0b7\\n \\nVehicles operating at high automation (L evel 4) because these vehicles are not \\nanticipated to be commercially released on the market until 2020 and v ehicles \\noperating at full automatio n (Level 5) because these vehicles are not anticipated to \\nbe commercially released on the market for the foreseeable future.\\n  \\n\\nGuidelines for vehicles at these levels of automation will be considered when \\nchanges to road traffic laws recognise that the drive r of a vehicle could be an \\nautomated driving system , with an entity responsible for the actions of the \\nautomated driving system . These reforms are not likely to be fully implemented in \\nAustralia until around 2020.\\n  \\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7\\n \\nVehicles and automated features that cannot operate on public roads without  a \\npermit or exemption(s) from the road traffic laws such as low-speed driverless \\npassenger shuttles and remote parking assistance features.  \\n \\n\\nAt the time of publication of these guidelines,  remote parking assistance  features \\nare not being introduced into the Australian market because they cannot operate \\nwithout an exemption. By way of example,  Road Rule 213 (which is an offence \\nprovision) requires the driver to apply the parking brake effectively before leaving \\nthe vehicle. Road Rule 213 cannot be complied with when the remote parking \\nassistance feature is engaged.  As such, remote parking assistance feat ures \\ncannot currently legally operate on public roads  in Australia.  \\n \\n\\nIf a permit or exemption(s) from the  road rules is given, police will have regard to \\nthe requirements in the permit or exemption notice.  The requirements outlined in \\nan exemption or permit notice could be guided by the national enforcement \\nguidelines and could include some of the indicators provided in the guidelines.   \\n  \\n                                                      \\n\\n1\\n These national enforcement guidelines adopt  the levels of driving automation in SAE International Standard \\nJ3016, \\nTaxonomy and Definitions of Terms Relates to  Driving Automation Systems for On -Road Motor \\nVehicles\\n.

Levels of driving automation  \\n\\nA number of vehicles on our roads  are equipped with driver assistance, partial automation \\nand parking assistance.  The number of vehicles with automated functions (and the range \\nof automated functions) will likely increase.   \\nManufacturers use different terminology when referring to  the automation capability of \\ntheir vehicles.

law\\n.\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nThese guidelines should be read in conjunction with the following principles\\n : \\n1. Where a vehicle is capable of more than one level of automation, the relevant indicators are those that apply to the level of  automation engaged. \\n2. Drivers must comply with road traffic laws unless they have an exemption, including prohibitions on use of visual display units and mobile phones.  \\n3. \\nDrivers should comply with the manufacturer’s requirements for the operation of the vehicle, unless they conflict with a rele\\n vant road traffic laws.  \\n4. \\nDrivers should adapt their behaviour based on the degree to which their vehicle’s automated functions are being used at any g\\n iven moment according to the designed and \\ngiven capabilities and limitations of the system.   \\n5. Drivers should adapt their behaviour depending on the road conditions.    \\n   ', 'National enforcement guidelines for automated vehicles November 2017 \\n 7\\n \\n6. Enforcement agency interaction with automated vehicles  \\n\\nUnder current laws it is not possible to mandate physical signals on vehicle s with \\nautomated functions to indicate whether an automated application is engaged at a \\nparticular time. Given current practice and indications from international developments, it \\nis unlikely that manufacturers will provide such identification. There is also currently no \\nrequirement for the driver or manufacturer to provide access to information about whether \\nor not an automated function is engaged, although it may be obtained via subpoena or \\nsummons. \\nVehicle registration data, including information on the National Exchange of Vehic le Data \\nand Information Service, is likely to include  fields relating to the level of driving \\nautomation, or relevant automated functions (such as traffic jam assist)  as part of future \\nchanges to registration systems and processes. This work will be progre ssed as part of \\nthe safety assurance system for automated vehicles project and is scheduled to be \\nimplemented by 2020. \\nAs such, a vehicle’s registration data could provide \\n an avenue for \\n\\nobtaining information about a vehicle’s automated functionality. \\n  \\n\\n6.1 How a human driver could demonstrate  vehicle automation was \\nengaged and the level of automation engaged   \\n\\nIn determining whether there has been a breach of Road Rule 297, police officers must \\nsatisfy themselves that a driver of a vehicle did not have \\n proper control\\n. This may be \\nbased on observed behaviour. As a defence, the driver of an automated vehicle could \\nclaim they had \\nproper control\\n because of the automated function engaged at the time of \\nthe observed behaviour and the vehicle was operating in compliance  with the road traffic \\nlaws.   \\nIn this situation there is no onus on police officers to determine whether a vehicle has a \\nlevel of automation engaged at a point  in time. Rather, the onus is on human drivers (or \\nregistered operators for camera -related offences) to provide evidence that a vehicle is \\nautomated and the level of automation  engaged.  \\nA human driver could demonstrate vehicle automation was engaged \\n –\\n and the level of \\nautomation \\n–\\n at a given point in time in the following ways:   \\n\\n\\uf0b7\\n a statement made by the driver \\n\\n\\uf0b7\\n provision \\nof the driver’\\ns manual, which is prepared by the manufacturer and \\n\\ncontains a description of the vehicle’s automated capabilities and how they should \\n\\nbe used safely \\n\\n\\uf0b7\\n provision of information availab le to the driver about the make and  model of the \\nvehicle and its capabilities \\n\\n\\uf0b7\\n allowing visual observation of the in -vehicle dashboard screen that provides \\ninformation about safe driving behaviours . \\nFor example: \\n\\n\\uf0b7\\n An officer observes a driver in a vehicle turned to face the front -seat passenger \\nwithout any hands on the steering wheel.  The vehicle appears to be driving safely. \\nThe officer believes the driver may not have \\n proper control\\n of the vehicle and \\nindicates the driver to pull ov er.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7\\n The driver provides evidence that the vehicle is an  automated vehicle operating \\nwith Level 3 automation , and therefore the observed behaviour is safe . The \\nevidence \\nincludes the driver’s manual and \\n information contained on  the in-vehicle \\ndashboard screen.  ', ' \\n\\n  National enforcement guidelines for automated November 2017\\n 8 \\n\\uf0b7\\n For this reason, the driver explains that he or she does not need to have any \\nhands on the steering wheel or to be directly focused on the road because the \\nvehicle controls the steering, acceleration and all other aspects  of the driving task.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7\\n On the basis of this information, the officer could apply the guideline behaviours  in \\nTable 2 to make an assessment of whether the driver had \\n proper control\\n of the \\nvehicle. \\n\\n\\uf0b7\\n \\nIf a driver disagrees with the officer’s assessment, he or sh\\n e could elect to go to \\ncourt to challenge any infringement notice or charge . In court, the prosecution \\nwould need to show why the driver did not have \\n proper control\\n by outlining the \\nactions of the vehicle and the behaviour of the driver. In defence, the dr iver could \\nargue that he or she did have \\n proper control\\n and his or her behaviour was \\nappropriate for the level of automation that was engaged at the time of the alleged \\noffence.  \\n\\n6.2 Other offences that may apply instead of a  breach of Road Rule 297 \\n\\nLack of \\nproper control\\n may also be indicated by: \\n\\n\\uf0b7\\n on-road behaviour that is addressed by specific traffic offences (such as, for \\nexample, changing lanes without indicating appropriately)  \\n\\n\\uf0b7\\n a collision or crash that may be indicative of more serious offences ( such as, for \\nexample, failing to exercise due care and attention or dangerous/negligent driving ). \\nThese offences will require a case-by-case consideration of the duty of care and \\nthe way the driver discharged that duty. This will allow a full range of driver \\nbehaviours to be considered, including what was reasonable in the circumstances \\nfor the level of automation engaged.  \\nA breach of Road Rule 297 should be considered when on -road observations show : \\n\\n\\uf0b7\\n the driver does not comply with the indicators of \\n proper control\\n outlined in Table 2, \\n\\nand  \\n\\n\\uf0b7\\n no specific traffic offence (or a more serious offence) applies.
