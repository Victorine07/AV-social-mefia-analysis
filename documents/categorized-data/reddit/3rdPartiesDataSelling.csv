0,mpg isnt an extreme example at all you have to realize that only up until the last decade did auto companies start using smaller motors with turbos to increase efficiency and making it the norm before that a lot of cars had v to vs which arent getting mpg i fully understand your premise but it doesnt line up with the facts the best selling vehicles for the big are trucks then suvs just maintaining them does nothing to curb carbon emissions i think electric cars are pretty dumb currently as well i personally would love to have a small seat electric vehicle that was affordable but anything like that is expensive or not an option in the midwest for the winters
1,its very easy to imagine one tire getting into a pothole solving the whole system down making it behave unpredictably where is roundabouts work way better by slowing everyone down but it doesnt involve selling literally everyone a new car so i guess bad solution then
2,as if people arent already killed trying to cross intersections that self driving schema isnt the solution but pretending this doesnt already happen is nuts anyone purporting self driving to be perfect and flawless is selling snake oil the actual goal of self driving is to be better than people are not perfect and that bar is pretty low the most common reason for car accidents is sleepiness affecting response time
3,theres also the fact that electric car companies make money selling emissions credits to other car companies allowing them to legally pollute more than they normally would negating much of their eco friendly appeal
4,well would agree that marketing is likely selling us that but how many people do you know actually claim that electric vehicles will solve all our problems seems like a bit of a straw man if incremental improvements arent going to save us what will how do you get from not saved to saved in a single bound without incremental change
5,well would agree that marketing is likely selling us that but how many people do you know actually claim that electric vehicles will solve all our problems seems like a bit of a straw man every person i know thats not a leftist the only exception being conservatives who dont think theres even a problem i dont see how this is a strawman its the narrative being thrown in our face in the us at least every day if incremental improvements arent going to save us what will how do you get from not saved to saved in a single bound without incremental change did you really throw back your own strawman after accusing me of a strawman clearly theres going to be incremental change it just cant be and all weve done is moved from gas to evs
6,i totally agree i take public transport to work the issue is the methods of legislating the car out of the city centre right now in the uk birmingham council are charging per calendar day to drive within the ring road if i head to a venue on an evening and have to load out equipment and drive home at i am charged the ring road contains all of the music venues and the vast majority of rehearsal spaces several of the rehearsal spaces are already making posts about going out of business because of this i have a diesel car i could sell it for k and buy a version for k and then be able to drive into town for free if there was any genuine alternative to driving or selling my car for something else i would do it i cant afford an electric car and dont have a driveway so couldnt charge at home regardless terraced houses in the uk make this impossible in a lot of poorer areas taxis arent appropriate ive previously run charity events putting on regular gigs in liverpool and birmingham and even with a good relationship with certain taxi companies half of the drivers refuse to load amps or drum kits into their car enforce it on the business not the people its exactly the same way companies are responsible for of emissions but the onus is increasingly put onto the individual
7,lol like a transit policy degree has anything to do with home evalutions and yes his home went down and he considered selling it to move to a suburb near me my house is literally worth x what it was before covid because people want out of the cities
8,the biggest selling point is not even the comfort but avoiding the bureaucracy and harassment of airport security here take my shoes and my belt and eat them motherfuckers
9,i think they have to stop trying to sell selfdriving cars on safety when we switched from horses to cars we did it for convenience despite the massive increase of deaths just stop trying to make it the biggest selling point itll just make people lose confidence every time theres an accident
10,it is looking more and more like car manufacturers will be selling an insurance product for the vehicle they sell the insurance industry is not actually prepared for the changes coming their way
11,this tesla are playing with fire and vastly over selling the safety of what is slightly smarter cruise control and this sort of shit is what happens its all fun and lols until that guys tesla hits a situation it cant handle which can include a badly painted lane marking and wipes out a family in a minivan while matey is asleep at the wheel
12,why does tesla hurt your feelings are you a terrorist selling some oil are ya you wanna go
13,its an exaggerated counter point to your exaggerated point neither will be true and it will land somewhere in the middle lab grown meat will not result in walmart selling a wagyu beef the lab meat will be just good enough to compete with the real thing and stop there because that is where the profit line is same with cars the automated cats will only be just good enough to beat out cureent uber lift and other status quo services once they hit that spot they will stop unless there is some incentive to go farther the likely truth is you will have options economy seater with limited storage and a family option that is similar to a mini van
14,countries that allow the open buying and selling of organs dont have waiting lists just fyi queue the hysterical comments about assassinations to harvest other peoples organs edit queue should be cue
15,or we could legalize selling organs that would work too
16,if demand gets that high they could start selling extreme sport and manually operated vehicle insurance the cost your organs when you die and maybe like admin fee
17,seems to me like the article is more like a very brilliant backward sell job for driverless cars it remains to be seen how many lives will be saved and frankly can someone tell me what corporate industry actually cares about less road fatalities in the first place other than using it as a great selling point
18,its so difficult to get an organ when you need it precisely because selling organs is illegal tons of people in need die and a dark blackmarket is created for those who can afford it
19,you know you could always pay people for their organs i am not an organ donor because of the invisible hand of capitalism in my country us the hospitals need to make money the doctors often have in student loans and when my injured ass is sitting on k heart k in kidneys k liver the hospital will make a lot more money selling my organs than they ever will saving me there has even been a documented case of this where a year old suffered a serious tbi while snow boarding and the hospital was unusually lax about saving him yet they made gs on his organs all im saying is i will never donate my organs so a for profit institution can sell them if a hospital wants to sell my organs i want my next of kin compensated
20,the reason we have an organ shortage is because its illegal to sell organs wed have a food shortage if it were illegal to charge for food too so why would organs be any different if we legalized markets in organs there would be a number of benefits probably lots more people would sell kidneys and thus everyone who needed a kidney could get one health insurance would presumably cover this extra cost so poor people who needed kidneys would still get them people who needed money could get some by selling a kidney families of deceased people could get some extra money by selling the organs of their deceased relatives rather than just donating them or more likely just buryingdestroyingwasting them living people could get extra money for nothing by just agreeing that their organs could be taken after their deaths selling organs is one of those things that sounds icky but when you think about it theres really no good reason to oppose it thats why a pretty large majority http kidneys of economists agree that kidney markets would be a good idea iran has a somewhat legalized kidney market and they have no waitlist for kidneys
21,so long as the manufacturer and not the owner is liable for the damage injury and death that their vehicles cause or fail by inaction to prevent unfortunately i predict a situation where the owners have to pay the insurance for self driving related damage as soon as the lawsuits start rolling in against a particular make or model the price of said insurance will skyrocket leaving the owners with a liability and the manufacturers in the clear busy selling full self drive now with less random swerving into cyclists to a new batch of suckers
22,that is unacceptable just an excuse with this logic might as well start selling unproven medicine in the market it will surely kill some people but over the long haul cures will be discovered
23,tldr scary to use humans to test new tech the world is desensitized to loss of human life similar to companies under the fda autonomous vehicle companies should prove their products are safe and effective before using you might die but thats okay slogan this is terrifying ideology for example a woman killed her newborn in a town elsewhere in my state by shaking it because it wouldnt eat the ct scan showed six blunt force injuries on the brain everyone finds this abhorrent how is abortion not on the same page a human fetus is a human too i digresspeople die in cars and that is a terrible thing to happen someone dies in an autonomous vehicle and thats for the cause someone getting killed is such a desensitized event in the world now that the selling point for future tech egautonomous vehicles is that some people will die during testing and that is okay some people died at sandy hook elementary was that okay in order to improve security at schools no and if you think it was you extremely need to rethink some things about yourself heres the reality of the situation loss of life is never okay every person is unique and wonderful and beautifully made never should there be technology or ideas that we explore where human mortality is not the utmost concern autonomous vehicles shouldnt be sold under the notion that youre an early user so you may die but thats a sacrifice we are willing to make because our product is better at driving than you a la lord farquad youtubehikuxfcsreu its nonsensical death comes for us all thats the consequence of our sin yes we accept that but sacrificing people for technological advancements isnt that illegal not to mention hugely unethical enmwikipediaorgwikiunethical_human_experimentation read the united states section the kefauver harris drug amendment to the federal food drug consumer act requires companies to prove safety and effectiveness of their products theyre prioritizing human life and wellness now as law requires why arent autonomous car companies trying to sell their products with the focal selling point being the best safety and effectiveness too surely this is being investigated surely the autonomous vehicle companies arent experimenting why should we accept a product that isnt proven effective and safe in the highest degree i dont think we should accept it not until its been shown to be safe there are good and bad drivers on the roads every time we get in a car we risk our lives but we take penicillin because we know its been proven effective and safe and labeled as such i drive my particular car because its been proven safe and effective at keeping me that way i buckle my seatbelt for the same reason its proven to be safe and effective why shouldnt an autonomous vehicle be subject to the same parameters im okay with downvotes felt like adding my two pence this is a hot topic rall we need to be discussing this
24,it will happen so rarely that the owners of the fleet of vehicles or the company that makes them will happily pay for all the bills and a nice pay out to the families it will buy them pr an alleviate any fears of people buying these cars and ending up screwed by a in a million accident least if thats not what they do they are fucking idiots simply paying for it will be the smallest expense in operating a fleet or manufacturing and selling these cars to the public it really isnt going to happen much and they are going to be making so much fucking money
25,this will be solved by selling cars as a service not a product you pay a monthly bill and the manufacturer will provide you with the car you cant modify it and they will do the maintenance and even replace the car regularly the manufacturer will be accountable for every accident and killing and they will hire the insurance
26,i like that train of thought but i dont put much stock into that being a thing in my life time multiple owners of one car means there will be times when you cant use it uber style would be more expensive than owning unless you travel very short distances very rarely like leasing a car whether you own a car or partake in a futuristic uber program you essentially pay per mile you drive even when you factor in selling the car eventually changes a little if you dont drive much with uber style the cost per mile is unavoidably higher because you have to pay for someone to clean it the technological infrastructure and wages to make car sharing possible insurancecost splitting in case people vandalize or damage the interior or exterior someone to do simple everyday maintenance like change the wipers and the cost disadvantage of buying a new car if youre someone who usually buys used cars then factor in the fact that the company organizing the scheme and any companies involved with aspects of it would be trying to turn a profit youve got more middlemen between you and the manufacturer if elon musks automation scheme works out and cars end up getting way cheaper in the future the cost disadvantage for uber style ownership might be less of an issue but actual ownership will always be cheaper
27,also do you really want some company tracking and selling data about everywhere you go and everything you do while in their cars because i guarantee you they will
28,you misunderstand first let me clarify my statement i am saying that it would take tesla more than years to create something as confidentreliable as this video with their current hardware and i know they plan on continuing with this hardware as that is their strategy and they have been promising fsd with this current hardware take a company that is pretty good at innovating i agree tesla is great at innovating and an extremely exciting company however for them to create what you see in this video with their hardware and strategy will several times harder than what waymo has done it will require vastly more technology breakthroughs that are not in the foreseeable future if tesla were to drop their current strategy and hardware and start over and create a waymo clone i am sure they could do that in years or so but they do not intent to do that when you have pretty much half a million cars or more collecting driving data worldwide on edge cases sigh you and everyone else have got to drop this man its a useful tool but is really far less relevant and important than you believe waymo has at last publishing in a fleet of vehicles even if they quadrupled that its still less than vehicles out in the wild collecting data irrelevant i dont think its a hardware issue at this time its more getting the software right yes but when you have less hardware redundancies the software doesnt need to be a little better it needs to be x x times better k people that already bought it its going to be a massive change only k its gotta be higher than this tesla is selling k vehicles per quarter years is probably my best case idea for teslas software to be at this level we are seeing i share your excitement and enthusiasm its fun to dream i agree wouldnt that be something if that turned about to be the case but i hope you arent getting in to deep into the fantasy
29,because to do that requires a huge effort to automate roads and car companies cant sell cars which are automated to people with tons of money until the roads are automated for everyone yes its a dumb reason but thats it the money is made selling expensive automated cars to people to drive on existing roads its money its almost always money
30,its not only the technology that needs to be heavily regulated but the marketing and advertising auto manufacturers are making bold claims and selling this technology to normal folks who dont understand just how complex these systems are or how prone to failure they can be people are far too trusting of this tech and its going to get people killed
31,imagine for a moment youre a physics enthusiast imagine theres a physics related subreddit now imagine that theres a bunch of people usually without any education or knowledge of physics who post crazy perpetual motion machines or devices that theyre selling to the public of course that harvest dark matter as green energy or predict the jetsons tier hovercars without any actual science to back how it would work then when you complain about it someone says you hate physics andor elon musk or are just generally outraged whatever the fuck that means thats how ridiculous this all is except its technology which means everyone and their dog has their c to put in and to make ps i like elon musk so that stupid argument is even more bizarre to me
32,its public infrastructure that weve all paid for and share more force at gunpoint all licensure is the government taking rights and selling them back people can refrain from doing certain things until they learn the skills involved it happens in a number of different industries do you really think its okay to haul someone off to jail for driving without a license if theyve never hurt anyone
33,you make good points and this really highlights how far away from actual self driving cars we are elon musk has spent years selling us this idea when all theyve got is cruise control that can follow lanes and even if we had the technology for cars to drive themselves were still years from resolving the ethical issues
34,its hard to see it ending up any other way at least for fully autonomous cars however when they actually start selling these cars to consumers there are likely to be some catches they havent mentioned yet first if you have a car with a full manual mode ie one where the human is in ultimate control and wont be overridden your obviously not going to be covered by the manufacturer when your in that mode during the transition back to computer driving you also wont be covered for some amount of time to make sure that you didnt put the computer in a situation it cant recover from as a result of your manual control the second major limitation is that there will be strict maintenance requirements possibly even a maintenance contract that you pay in advance and the car will go get itself fixed by an authorized manufacturer approved mechanic likely at a dealership when it decides it needs something fixed even if there is no contract failure to get a problem fixed going to an unapproved mechanic or fixing something yourself may all suspend the manufacturers automatic assumption of liability they may still be liable but they will want the chance to investigate and if necessary disclaim liability it the accident was really the fault of poor repair work unapproved modifications will likewise void coverage
35,seems like there would be significant economies of scale to insure a whole fleet of cars at once instead of doing it individually not to mention that buying a preinsured car is one less hassle the owner has to deal with basically what im saying is that manufacturers selling preinsured cars would have a large marketing advantage over those who didnt that would eventually force all manufacturers to insure their own cars
36,selling preinsured cars would have a large marketing advantage over those who didnt in some ways but remember the cost to provide that service will have to be built into the cost of the vehicle its a tougher sell when your vehicle is thousands of dollars more than an equivalent vehicle from another company even if your vehicle ends up coming out cheaper in the long run people arent always good at making smart decisions on things like that
37,tldr google stock is probably still undervalued this isnt a new tech product this is going to be a fundamental piece of the st century transport infrastructure and google is going to own it outright this is like railroads in the s this is a hundred year business even the self driving hype men are underselling this and theyre vastly underestimating how quickly it will happen
38,i thought you were spouting bullshit but evidently it is true best selling cars and trucks are built on lies the rise of fake engine noisedba aba e b eafcb_storyhtml utm_termfbcc
39,the link isnt loading for me but as long as they specify the level of autonomy im fine with it otherwise as soon as we get full self driving its going to be out dated having your car drive you home while drunk is going to be a big selling point edit while your drunk not the car
40,whats the difference from any other system tesla is not on the hook if you wreck using autopilot and its the same for ford or any other company selling drive assist features
