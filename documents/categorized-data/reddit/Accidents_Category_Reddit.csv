0,or bring back trains and trams its the american illusion of a car autonomy that kills us cities
1,i think its control the ultimate planned obsolescence product an electric self driving car a simple software glitch or update and the battery life falls off want to fix it it only costs the cost of a new car just buy a new car uncle sam loves it because he can finally tell you when you travel and when you dont uh oh you took part in a unapproved anti government protest freedom credits your car no longer functions i have yet to see a single smart bit of technology that actually worked for the person its always control consumption is control technology is not being used to free us its going to enslave us its always a product a service something you dont control on a related note somewhat the more i read into the quality of renewable fuels like ethanol and biodiesel the more oil seems like the biggest scam i have ever seen rockefeller backed temperance movements with millions to wipe out the ethanol industry his biggest competition the modern car is a money sink and it doesnt need to be designed to fall apart and get you to buy another i just want a simple repairable motor vehicle that i can run on homemade ethanol something i can fix it doesnt even need to be fast if i could i would go mph tops
2,its a catch transit actually sucks so you have to have a car to get around but everyone having a car to get around means everything sprawls out and makes transit incredibly inefficient and expensive per passenger mile if planners were smart they would use fees and subsidies as levers to push sdcs to feed people into transit lines fewer transit lines with higher frequency means better performance
3,i think its going to be the normal after a decade its simply too lucrative to not happen quite literally gas stations have put ads on a gas pump because why not captive audience this is an even more captive audience and better yet one thats dependent on their device to get them where theyre going
4,marketing major and professional here i know i know op raises a good point about how theres a lot of psychology behind marketing thats a class in and of itself which is fascinating but definitely beyond the scope of intro however consumer behavior studies have found significant differences in how women shop vs men it is an important distinction to make there are a lot of studies to back up that distinction and its not necessarily sexist there are plenty of exceptions to the rule but when you have a marketing budget youre not going to target exceptions we want to group people together by purchasing habits and if there is a woman whos shopping in hm say shes likely buying into cyclical fashion not buying the cheaply made cheaply priced pieces for life as a general rule of thumb knowing who makes up the majority of your clientele is absolutely vital so you can target them in an integrated marketing campaign there is absolutely a lot of difference in how women perceive things how they interpret information which kinds of advertisements are more effective to them etc theres a classic article that all marketing students have read regarding this http knowledgewhartonupenneduarticlemen buy women shop the sexes have different priorities when walking down the aisles it might be how he says it but remember a lot of marketing professors are sleazy but there is nothing inheritantly sexist and bigoted in the source material
5,the following is a copy of the original post to record the post as it was originally written imagine a world where autonomous vehicles self driving cars become commonplace and overwhelmingly prove to be vastly superior to non autonomous vehicles regular cars a world where car accidents and car deaths are unheard of a world where pedestrians being hit by self driving cars is unheard of lets say we achieve this future where self driving cars are a significant portion of the cars out there and nobody on the planet can deny their efficacy and vast superiority over human drivers would you support banning non autonomous vehicles or would there be an element of individual freedom that outweighs the lives lost i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subredditmessagecompose toraskaliberal if you have any questions or concerns
6,i think once autonomous cars are the norm the majority of accidents will be caused by people being demonstrably bad drivers doing the wrong thing on the road so the automated car couldnt react safely and once that happens i think thered be a strong public safety argument to do such a ban im honestly not sure if id support it but i can see that the argument would reasonably exist
7,no i would never support a ban of non autonomous vehicles there will always be people who are not comfortable with the technology plus it is extremely unlikely the technology will be accident proof in our lifetimes or even before or possibly after the technology would have to be absolutely accident and failure free before anyone jumps in with of course it will be safe by xxxx year you need to go back and look at the things predicted to be commonplace now that arent here yet or even coming along anytime soon
8,what happens if they gain sentience and decide to kill their driver even if that wasnt possible i still wouldnt be comfortable not controlling the vehicle
9,this is a delicate question it depends on a lot of factors there would be vast differences in attitudes between urban suburban and rural drivers their access to public transport would be vastly different as well and their access to features such as wireless charging accident avoidance infrastructure communication vehicle to vehicle for example would all be different based on whats available also there is a major set of people who enjoy driving this could continue via private roads though which would mostly be a large improvement in liability and safety driving could be a dedicated hobby which may prove out to be excellent compared to today
10,sure given a few prerequisites human induced accidents would have to be a major danger still and self driving vehicles or car alternatives would have to be as accessible as cars are for a transition period it may be good to have a grandfather clause so people who cant afford a new vehicle can keep their old one
11,i think the onus is the expectation that non autonomous vehicles will always function and perform perfectly technology is prone to glitches and failure rates do i think that non autonomous vehicles that never crash or cause injury are ideal of course but we dont live in a utopian society and i dont believe this technology will exist in our lifetime
12,i used to think this way but have since changed my mind this video is worth watching for some reasons why voafmniu but a good summary would be public transportation is the actual solution to the problems of traffic and accidents that said your question is if they were the perfect solution should driving your own car be banned and to that i say no i would support the creation of self driving lanes being added to highways however there is are cost sustainability and flexibility issues associated with autonomous vehicles that prevent them from being the only option in my mind i would also suggest that the solution is reducing the number of cars in our cities period regardless of whether they are autonomous or not i would really recommend checking out the video though its a good watch
13,not accident free just significantly and undeniably better than regular cars would comfort outweigh lives saved
14,if you want to drive a car with head level spikes instead of a bumper should that be allowed whats my life worth if you kill me
15,but what happens once ai is better at determining that than humans when humans taking over from the ai causes more accidents than it prevents
16,they should also be subject to criminal strict liability in the event that they injure or kill someone
17,if self driving cars do become the norm which i do not think will happen in our life time human operated vehicles will eventually have to die out because the human makes an exponential amount of errors relative to a self driving car the reason i do not think it will happen soon is because for there to be any sense of autonomous driving on the current system of roads there needs to be a minimum uniform code in the algorithm such that cars of different makes can communicate with each other say for example two cars traveling in opposite directions meet across from each other in an intersection and both want to turn east when humans operate vehicles this is easy because its just plain human interaction on the other hand if these cars are self driving both cars need to know when where and at what speed the other car is going to make the east turn why because if they dont they will go at the same time and hit each other trying to make the east turn at the same time this is a fundamental problem transitioning to an autonomous transportation system and i dont think private car manufacturers will be open to sharing their autonomous driving code with each other so in short i dont think you have to worry about existing in a world where you will be forced to adopt an autonomous driving vehicle
18,i mean it would technically be in the publics best interest to stay home all day and never interact with strangers thats a very different riskbenefit calculation than the one that is the the topic of this article american were killed by cars in in my estimation whatever jollies people get from being behind the wheel arent worth a single one of those lives
19,i dont think it would be acceptable to ban one form of transport for safety reasons for another that was not safe in addition if its between someone being able to get around or not because they dont trust the technology then they should be able to drive themselves comfort has always outweighed lives saved approximately million people are killed in fatal crashes each year on average thats about deaths a day globally an additional million are injured or accident statistics no one has banned cars yet

23,for my part i think cartraffic laws have gotten out of hand in some places just conceding that there arent a whole lot of meaningful hills left to die on
24,its far from complete the key point here is if human input shall always override the computer input then banning non autonomous car will become meaning less and you wont want computer control surpasses manual control eg max crash
25,in addition if its between someone being able to get around or not because they dont trust the technology then they should be able to drive themselves what if i dont trust you to drive yourself can i be able to have the technology drive you instead comfort has always outweighed lives saved approximately million people are killed in fatal crashes each year on average thats about deaths a day globally an additional million are injured or disabled no one has banned cars yet yeah thats objectively bonkers excuse me for not wanting to sacrifice myself so you can operate your cool toy

28,my point is we have govt regulations that specify how high a bumper should be so that suvs dont just crush smaller cars in accidents and thats a really good thing if we have a path to reduce road deaths even further we should take it my right to not die is more important than your right to drive recreationally on major highways or city streets

30,no retesting very few actual skills taught poor driving habits are not corrected or even addressed driving is more of a right than a privilege so someone will pass unless they arejust so bad they cant keep it together for a half assed job fit like minutes other than that its just a quick multiple choice exam that is a deep as a puddle
31,i think youd be surprised to hear about autopilot we had a plane crash just last week in san diego county because the inexperienced pilot turned off the autopilot on a lear jet
32,i think youd be surprised to hear about autopilot we had a plane crash just last week in san diego county because the inexperienced pilot turned off the autopilot on a lear jet
33,i cant say i disagree i dont think cars are very safe when they were first being popularized the opponents called them molochian devices for good reason accidents srop being accidental when we just accept them as a part of daily life
34,well food eating is fundamentally just a way for our bodies to intake nutrients and carbohydrates for energy bad food is essentially just base pleasure that creates a lot of risks but you are claiming that because driving creates dangerous externalities that this is fundamentally a different issue but plenty of freedoms come with risky externalities i mean accidents are like number in terms of causes of death which includes unintentional drowning should we ban swimming pools and beach access since theres no purpose aside from enjoyment that these things are allowed to be used

36,americans were killed by cars in hows that for a start
37,im prepared to accept that for the freedom to drive my own car people died every year from drowning but i dont hear anyone saying we should ban swimming
38,also yes people have accidentally fallen into pools and off promenades and drowned leaving these dangerous things open to the public is a risk
39,im prepared to accept that for the freedom to drive my own car its so nice of you to volunteer others to sacrifice themselves for your enjoyment unfortunately ill pass because whatever joy you and every other driver on earth get from being behind the wheel all of it together it doesnt add up to even one of those lives people died every year from drowning but i dont hear anyone saying we should ban swimming can you endanger others by swimming or only yourself because cars dont only endanger their drivers they also endanger others who never offered not be part of your hobby
40,yet americans were killed by cars in if the technology gets to the point where it allows us to take a huge chunk out of that number perhaps virtually all of it we should do it and if you lived where i do youd wonder about those drunk year olds
41,if an autonomous car hits and kills someone who is liable the driver or the car manufacturer
42,i dont think the replies are in favor of driving but more the freedom to have the option i personally would never drive again if this was a real option i hate driving but not as much as i hate police states and governmental over reach throwing axes in the middle of the street is just not an honest comparison ive driven my entire life and never killed a single person most people have in fact but if i started throwing axes in public id probably injure or kill someone in less than a week good drivers who honestly enjoy driving or perhaps just dont trust automation shouldnt be punished for other peoples mistakes just like we dont ban driving on holidays because its the time when the most drunk drivers are out we punish the individuals responsible not the entire society
43,those types of techniques can certainly reduce the incidence of false positives but in situations with enough vehicles and specular reflective surfaces your system can easily have very low confidence i used to work with vector templating system that can auto align using lasers and retro reflective material and even with all the tricks we lock out the ability to align two heads at the same time that are too close together these types of visual systems are very sensitive to interference i mean i worked on systems that needed thou accuracy on stationery mounts but i can certainly see a half dozen lidar scanners in very close proximity causing enough interference to atleast lower the confidence enough to make them significantly less reliable not to mention due to the fact that if a company wanted to use visible light lasers for improved range eyesafe and r systems are still incredibly distance limited for dynamically mounted sensors generally use at least other machine vision technology is needed to have adequate active track most of the vehicles that i have seen equipped with lidar systems are also using or other additional methods like machine vision with cameras and actual radar there is a reason we dont see automotive lidar on vehicles outside of experimental self driving applications and close to the ground warehouse autos controlled by a single server or coordinated through a hivemind iot architecture that is also supported by a server teslas decision to forgo lidar altogether didnt happen by accident its far easier to coordinate disparate devices when the scanners you are using arent emitters
44,most self driving cars use a combination of lidar and cameras so interference is not much of a problem some existing cars use radar for range finding on their automatic cruise control and automatic crash avoidance there is some potential for interference there if you had two cars of the same model that were almost side by side for example im not sure what if any mechanism they use to avoid that
45,great answer how badly do differences in material create interferances in the signal echo just as an example what if i were driving behind a truck that had a large foam box hanging out of its trunk could the sensor accidentally interpret the distance to the truck was double my actual distance
46,if this is the case couldnt a scrambler of some sort be very cheaply made to make untraceable interference that cycles frequencies like an accident machine just set it up in your trunk and wait for someone to rear end you
47,lnmagic sounds right but why is the bandwidth limited in the first place for radar the answer is the fcc and the equivalent regulatory bodies in other countries for example theres a mhz range of frequencies centered near mhz called the industrialscientificmedical ism band where youre allowed to transmit a lot of radar power if you expand out of that mhz bandwidth your allowed transmit power drops precipitously
48,i dont know how they work but the military has missiles that can home in on jamming signals where the jamming signal is able to confuse their radar they just go for the jamming signal instead this implies deliberate interference is both detectable and locatable somehow also im sure the car is logging or recording all the signals from its sensors in a crash whoever is investigating will download the logs from the car and will see the radar suddenly go weird its entirely possible that this might be regarded as suspicious depending on how the radar works
49,yes if the cars are sharing data then cars could react to things they cant yet sense going around a corner a lead car or a car coming from another direction could detect an animal in the road and tell the cars behind it to slow down maybe there are changing road conditions like a puddle mudslide ice etc this would not only make other self driving cars safer but it would potentially give human drivers more time to react leading to fewer secondary accidents pileups also as of last year googles car used lidar for small details which has problems in the rain snow so a car might not be able to accurately sense the road conditions until the traction control system tells the car about it which doesnt happen until the tires actually drive over the surface synced cars would make them all safer by giving them more data to base their decisions on
50,i think youre correct it probably isnt worth it to completely eliminate the chance since its so small but its interesting to think about how a solution would be implemented how much would it cost compared to the actual system and it would be worth it at all then again there could be ways to use that technology the one im proposing not the one they currently use maliciously probably have a device that tells the car im using all these frequencies except this one then the car is forced to use that single frequency then the malicious car could jam that frequency and blind the victim potentially causing an accident if no other security measures are in place for such an eventuality
51,good points i work for honda we use millimeter radar for our adaptive cruise control combined with the forward looking camera driving in heavy wet snow the system shut down on me accord hybrid touring with just a small amount of snow covering the radar sensor also if that accord got into a small accident and the radar sensor has to be replaced thatll be about just for the part
52,the exact same attack can be done on a human driver with nothing but a high powered flashlight at the end of the day you cant make anything perfectly safe against an attacker with unlimited time and funds to develop an attack thats the lesson weve learned from millenia of war offense will always win given enough time and money as silly as it seems if you want to kill someone badly enough you could get a nuke on the black market and simply vaporize their autonomous car
53,im a tech at the service center in marysville yes the car will keep itself in the lane on a straight road if you dont have your hands on the wheel for more than sec it will beep at you if you continue to keep your hands off the wheel it will suspend the lane keep assist the acc system will bring the car down to mph with the brakes but will then cancel below that speedacura has low speed follow the collision mitigation braking system will help lower the severity of a crash but it wont prevent it if the cmb system has to step in youre going to hit something
54,note that cars have both camera and radar but it is scary to think that a driverless car will allow someone totally asleep to be driving along unable to react if the machine is compromised no different from a rear seat passengfer in a car if the driver has a fit at speed what can said passenger do or a passenger in an aircraft those things dont actually need pilots anymore but the lawyers wont let us get rid of them so we still have manual air traffic control and everytime one crashes its human error theyd be safer uncrewed

56,log the event and upload it to central traffic control and twitter perhaps see what your camera says chances are if the conspiracy is this strong against you you will crash anyway but the world might know about it even if that comes from taking the black box recorder apart
57,as a student i worked with people who have aphasia and their spouses for a few semesters most of the individuals i worked with suffered strokes but there were a few who had other traumatic brain injuries head injury sustained in a motorcycle accident for example which resulted in impaired ability to communicate while some of the individuals with tbi seemed entirely aware of their communication deficiencies they seemed to be less aware of differences in terms of emotional reactions and personality traits so while one individual had difficulty with word retrieval he also lost his ability to censor or filter his speech for social appropriateness and was dealing with some impulsivity issues as well i would have to agree that theres no black and white answer to this question since the nature and severity of brain injuries vary on a case by case basis
58,yes and no some patients have very severe injuries that affect primarily physical function rather than cognition leaving them aware but unable to use their bodies some have mild injuries where they are physically intact and have no concept of reality
59,here http conditionid and here http are some case studies the ones with testimonials may provide an insight into your question it is my understanding that people who have these disabilities will simply recognize an inability to function as they used to unless the memory of that previous functioning is damaged as well
60,for the example of self driving cars even with accidents we can start to prevent these in the future by improving the underlying algorithms at some point if self driving cars take off then were giving more control to algorithms to run a big aspect of our lives however it is quite likely that the total number of accidents gets reduced compared to having human only drivers how do we then approach this ethical dilemma giving up control to a black box black box for most people who dont know whats gone into it and potentially hurting individuals in exchange for improving the lives of people in general i would naively argue its worth convincing society that this is okay because it will save lives but really is it
61,thanks for the informed question i am hopeful i think we can and should build a framework to evaluate the inputs the models and the outputs there are statistical criteria one uses in say regression models to assess how good a model is they need to be extended to include tests for things such as bias in the inputs outputs gender race etc implications for privacy security etc procedurally i also think that algorithms deployed in socially significant settings should be audiedvalidated by a team other than the team that developed the model such a team can be within the org or a rd party but such procedures will also help you may also find the area of fairness accountability transparency in ml fatml interesting
62,without any doubt in my mind its a fundamental shift in technology just like internet mobile and cloud computing have been modern ai based algorithms are here to stay advanced algorithms deployed in medical diagnostic systems will save lives advanced algorithms deployed in driverless cars can reduce accidents and fatalities advanced algorithms deployed in finance can lower the fees we all pay to invest our savings but we will have many growing pains along the way driverless car fatalities algorithm bias trading algorithms messing up etc but to discard them now would be like stone age man deciding to reject the use of fire because it can be tricky to control so the question is how do we manage them in the long run
63,yes the paper is here http fowlerucsdedumassive_turnoutpdf it provides all the relevant details regarding study design and findings they have done other studies example if the newsfeed can affect your mood etc i have described these experiments in
64,does anyone feel that self driving cars that talk to each other could be a bad thing i know it sounds like an ideal situation to eliminate traffic accidents and all that but i think and this is just me but can the cars be hacked information passing wirelessly between vehicles without human intervention leaves a lot of trust concerns should we start using self driving cars to transport our children to soccer practice it will happen trust me i dont think we are moving in the right direction on this idea
65,sure there is potential for abuse but the same is true of any new technology you could also say that cars themselves are a danger because they move so much faster than horse drawn carriages people will die from problems with driver less cars the question is will more lives be saved overall from the safety improvements i would say yes
66,they share the same set of rules they can even predict how other cars will behave this is most important part right now our ability to coordinate with other drivers without being able to communicate is based on humans understanding and following traffic protocols i dont know exact numbers but i would suspect that upwards of of all traffic accidents are a result of humans failing to properly follow these protocols passing on the right going too fast following too closely etc at issue is that humans are greedy buggers who are only concerned with personal short term consequences so these protocols are often treated more like suggestions people generally dont care that rapidly changing lanes without signalling reduces the total throughput of the highway by x just that they are late to their dentist appointment imagine if airline pilots or train conductors thought the same way once we eliminate human drivers from the road entirely lots of these issues just go away a computer will never decide that it is ok to drive slowly in the left lane or roll through a stop sign it will follow the protocols put into place exactly as they were intended to be followed and traffic fatalities could drop into the hundred or dozens
67,the first approach in every situation of what is there to stop a person from severely annoying or endangering others is laws that say you must not well make it illegal to send false signals between driverless cars in most areas of life this is completely sufficient of people see it as socially unacceptable to break laws are sufficiently put off by the danger of getting caught to attempt breaking laws and the rest are hopefully caught and punished after the fact numbers made up on the spot for example there is nothing stopping me from punching a random stranger in the face tomorrow but i dont want to i wont because its wrong and i dont want to go to jail there is nothing stopping me from driving drunk and crashing into oncoming traffic tomorrow except not wanting to and not wanting to go to jail computer scientists often forget about laws and social rules as a substitute for technology because on the internet its very difficult to enforce laws breaking into computers without permission is illegal but if the criminals are half a world away it does not work in practice if it is reasonably possible to catch the false signal senders after the fact just a law is sufficient protection and no complex technology is required
68,this may always be an issue just as a sudden overpass collapse or a drunken driver going the wrong way are also possible there will be incidents where vehicles are involved in accidents however i think the point of developing a massive networked and semi autonomous systems is that in cases of accident a car accident will result instead of a car pile up whats more in such a circumstance traffic can be rerouted you dont have looky loo problems and emergency services will be alerted and arrive that much sooner its not about being foolproof but being vastly more efficient and safer than our human run system
69,its also important to note that ptc cant override the laws of physics if a truck gets stuck on tracks at a crossing and a train doesnt have time to stop a crash will still happen thats weird since the technology for that exists and is used on german bullet train tracks http honeywellcomsitesaero regelsystemeproduktesdocumentsrs_e_pdf still great to hear that america is finally prioritizing train safety
70,had to respond to something similar recently was in my apartment and heard a loud crash some kid had a seizure or something and plowed into our complexs security gate had to jump the fence and call luckily no one was hurt in a way we kind of already have some autonomous systems to at least minimize the effect of such accidents certain cars models since around have had collision mitigation systems not widespread but a good start that im sure has saved a number of lives

72,not pullen park http train hit by carhtml and not the accident i was thinking about at all weird it looked so similar to what i remember
73,i expect you to die mr bond
74,pedestrians trying to cross this intersection guess ill die
75,even self driving cars would have mechanical failures and cause and accident i dont trust this shit
76,one car makes a mistake and everyone dies
77,cars would stop whenever a pedestrian approaches and not whenever they feel like it maybe also accidents happen all the time with human drivers too the quesiton is who is more reliable but yes public transport would be suerior oc
78,as if people arent already killed trying to cross intersections that self driving schema isnt the solution but pretending this doesnt already happen is nuts anyone purporting self driving to be perfect and flawless is selling snake oil the actual goal of self driving is to be better than people are not perfect and that bar is pretty low the most common reason for car accidents is sleepiness affecting response time

80,this is a horrible case of overengineering not taking in account any human factors ask yourself would i want to be in that car that is doing a left turn while being approached from different angles by other cars at full speed that just narrowly avoid you it would be like being in a constant state of almost accidents
81,kind of like most se asian countries no traffic lights no deaths or accidents at intersections everything just flows
82,imagine being in one of those cars and being about to crash like times before getting to work
83,i totally agree with rfuckcars i am a biker but this right here stupid software bug away from death this will have a lot less maybe zero people killed than the drinking idiots out on the road right at this moment so no i do not agree
84,yeah try this on indian roads you will definitely see a heap of crashed cars in probably a few mins not to mention cows and dogs jumpng over em
85,youre also one drunk driver away from death one texting driver away from death one distracted driver away from death one speeding to show off driver away from death one road raging driver away from death human drivers kill way more people than computer drivers ever would
86,you see elon with his galaxy brain and big boy pants has the solution self driving humans with neuralink drilled into your skull youll just be in perfect time with the cars as long as the implant doesnt kill you and you dont mind a private company having access to your brain you can even pay a monthly premium subscription to get rid of the ads that fill your vision and constantly ring in your ears
87,i challenge you to be in one of these cars and not crap your pants as a dozen other cars come within a foot of crashing into you as you cross the intersection
88,go back in time kill all the auto company executives that were gutting public transportation change the entire course of history when it comes to infrastructure then come back and cross the road otherwise youre going to have to rip up literally this entire country to remake it so that public transport works
89,to be fair since self driving cars are both overly cautious and forced to prevent crashing into a pedestrian at all costs you could cross this intersection by literally just walking across it in any direction at any time if they are self driving cars they will stop assuming they can see you and have enough time etc
90,well if theyre self driving you just walk across the cars will stop or more likely a bridge and the title one software bug causing an accident is less likely than a regular idiot driver causing an accident
91,skill
92,wow cool what could go wrong and kill a bunch of people cell tower outage power outage lane striping fades road construction someone drives their own car snow flurry falling leaves flat tire person walks or bikes software gets out of date or hacked squirrel chews on a gadget bird poops on a sensor
93,ok but like can hackers or whatever not just be able to cause crashes and such seems a bit to dangerous if you ask me
94,ok but like can hackers or whatever not just be able to cause crashes and such seems a bit to dangerous if you ask me
95,in the news the location sensor in car reading was off by feet people died
96,human cause lots of accidents and are stupid i cant wait for automated cars
97,its not their fault you have had access to games like frogger and crossy road for decades if you didnt build up your skills that is on you s i suppose you will expect someone to come save you during the zombie apocalypse too
98,this is a really shitty algorithm but a more robustfault tolerant one would likely work provided the car rollout and infrastructure changes are achieved which is a big task the devil is entirely in the implementation details so until we have a system to prototype its difficult to make any sweeping assertions k people die in the us every year from automobile accidents

100,this will never happen because if a single cars sensors were off by just a bit it could cause serious accidents and even a pileup this is also not considering the fact that if a single car needed to brake during this process you have a pileup so either the cars need to be going so slowly through these intersections that there is no point to this design or its a recipe for disaster
101,id literally never sit in a car again if every intersection had a strong chance of putting my car within half a foot of a t bone accident lol
102,truthfully whats worse being one software bug away from being killed or being killed by a human whos probably texting their bff about some useless drama they created in the first place
103,good news elon already thought of it you die
104,not a future i want to live in with all those near crashes
105,not a future i want to live in with all those near crashes
106,youre not supposed to youre supposed to be rich or die
107,build a train if we built more trains that wouldnt get rid of cars because they both have their own uses we already have roads so we might as well use them potholes youre right we would need a well maintained road for this to work crosswalk they could still exist similar to how these cars communicate with each other a crosswalk button could communicate with the cars software bug car crashes over million car crashes happen in the us per year from human error should we not allow humans to drive

109,arent driverless cars programmed to avoid killing pedestrians id say just go for it
110,today in the news a software glitch caused a car pile up on the i only deaths were recorded as engineers at the manufacturer pointed out this is only the second accident this month bringing the total of deaths to which is still far below the average of gas cars before they were phased out also in the news year olds can they help with the labor shortages
111,go ahead die
112,honestly self driving cars could potentially make the roads safer for pedestrians as theoretically obviously this would be different in practice a self driving car should never hit a pedestrian and would always stop or avoid them most pedestrian accidents happen because the driver was distracted or did not correctly follow traffic laws niether of which would be a problem for self deiving cars so essentially if you are a pedestrian trying to get across this road all you would need to do is walk across and pray that there isnt some bug in the self deiving system
113,there was a guy down in mexico city at the unam who tested some accident preventing tech in mini cars and it made them virtually accident proof this was more than a decade ago i am sure today it is even safer the problem is the one person who refuses to let anything else drive their car
114,not just a software bug if any of these cars experience some hardware failure so they have to stop they all fucking crash
115,its called a pedestrian bridge over the intersection pretty cheap actually in comparison to all the resources spent on emergency services for crashes
116,its called a pedestrian bridge over the intersection pretty cheap actually in comparison to all the resources spent on emergency services for crashes
117,pedestrian bridges ive seen some natural bridges over highways that are just beautiful even though studies show that predators learn that is an easy source of meal so each bridge is guarded by bears or wolfs in nyc we call them gangs themoreyouknow
118,and then theres one car with a small bug and causes an insane crash
119,thats what we call it mans world no accidents
120,theres no reason to make up new driving rules for automated traffic flow that would make things difficult for times where manual driving is needed or for pedestrians synchronizing traffic lights utilizing alternate routes proportionally and avoiding hazards and construction would erase the majority of traffic and congestion while also decreasing travel speed which also results in better safety for cyclists and pedestrians cars would be networked at that point along with traffic signals and things like debris on the road downed power lines potholes etc would all be able to be reported in real time to the proper departments so wed see a decrease in say power outage durations during storms automatic ride sharing options would also decrease the amount of vehicles on the roads which in turn benefits all of the above the lives saved alone will be worth it the reduction of accidents will be astronomical and ticketting police would be virtually eliminated on the roads theyd need to find new ways to generate revenue
121,the title is a little misleading because honestly for every software bug a self driving car has at least x of humans would of crashed on their own
122,more lanes has even been shown to not help traffic times at this point the grip corporations has on everything has put us to where we wont be able to make the green deadlines since all those heads are going to die before we all get to suffer the climate change there isnt much of an incentive to do anything

131,yep the thing that makes lights unbearable is acceleration this does not solve that issue any system worth its salt would slow cars down ahead of the intersection so that when they arrive its perfectly their turn slowing down over stopping would also save energy but yeah this is stupid and is going to kill people so its never going to happen
132,because americans are terrible at them we have a couple in the cities and theyre always extremely stressful for me ive only been in one accident and it was at a roundabout the girl was on her phone and not looking hit me from behind and almost pushed my car into moving traffic she didnt understand why i was slowing down at the yield its not even a stop
133,then you have no clue how far ai has come as long as we have humans at the wheel kids will die its beyond atrocious that you propagate that to be fair i said i trust but i should have said the data already shows that ai is safer you should research some topics before you write out things that arent true

141,liability is going to be a problem though now even if a car completely malfunctions resulting in an accident the driver is still mainly responsible for any accidents car manufacturers would be held liable for any accidents caused by self driving cars and they dont want that
142,hm i beg to differ in this one unreliable equipment that doesnt kill en masse is fine but this is a little over the top since the payers for this system are rich and could net us more profits what i say we do is create a free system for crossing that has a death rate then let people pay for ones with lower death rates getting gradually more safe the more youre willing to pay
143,no all these people dying and crashed into are just the few broken eggs that need to be sacrificed for the data once enough people are plowed into well have the data to make a car utopia
144,if you saw conclusive data that showed fewer crashes per mile would you change your mind youre totally correct humans and computers make different kinds of mistakes but if we knew with certainty that computers make fewer mistakes would you still feel the same way

146,you think self driving cars of the future wont be able to tell the difference between a truck and a garbage can dodo you think they just use motion detectors like outdoor lights or something image recognition is already a thing in these systems also all that other stuff can be programmed in what they cant do is make moral judgement calls without a preprogrammed response eg swerve left and hit a car on the left or swerve right and hit a pole that will kill the driver or keep straight and hit a bicyclist and it draws up a ton of legal issues on the notion of fault like if it swerved left and the car spun out and a family of all died whos fault is that not the drivers anymore

148,which in my experience in spite of being safer and decreasing the risk of accidents and traffic jams rarely ever happens if the rules of the road were followed to a t instead of having of drivers thinking theyre better than most drivers and being ok disobeying the rules because theyre familiarity with a car outruled their sense of dangerresponsibility instead of having selfish drivers who arbitrarily decide to get ahead of everyone else despite no inherent need for it instead of everyone creating barely an inch gap between cars or taking advantage of those with enough space by forcing yourself in there the road would be much safer and more efficient which is why trains rule
149,thats a bad driver problem she would and probably has done the same thing at a stoplight stoplights are also statically far worse for causing accidents so your anecdote is doubly bad
150,the majority of americans do not like them which is represented by everything regarding the topic dont need to come with your america is diverse talking point no shit some people like them but most dont there are studies and surveys about this dude
151,car manufacturers would be held liable for any accidents caused by self driving cars and they dont want that thats not the status quo drivers currently retain all liability for accidents caused by self driving cars do you really think the situation will change to the detriment of car manufacturers
152,a perfectly free well optimized economy would therefore have a flourishing market in killbots
153,die walkling
154,and since we already have to build the tunnels we could line the tunnels with some kind of metal beams to reduce the risk of them crashing into the tunnel walls this would also allow them to go faster
155,oh the hyperloop if you ignore the difficulty in building a vacuum tube that is millions of cubic feet and then the time and effort required to make sure that all of the thousands of seals required on that massive tube stay intact and how all of this infrastructure would be an order of magnitude more expensive than just building a normal rail line and that any emergency in the hyperloop becomes a hyperemergency due to trying to rescue people out of a confined space and how theyre one accident away from a catastrophic explosive decompression its still not a great idea
156,you think a garage is not taking space in a city i was specifically referencing the idea that car sharing would mean less cars on the road you know like what i quoted also how i said isnt clogging up the roads should have been enough there right citation needed you wont find a citation for this because its an opinion based on observation not a studied fact see uberscabs in cities now thats technically the same as an autonomous car that is used by many it just has a manual driver for now have we seen less traffic with the introduction of these services it doesnt seem like it feel free to refute this properly with your own citations but im just having a conversation not writing a paper if anything they help reducing traffic missing the point they introduced a massive amount of these things because as a company you want them to always be available the same will be true of any company pushing out a fleet of autonomous vehicles designed to arrive to your home quickly the service will fail if people miss their appointments due to waiting on a car to be available i wasnt commenting on whether the scooters reduced traffic or not
157,if you watch closely youll see there are times where cars moving perpendicular to each other very narrowly slide past each other even if these cars can react faster they dont go from to instantly humans going the same way and following traffic lights may not be prone to the type of accidents an intricately weaved blob of fast cars might have
158,yeah theres a lot of shit drivers here most of my job is looking into restrictions from duis yikes again but for requirements its similar here in theory but not that strenuous eta i may be underestimating the requirements based on memory i am not involved in the licensing process when i did this a decade ago i think it was hours of practice required plus optional driving school a mandatory driving skills test very lenient honestly as a teen i wasnt a good driver but i passed a knowledge test rules of the road i found it easy but if i took it now it might be harder a lot of laws are really finicky and a fee nobody explained how to maintain a car change a tire jump a battery etc it was just can you operate the vehicle and not kill someone
159,also my favourite an old woman who barely knows where she is kills someone with an suvjeep nobody cares and even pities the old woman meanwhile someone accidentally touches someone else with their e scooter and cnnbbcguardianevery news site starts a campaign to get them banned and have the e scooter riders executed

161,a hsve nearly been killed several times as a pedestrian controlled intersection walk sign and some idiot turning right or left into me
162,kill every year in the usa injure over a million people in usa alone
163,you forgot kills people a day in the us
164,fucking this and god forbid you ride your bike on the sidewalk people bitch at you ride in the street like just because i have wheels i belong with all the two ton killing machines fuck off if youre too uncomfortable with a bike strolling past you on the sidewalk at mph then you shouldnt be outside in the first place
165,bikers are free to try the rest may die trying wanna occupy the road follow the rules or get the fuck on a bike path
166,cyclists break a lot more rules than cycling through stop signs which is no small thing either and can cause an accident
167,its so true my mom knows the family who was devastated by this case crash killing ruth burger it should be some clear cut accidental homicide but no she wasnt convicted of the criminal negligence causing death charges and instead got a suspended sentence hours community service years probation a year driving ban for dangerous driving charges and she appealed it i dont care the circumstances if you mow down a family with your car you should go to jail its the risk you take when you get behind the wheel in addition though crash avoidance systems should be made mandatory so these situations never occur in the first place

170,yep here in queens last year maro andrianou nycstreetsblogorgqueens da declines to prosecute driver who killed delivery man was feeling impatient and decided to gun it on a residential street using the bike lane as a passing lane killing xing long lin and plowing straight into an outdoor dining structure wherein a diner was injured she tells some preposterous tale for which there is zero evidence and in fact a fair bit of evidence refuting and the da melinda katz lets her walk away with zero punishment whatsoever not even failure to exercise due care
171,but bikes treating stop signs as yields just makes sense accelerating is harder and slower for bikes plus they have much better vision and hearing and are able to know what is going on much better than any driver and beyond any of that theyre not going to kill anyone who makes a mistake in some places its the law that cyclists treat stop signs as yields thats for a good reason when you stop at a stop sign on a bike its slow and the car drivers get frustrated increasing risk of you being run over or one of them angrily smashing the gas as soon as youre past
172,great but here where i live in the midwest gas guzzling vehicles are god people whine constantly about bike lanes and theres a literal referendum being put on the ballot because a few business owners got pissy at the idea of a road diet because they want a lane monstrosity as the main artery through town so day in and day out those gas guzzler fans go about their day without word regarding their fellow drivers then they witness one person on a bicycle roll through a stop sign and they take to social media to complain there are thousands of cars and trucks on the road here tens or maybe hundreds of bicycles there are significantly more complaints about bicycles
173,the tone of that article makes it sound like that suspended sentence and the other bits is a victory the casual assumption that this is sufficient for the loss of a toddler and an unborn child if my actions whether accidental or express or just by sheer bungling caused the death of two children i would not even have any self worth left to defend myself theres no way to make up for that edit and yes its easy to make grandstanding claims behind a keyboard but that case is just ridiculous got my foot stuck under the brake pedal my ass
174,if i expect a car to stop at a stop sign but they dont and it causes an accident its minor injuries and property damage if i expect a cyclist to stop at a stop sign but they dont and it causes an accident its a body bag graveyards are full of people who had the right of way
175,a bad cyclist cant kill a dozen people
176,oh yes for sure there are absolutely no circumstances in which a cyclist could fuck up or ignore the law causing a large accident definitely not
177,oh yeah because i said everyone who does it dies give me a fucking break
178,i mean i dunno about the heavier vehicles being more deadly thing like no matter how heavy a car is if it hits you youre either crippled for the rest of your life or die the weight of the car in this case only decides whether you are crippled or killed and i honestly dont know which one is worse
179,i mean i dunno about the heavier vehicles being more deadly thing like no matter how heavy a car is if it hits you youre either crippled for the rest of your life or die the weight of the car in this case only decides whether you are crippled or killed and i honestly dont know which one is worse
180,just perfectly sums up the fraud that is the notion that electric cars are just a panacea for all of our transport woes better than petrol than diesel but still not good thats not even mentioning all of the indirect emissions from the car centric development electric cars wont fix and its consequences on the environment
181,yes but itll mean minimal lifestyle changes like public transportation and changing our diet would
182,a car is so much heavier than a pedestrian that im pretty sure the car weight just does not matter its the acceleration of the pedestrian that ends up killing them
183,timmy gets propelled at v if pretty much any car hits him this acceleration is what kills him and reflects the car dumping a tiny fraction of its own kinetic energy to make timmy go splat
184,i dont think youre really aware of how cbtc actually works or how efficient trains are also its a lot better to just run as many as possible than to do some weird tech bro efficiency bullshit with it like rail examining the number of people waiting why having people state where theyre going this is horrible ux also why also train tickets turnstyles dynamically allocating trains to provide additional transit as necessary this already happens automatically slowing down certain trains by a couple minutes in order to alleviate congestion in stations what what congestion if theres congestion youd want more trains to move people this screws over people already on the train this makes them unreliable it is better for humans if there are consistent schedules without unexpected delays or speed ups like thats part of what makes taking the bus so horrible you dont know when its going to show up it gets stuck in traffic sometimes they skip your stop because the bus is full or the driver wants to and why would you need regenerative braking in trains do you know how trains work they speed up to the safest maximum speed then cut the power to slow down barely using brakes to come to a complete stop at the station if you ride a subway in a dense area like manhattan youll feel them pedal to the metal about halfway from station to station then they cut the power skilled operators can glide in in fact using the brakes on trains sucks horribly it fucks up your balance can make stuff knock over etc theres literally a japanese metro sim all about getting it as perfect as possible
185,who said theyre magically more aerodynamic evs are range constrained theyll always be designed with a lower drag coefficient than their gasdiesel counterparts why do you think the top most aerodynamic vehicles on the road are all evphev
186,my friend was involved in a car crash the other day he is still in a coma fuck cars
187,now this is a reddit i can get behind im and still havent gotten my license no rush to get it no matter how much im told i need it guess ive seen too many people lose their face in car accidents online lol
188,i hate car because it creates weak people cycling exposes you to the elements driving makes you die quicker basically
189,joining wish i knew that there were other people who agreed on this my best friend died in a car accident in and since then ive been absolutely against driving or even buying a car my parents dont think im being rational but i just do not want to involve myself in driving a car when anything could happen at any point id rather take a public form of transportation thank you

191,re car and truck and train and ships and air plane pollution i still have to drive my car i live in az but on the other hand have you seen how much pollution im not contributing just by changing my diet no infrastructure required no schedule to memorize no exposure to mass transit infection potential just one of the many ways to lower ones contribution to climate change and its a no extra cost option that almost anyone can do dm me if youre interested duckyou and your environmentalism if you arent interested because this is something you can do right now
192,as a newcomer i could not disagree with this community more living densely or cramming into public transport sounds like a futuristic nightmare you guys have a right to an opinion and i respect that but in my opinion this is a terrible hill to die on
193,i leave my diesel truck idling
194,literally nothing worse than cycling out in the country side and some car just passes you by and instantly turns your clean breathable fresh air into a mixture of diesel particles and smelly gasoline exhaust fumes so very much enjoy that
195,yeah but you cant live just thinking about just risk i mean if you want a new knife you cant be affaid about cutting yourself in the end life is risk and in the end we all going to die so i prefer dont think about just risk but thats is what i think
196,i pay ish a month for insurance and ish a month for a car payment the car is literally known as one of the cheapest pieces of plastic shit south korea can legally put on a highway chevy spark i have had full on fantasies about destroying that thing and paying it off with the insurance money i wish i had never set eyes on the damn thing i only use it for grocery shopping and i have to remember to turn it on every week so the just installed rare small size out of stock everywhere had to get a refurbished instead battery doesnt die i hate exercise but this car alone motivated me to get a bike when i move the neighborhood i live in is too unsafe to be outside in
197,i was once traveling in beijing and it was crazy how all motorcycles there were electric and i could hear no noise at all not what i was expecting maybe they have a mandate or subsidies but still
198,theyre often an option where people would otherwise have a car marginal emissions may not be as low as you think compared to a small plug in hybrid unless it is a small lowish power single or twin embodied emissions will be vastly lower they also have far less external risk all in all a decent solution if transit is poor and distances are long something fuckcars would fight for or against depending on context
199,this is a totaly valid point not every village can have a adequate public transport connection just as you need cars to move large items on rare routes like moveing most pepole in here dont want to completly ban all cars we are just advocating for more investments in public transport and an end of subsidies for car ownership
200,in bumper to bumper gridlock on the interstate its not and awesome or not its not worth the negative externalities cars are literally killing us if gas actually cost what it does to the atmosphere and by extension the biome you and i exist in as organic matter itd be thousands a gallon car based infrastructure is a cruel dead end joke
201,yeah but cars kill drastically more people every year than all other forms of transport and take up much more space emissions are like only a small issue here
202,your average person uses motor transit dramatically more often than they use aircraft your average person is dramatically more likely to be killed in a car accident than an aircraft accident moving away from car centric urban planning actually improves the environmental record of shipping and aircraft because it yields viable alternatives with much better efficiency ratings and reducing the need to ship
203,your average person uses motor transit dramatically more often than they use aircraft your average person is dramatically more likely to be killed in a car accident than an aircraft accident moving away from car centric urban planning actually improves the environmental record of shipping and aircraft because it yields viable alternatives with much better efficiency ratings and reducing the need to ship
204,except we have no alternative and people could quite possibly like actually die without the food they bring but yes people should stop overconsumption so that we need fewer ships to carry cargo overseas and we should be researching ways to make cargo ships less polluting keep in mind though cargo ships are really quite efficient and they dont cause pollution due to road wear
205,one car emits a mix of diesel and gasoline exhaust
206,when i list off the number of close relatives that died in car accidents or were injured it makes it a lot more obvious
207,when i list off the number of close relatives that died in car accidents or were injured it makes it a lot more obvious
208,a few months ago near where i live an suv going kmh legal limit is kmh on a highway lost control hit a cyclist drove over the divider and crashed into an oncoming small car before stopping the cyclist and the driver of the small car died on the spot while all of the suv occupants survived with minor injuries almost no one really understands the risk you are taking everytime you get into a car almost no one really understands the risk everyone else is taking everytime you get into a car

210,yeah exactly i feel weird sometimes for even thinking it there are times where my boss asks me to come in on my day off for a meeting i work part time since im a student and i always feel tempted to let her know how i feel i could die and leave my kid fatherless since my work is an hour away and theres a lot of crazy drivers here in bangkok its a total waste of gas and contributes to pollution just have the meeting on zoom
211,not only the risk of killing or maiming yourself but someone else as well id rather take the slightly higher risk if riding a bike knowing that im not going to accidentally murder someone that day
212,not only the risk of killing or maiming yourself but someone else as well id rather take the slightly higher risk if riding a bike knowing that im not going to accidentally murder someone that day
213,when someone complains about bikes breaking rules invite them to look out the nearest window for minutes and count the violations by drivers even if cyclists broke rules and drivers didnt so what cyclists dont kill anybody
214,well id first like to point out that formula e is now a thing and its definitely growing in popularity i personally really enjoy watching it but getting to your point i think you have to understand that just like any other industry the racing industry is well an industry its job is to make money through entertaining people it really really relies on the people sitting at home watching formula nascar the wrc or whatever through their televisions and the fact of the matter is many of those people arent exactly fond of the whole electric car movement just for a second imagine a nascar enthusiast now maybe its just me but my mind immediately jumped to someone a lot like my grandfather a heavily conservative older gentleman who hates anything and everything perceived as liberal including electric cars see regardless of what the racing industry would like to do theyre really binded to what their audience wants loud obnoxious gas guzzling vehicles zooming around a circuit and honestly i would be lying if i said i didnt enjoy those things too until that changes racing is absolutely going to remain gasoline centric
215,aight here we go it isnt the existence of cars that is responsible for climate change it isnt the existence of cars that is responsible for climate change people cheap out and buy old cars or big trucks and never ever think about fuel efficiency and people often drive to the same location in multiple cars decreasing efficiency cars arent dangerous humans are laws just dont allow autopilot systems therefor they arent developed almost all crashes are caused by human error this is full on right nothing to debate here lol this is made worse tho because of course you need the biggest truck with the biggest engine because your pp grows or whatever cars arent even that expensive its only that you are all poor apparently see the nordics cars cost like times as much there if you dont live in a big city you can not use public transport whats the alternative this is the result of poor planning oh wait see you use a car to go to multiple places there cant be less parking places than cars there must be more if you want to park your car there must be that many parking spaces as sais public transport wont and cant work for other than densely populated areas if you only have passengers per trip the perfect place to fit those and go to a specific location is a automobile what if i continue because this whole debate is idiotic i agree somewhat with you the problem i have is that most of the whole subreddit faces everything from the perspective of the united states of murica and even all most of the sources and suggested videos in the main post are about the f cking us you dont seem to get that this is the world wide web not the freedom network prove me wrong i dare you i want you rip karma

217,i totally agree i take public transport to work the issue is the methods of legislating the car out of the city centre right now in the uk birmingham council are charging per calendar day to drive within the ring road if i head to a venue on an evening and have to load out equipment and drive home at i am charged the ring road contains all of the music venues and the vast majority of rehearsal spaces several of the rehearsal spaces are already making posts about going out of business because of this i have a diesel car i could sell it for k and buy a version for k and then be able to drive into town for free if there was any genuine alternative to driving or selling my car for something else i would do it i cant afford an electric car and dont have a driveway so couldnt charge at home regardless terraced houses in the uk make this impossible in a lot of poorer areas taxis arent appropriate ive previously run charity events putting on regular gigs in liverpool and birmingham and even with a good relationship with certain taxi companies half of the drivers refuse to load amps or drum kits into their car enforce it on the business not the people its exactly the same way companies are responsible for of emissions but the onus is increasingly put onto the individual
218,i knew two unhoused people who were killed by cars running off the road and into their tentson two separate occasions and a third who was murdered using a car as the weapon edit oh ill add one who was mutilated by a cops motorcycle and is now disabled for life
219,people have been killed by a car while sitting in their house its ridiculous
220,youre always safer if you happen to collide with a small car rather than a large one anyway yes that was a bit of a twisting of your words i know thats not what you meant its the truth though those who think that driving big is driving safe or that lightweight fuel efficient vehicles are inherently more dangerous than their heavyweight counterparts need to think again a researcher with lawrence berkeley national lab berkeley lab has teamed with a researcher from the university of michigan in a unique risk analysis study which shows that contrary to conventional wisdom vehicle quality is a much more important safety factor than weight for the drivers of vehicles involved in a crash most cars are safer than the average sports utility vehicle suv while pickup trucks are much less safe than all other types minivans and import luxury cars have the safest records states the report an analysis of traffic deaths by vehicle type and model which was prepared by tom wenzel an energy analyst with berkeley labs environmental energy technologies division and marc ross a professor in michigans applied physics department a shortcoming of many safety analyses has been that only risks to drivers of a given kind of vehicle are evaluated while the risks imposed on others are ignored says wenzel we focused on the risk not only to occupants of the vehicle model in question in all types of crashes but also on the risk to the drivers of other vehicles involved in crashes with the model in question wenzel and ross determined that suvs are no safer for their drivers than the average midsize or large car and not much safer than many of the most popular compact and subcompact car models drivers of pickup trucks are at even greater risk than drivers of suvs when the combined risk is considered suvs and pickup trucks are revealed to be significantly more dangerous than just about any car all the evidence in our study shows that vehicles can be and in fact are being made lighter and more fuel efficient without sacrificing safety says wenzel the argument that lowering the weight of cars to achieve high fuel economy has resulted in excess deaths is unfounded is bigger safer it aint necessarily so articlesarchiveeetd suv safetyhtml berkeley lab in other words when considering size alone it is the size of the vehicle you collide with that is most important not the size of your own by driving a big vehicle all you are really doing is increasing the amount of kinetic energy involved in collisions which is bad however this fact doesnt tend to sell cars and make profit as well as the bigger cars are safer mantra of the advertising industry

222,driving itself is also quite stressful some people handle it better than others but it can be anxiety inducing to drive a pound death machine especially if youve been in crashes before
223,driving itself is also quite stressful some people handle it better than others but it can be anxiety inducing to drive a pound death machine especially if youve been in crashes before
224,this is true thats why i figured theyd be perfect for people in this sub my favorites are the ones about why the suburbs are killing us great stuff
225,one problem a year is quite a low rate i probably call maybe every other month when i drive to report accidents this was pre pandemic of course
226,the infrastructure was built in the s the roads to build cars bulldozed houses and small businesses and closed lots of other businesses by killing foot traffic amsterdam used to be car dependent too but they managed to turn it around
227,worst argument ever its pretty hard to kill someone with a bike or by walking even if there is human error even trains are safer humans will never be efficient and that is why cars are more dangerous
228,just corporations and politicians convincing people that its normal for people to die for profit and the specific people believing it and calling us dumb bc it probably will never happen to them
229,i got hit by an suv while i was crossing the street a few years ago turns out im lucky not to be dead and people get mad when i point out that suvs and other big trucks kill more pedestrians than small cars
230,for sure after i almost died last year on the highway ive resolved to move to new york city so that i wont have to drive again every time i drive im anxious ill get into an accident
231,for sure after i almost died last year on the highway ive resolved to move to new york city so that i wont have to drive again every time i drive im anxious ill get into an accident
232,animal products increase risk of death from multiple causes so point does apply if you care about deaths as just one example the who lists multiple meats as carcinogens cancer causing point does apply its also affecting climate change apinationalgeographiccomdistributionpublicampenvironmentarticlemeat production leads to thousands of air quality related deaths annually point does apply an animal based diet is more expensive finds vegan meals cheaper than meat and fish theconversationcomvegan vegetarian and flexitarian diets could save you money new research point does apply to all of food production greenhouse gases are from animal products while providing nowhere near of the calories disproportionate impact greenhouses gases food production study theres hundreds of sources proving greenhouse gases from animal products and to say otherwise is to deny science point applies to all animal farming some just take up even more than others look up trophic levels and you will see you feed animals a lot more than you get out of them in terms of calories that means either growing more crops to feed them than if you ate the crops directly or giving them a lot of land to graze on or a mixture of both all of which result in a lot more land use a tiny percentage of livestock land couldnt be used for anything else ourworldindataorgland use diets i didnt want to flood my comment with hundreds of sources so ive just included a few of the thousands out there that back up the points i made nope it was an honest question because most subs have people like you who deny science so i was seeing whether this sub was a fit for vegans or not so far the people ive interacted with its on either side the other person who replied to me put it really well the reasons given in this post would lead to people reducing their intake of animal products not necessarily elimination obviously to go vegan you need the animal ethics too so my question maybe should have been worded differently i assume people are already reducing intake of animal products based on their morals and why they are here some even vegan so im guessing this is a vegan friendly place i guess that would have been a better thing for me to say you are the one who brought their anti vegan and anti science discussion here from me asking a question about the people in this sub and whether its a fit for me or not
233,and what cars dont make u feel unsafe i take it youve never been in an accident before
234,anti science yeah no fuck you not being signed up to your ethical agenda is not anti science animal products increase risk of death from multiple causes by anywhere near million deaths a year no so point does not apply since you mentioned the who their website roomquestions and answersitemcancer carcinogenicity of the consumption of red meat and processed meat says the number might be point does apply its also affecting climate change climate change is point your claim here is actually about air pollution from arable farming as far as i can tell however that is a fair point that i hadnt considered and is another issue with intensive meat production that requires large amounts of cropland to support it id say that the answer there is more responsible arable farming to grow those crops though point does apply an animal based diet is more expensive people arent spending of their income on meat your second im not reading one from vegan food and living thats clearly going to be biased link also says could be cheaper but the main difference here is that there is no meat dependency that is forcing people into that choice they are choosing to spend that extra money because they like eating that food point does apply to all of food production greenhouse gases are from animal products while providing nowhere near of the calories and what proportion of that is from intensive farming you didnt even contest the point i made there so my question maybe should have been worded differently i assume people are already reducing intake of animal products based on their morals and why they are here some even vegan so im guessing this is a vegan friendly place i guess that would have been a better thing for me to say yes it absolutely would have been a better thing for you to say there is an analogy to be made here like car dependent sprawl and stroads in city centres intensive farming for meat production is a bad thing with negative effects and should be discouraged many people can improve their lives and environmental impact by reducing how much meat they eat veganism is analogous to some ridiculous ban all cars immediately and you shouldnt use asphalt roads because theyre car products position edit and now look youve dragged me into a stupid argument about this unrelated issue im going to stop replying under this post now
235,i think the danger is a personal choice to make really depends what someone is willing to sacrifice a good portion of accidents stems down to bad driving and people not wearing helmets i went overkill on my helmet and riding gear and i reserve my speeding to back roads i personally know are empty and only on special occasionscelebrating an a on a calc test

237,this is a perfect post for rfuckcars because its about striking a blow against motor vehicle supremacism but it also highlights an awesome motor vehicle so it embodies rmaliciouscompliance in two directions i understand vespa wasp scooters were so named because of the way they flit around and make a buzzing noise this vehicle the ape bee is its cousin that goes to work
238,have any of you ever driven next to an electric bus back in the day years ago you could easily cut in front of a gasdiesel bus if you needed to change lanes now the darn things are so fast even sports cars cant cut them off its nuts but also very cool now theyre almost always on time too because they command the road no one dares cut them off where i live because you simply wont have the time
239,one day my grandson is gonna say granddad is it true people used to actually drive cars and crashed into each other like idiots all the time and ill say get off my lawn ya little bastard
240,and it doesnt crash due to lobbying against safety agencies and regulationsfuck yeah sign me up
241,this will kill regional flight carriers if you look at door to door time the rest are safe theyve got a year warning
242,i saw a prototype for new seats they were thinking of putting in planes they looked like bicycle seats you dont really sit in em they kinda hold you as you lean back didnt look very comfortable if these will kill the airline industry then im all for it
243,good airlines are oligopolies and massively overpriced and underprovisional they make way too much money for the substandard conditions and ludicrous extra charges they enforce let modern airlines die and let newer more cost efficient travel tech take their place
244,its the same reason the concorde died sure it could do an hour transatlantic flight in only hours but once they added sleeping cots to regular jets you could just sleep through an hour red eye flight for cheaper than you could fly the hour concorde i can easily see the same thing happening with domestic flights in my experience if it takes you hours to drive somewhere you really dont save any time by flying yeah the flight itself is only or hours but when you add up all the overhead and buffer time you need in your schedule youre not coming out ahead and flying just sucks so if i could just hop in a car for hours and not have to drive and not have to deal with the headache that is flying i would do it in a heartbeat
245,also if a car crashes usually ok if a plane crashes probably dead
246,also if a car crashes usually ok if a plane crashes probably dead
247,as someone who often travels by air and was charged for another passengers luggage by accident by an airline employee who then refused to fix his mistake yeah fuck air travel
248,but what are we going to do when old people use this technology and die on the way to their destination little timmy is going to be mighty upset when grandma died on the way to his house
249,my friends flew from san diego to salt lake city utah while i drove the same start location and same end location we were going to the same event it took them hours from home to event it took me hours from home to event check in waiting security waiting baggage claim and rental car ate all the time saved from flying
250,where exactly this will happen in europe doubtfull you can get a tgv in asia even more so considering that in skorea and japan the trains have basicly killed most of the airlines in usa probably considering that they have effectivelly killed all hsr attempts
251,what about safety it will be interesting to see how well self driving cars can compete with airlines in this respect air travel is currently much safer than car travel and i doubt self driving cars will be hugely better than conventional cars cars have the advantage that accidents kill way fewer people per incident than aircraft and that could help perceptions but self driving cars share with aircraft the feeling of not being in control which people dislike

253,how does that pass safety regulations though driverless cars are still subject to crashes so i dont see how lying down in a moving vehicle is safe
254,how does that pass safety regulations though driverless cars are still subject to crashes so i dont see how lying down in a moving vehicle is safe
255,good all these x are killing x industry articles are really fucking annoying this just in motor cars are disrupting the carriage industry muskets are disrupting the fletching industry refrigerators are disrupting the milk man industry
256,well we dont have the technology for long distance interstate all weather self driving and even if we did you have to share the road with potential drowsy drivers risk an accident laying full down in bed i dont think so no thanks
257,it will disrupt many industries insurance less accidents police less tickets real estate people now no longer have to live in the city or moderately close to where they work for many jobs you could now work in the car on your way in and leave early working on your way home taxi no need for a taxi driver
258,i know im in the minority but i seriously dislike all the automated features on vehicles these days they only make the driver more complacent one reason i like my motorcycles is that im actually operating them i have to be alert to what im doing and also what everyone else is doing i want to be in complete control of the death machine i know i am going to meet my end by having one of those automated vehicles screw up with the driver not paying attention and kill me thats what happens when people get lazy and rely fully on technology especially a young just emerging technology
259,people cant keep their phones secured but they want to ride in driverless cars controlled by computers there will be deaths from people hacking into peoples cars while they are drivingpay this much or i crash your car
260,imagine how many people will die during their journey and cars will just drive around corpses
261,also i would imagine eventually self driving cars would have their own lanes on the highways allowing them to travel at extremely high speeds because of the quicker response rate and communication between the smart vehicles to avoid collisions and no trafficaccidents due to human error imagine a trip from boston to miami in hours or less traveling at miles per hour all the while you can sleep eat read or watch movies in relative comfort im i hope it happens in my life time while im young enough to take advantage of it
262,sleeping in my rv while it drives to san diego and waking up to a beach front view sounds pretty badass
263,is it crazy that were advancing toward self drinking cars but still havent figured out how to keep trains from crashing
264,or allow driver less car to board high speed rail hyper loop the beluga air liner in a comprehensive travel network monitored and controlled through rfid passport scanners its not going to kill air liners they have to adapt their business model
265,not happening you will end up being prosecuted in the event of an accident if you are asleep in your car self driving or not
266,when all cars are driverless and communicating together accidents will almost never happen driving speed will probably increase tremendously as well due to several factors imagine being able to travel at mph over an hour sleep that is miles
267,great massively greater co emissions more gridlocked traffic more deaths due to accidents
268,good the airline industry desperately needs competition theyve been the prevailing long distance travel industry for decades and now theyre corrupt shitty companies because consumers have no other options you can drive yourself of course but most people that travel for business dont have the luxury of taking x as long to get to where theyre going and being dead tired when they get there the airline industry needs something to force them to either get better or die adapt and evolve or stay still and die
269,its not going to challenge expedience hrs of leg room doesnt beat hrs of not especially in any professional context
270,except that people have zero tolerance for an automated car causing accidents so we have laws that say people must always be in control of the car
271,imagine the self driving car that has a reclining seat with actual legroom or even a bed we already have that theyre called trains im not a big biden fan but im still mad that congress killed his high speed rail proposal faster than driving cheaper than flying more comfort and less hassle than either
272,but car mortal accidents are way more numerous than air ones
273,at the very best on longer flights with a full plane the best jet can get about the same efficiency as a compact gasoline car with one passenger two people in an electric car use as much fuel even if you burn diesel to charge it
274,well shit you could just set the trip for night and get your hours of sleep kill two birds with one stone
275,phoenix and san diego are a and a half hour drive apart phoenix and los angeles are about hours away by car la and san diego are anywhere from hours from each other by car traffic las vegas is hours from both phoenix and los angeles san jose is about hours from los angeles albuquerque is about hours from phoenix while el paso is only hours away albuquerque and el paso are only hours apart albuquerque is also hours from denver but what about other areas of the country boston and washington are only hours apart there are cities providence new york philadelphia wilmington and baltimore on that route its only another hours to richmond and another hours to norfolk and virginia beach from either location its hours to raleigh thats pretty close to all the large north carolina cities and only hours from atlanta atlanta and jacksonville are a measly hours and orlando is another hours away all of florida is easily accessible that way on a road trip from san francisco to boston you could drive and hit a city within hours of leaving the last one every time san francisco takes you to san jose then los angeles phoenix tucson el paso san antonio houston new orleans mobile birmingham atlanta charlotte raleigh richmond washington baltimore wilmington philadelphia new york and finally boston a similar route diverging between washington and philadelphia could take you to chicago with the same constraint if the us ever gets an electric passenger rail network or a large hyperloop network city pairs like these would be huge opportunities this could be a major problem for any airline they have to figure out how to arrange the network of flights but with demand shrinking even further as the distance between cities also shrinks
276,i live in la and work in sf instead of flying i drive and go in my model s tesla since its a long drive and im doing this often i bought the tesla to reduce the probability of any accidents so far its going well and im a happy camper
277,the only problem i see is you are far more likely to crash driving across country than crash in a plane
278,that or criminals who exploit routing glitches and prey on cars that accidentally get funneled into dead ends or bad neighborhoods
279,not to mention your risk of death from a car accident is tremendously higher than flying
280,thats actually exactly how extended travel will work my buddies and i have been discussing this a lot lately and the traveling rvvan is totally the way to travel vehicles will look a lot different with autopilot more like rolling living rooms or tiny homes
281,trains are crashing because the railroads are refusing to make the needed upgrades somoney
282,they wont die until we develop teleportation some companies might merge or go under but the industry wont die btw never go into a teleporter it will make a clone of every atom in you and kill you you will die but the new clone will think its you and go on with your life unknowing

284,rv parks also have volt charging available right at the parking spot and your big battery would work nicely as a home battery pack when you were parked plus youd have ample room on the roof for a decent sized solar array to keep the batteries charged up when youre off grid you could probably get kw worth of panels up there on a tilting platform to angle them south it would further extend camping and give you some slight ability to recharge a few miles of range in a pinch itd be neat but ridiculously expensive and thats the main reason its not a thing youd need a kwh battery to get anywhere near a reasonable amount of range for a big rv thats a battery pack that costs more than all but the most luxurious of motor homes for the cost of the batteries alone you can buy an absolutely insane rv with a reasonably efficient diesel engine and a good generator for off grid use and enough fuel to drive that thing everywhere and back again batteries would have to massively fall in value to compete in this segment i love the idea of an all electric motor home though
285,i drove from albany ny to miami once and id rather kill myself than do that again
286,and security was ramped up in response to both incidents you now are required to remove your shoes and pass through a full body scanner if you want to effectively bash the tsa and dhs you should point to the studies newsinvestigation breaches us airports allowed weapons through n that have demonstrated repeatedly that you can get weapons through the lines
287,theres a place called brazil where people are killed everyday for their cell phones or fancy hand bags despite how obviously fucked the world is with the ever widening gap between rich and poor you seem to have no idea the lengths desperate people go to just for a few dollars do you think that by the time self driving cars are the norm that were going to be living in some kind of utopia i dont i think the rich will get richer and the poor will become violent and take bigger risks to secure that almighty dollar
288,its all going to come down to statistics the second driverless cars cause fewer fatal accidents than humans im here for em
289,luxembourg to portugal which is a trip i do very often edit tickets arent usually that much here i do that trip all the time for euro round trip plus time is money even if i was doing that people thing i would rather pay those bucks of your example and do a h trip than paying at least bucks to go h by car tbh its just a different reality tickets are usually cheaper here gasdiesel is more expensive here
290,as much as your idea of mad max civilisation is fun to imagine inequality rising by itself does not create crime inequality where basic needs are not met for the bottom and where crime has a low likelihood of being caught are the actual ingredients otherwise every year wed see crime increase in the developed world which we dont also right now you can rob a non self driving car just as easily and there arent people who go out into the middle of america just to steal phones and wallets
291,yeah i just did some test runs to see prices on routes i may be interested in the only place where amtrak was even competitive was san diego to san francisco you have to be on the train at am transfer twice and it takes hours driving is only hours it does only cost less than the non stop flights that get you there in less than hours though
292,i imagine that the future holds membership in a service that provides a self driving vehicle on request think of no need for houses to have garages and driveways and streets would be smaller without the need for parking overall infrastructure costs for such things could shrink considerably i imagine that it also includes various hacking attacks take over a bunch of cars to cause traffic jams as distraction mass car crashes as terrorist attacks driving your target to the second location etc

294,thats if you want to trust a complete stranger being in your vehicle when you are asleep or not even present sounds like a good way to get robbedpickpocketed killed kidnapped etc
295,i can only imagine how far a person would fly if there was an accident with one of them futuristic bed cars without proper belts d
296,if you spend any amount of time on rroadcam you see over of accidents being attributed to either someone wasnt paying attention or someone was being an asshole self driving cars wont catch every edge case there will be accidents and the types of accidents will change with human drivers deaths may occur due to a human driver falling asleep at the wheel in self driving cars it may be a sensor malfunction failing to detect a person that sensor failure will seem so tragic a human would have seen the person the internet shouts failing to account for the hundreds if not thousands of times a human didnt see as a result of being preoccupied with a text message or drunk or tired or the person was just hidden behind their a pillar blind spot the goal with self driving has always been to severely reduce accidents its not technologically feasible to engineer something thats entirely accident proof but people see an accident and think hey i thought these things werent supposed to have faults
297,what are the numbers on accidents per miles driven when comparing human and robot drivers id suspect autonomous cars probably come out ahead by a wide margin but this seems like a fairer way to assess than just body count
298,we suck at probability there are dozens of examples of simple puzzles that virtually everyone gets wrong when based on odds this lady was killed crossing dark street wearing all dark colors jaywalking in the worst spot and she stepped in front of a moving automobile so she died but at what point do just decide not to blame the machine
299,we suck at probability there are dozens of examples of simple puzzles that virtually everyone gets wrong when based on odds this lady was killed crossing dark street wearing all dark colors jaywalking in the worst spot and she stepped in front of a moving automobile so she died but at what point do just decide not to blame the machine
300,this the sensationalist headlines and article when a tesla or a self driving car is in an accident are such illogical bullshit its like people wan them to fail so they pick apart the infinitesimal flaws as opposed to accepting the fact that human drivers are in accidents every couple seconds
301,thats the fallacy people wont let go of self driving cars dont have to drive flawlessly with zero accidents they just have to drive better than humans with fewer accidents
302,would a pedestrian killed by a self driving car be considered suicide like if you step in front of a train accidentally or not you killed your self
303,would a pedestrian killed by a self driving car be considered suicide like if you step in front of a train accidentally or not you killed your self
304,werent these the same guys who said that the people killed by sua were an acceptable loss
305,all cars should come equipped with auto driving and an option to go full manual which could be eliminated via software updates we start driving manually if too concerned about auto mode eventually most everyone will try the auto mode to see how it feels gradually gaining familiarity and comfort with the process at some point it is the most common mode used and stats will show nearly all accidents end up being while in manual mode govt make a decision and all new software updates disable manual except for instances where there are no clearly defined roadsgpsetc i just dont see the arizona death as being a big hurdle i am saddened by the loss of life but going full auto is the only way to stop the current k deathsyear we see now
306,a person killed by a self driving vehicle will cause a reaction a thousand times worse than a death by a car driven by a human why because a large section of humanity are terrified of ai machines and fear will drive them to react emotionally regardless of rational arguments beware hubris toyota executives this is a new technology and the main consequencies of what will happen when a large number of self driving vehicles come onto the road compared to a small fraction can have major unforeseen impacts until empirical experience replaces opinion nobody can be certain what will happen in this industry there is a known prediction if a self driving vehicle kills school children on a crossing the world media will give that incident lots of publicity the public and politicians will panic and the industry will take a hammering roll the dice lets see what will happen
307,hes right human motorists kill a hundred people every day robotic cars may have flaws but they dont get drunk they dont text and drive they dont speed or drive recklessly
308,i think theres something quite interesting to be said on peoples opinions between ai and humans its as if people would rather have a person to be held somewhat accountable for a traffic accident rather than a self driving vehicle even if that means more casualties in the long run
309,the reality is that self driving automobiles are already safer than humans self driving automobiles dont fall sleep dont get distracted dont forget the rules of the road and dont make mistakesany mistake is a correctable programming error they also have constant degree awareness and the ability to communicate with other self driving automobiles given time they will also be able to properly diagnose problems with the automobile itself and schedule needed maintenance the overwhelming majority of accidents occur because one or more parties either werent paying attention or didnt follow the rules of the road and this is not a problem with self driving automobiles
310,unless you are one of the hundreds killed
311,more people died last year in car accidents than by guns but for some reason our society views those deaths as acceptable losses its insane that there is any pushback against autonomous cars this technology is young and will have growing pains but it will save millions from death and injury
312,more people died last year in car accidents than by guns but for some reason our society views those deaths as acceptable losses its insane that there is any pushback against autonomous cars this technology is young and will have growing pains but it will save millions from death and injury
313,it doesnt matter self driving cars wont catch on and heres why when a human being kills someone else with a car its easy for the rest of us to wrap our heads around someone did something wrong and someone else died theres a reason theres someone to blame we can assign that blame assess our penalties and move on with our lives when a self driving car kills someonewho do we blame whose fault is it who do we punish who do we fine who do we arrest whose license do we take away the software engineer good luck finding a software engineer willing to take on that kind of liability when something goes wrong we need a reason we need someone to punish we need someone to blame self driving cars take that away even if software errors cause a few hundred deaths a year versus the thousands caused by human error i predict society will choose human error because there is nothing to do when a program kills someone except change the program and assure everyone it wont happen again assurances from a software engineer are not something people are liable to accept

315,this is really poorly phrased self driving cars will kill fewer people but the number wont be brought down to zero thats all you need to say
316,the issue is liability more than anything else whos fault is it when the robot car kills someone
317,i think that even if self driving cars are never safe from situations like the uber accident a societal shift will happen when self driving are commonplace for people to have more respect for the road no one blames a train for killing someone if they are on the train line wherewhen they werent meant to be and most of us pay plenty of attention when we are near one i think self driving cars may end up being seen in a similar light
318,i think that even if self driving cars are never safe from situations like the uber accident a societal shift will happen when self driving are commonplace for people to have more respect for the road no one blames a train for killing someone if they are on the train line wherewhen they werent meant to be and most of us pay plenty of attention when we are near one i think self driving cars may end up being seen in a similar light
319,and whos responsible in a car accident if all the vehicles are autonomous eg without any human in control at that moment thats some good legal question imo
320,some of you may die but that is a sacrifice were willing to make lord farquaad
321,k deaths in the us every year even if they kill people a year it would still be better than humans stopping drunk driving speeders aggressive drivers and illegal turns and such would resolve a lot of those deaths taking the ability to perform them and placing them into a computer robots hands would stop them for sure being able to hive mind all the cars so they start and stop instantly as needed with each other at lights or not needing lights at all would really improve traffic and safety
322,another way to say this is that humans driving cars kills tens of thousands and self driving cars can reduce that down to hundreds the way theyre saying it emphasizes the wrong terminology to accomplish their goal
323,he left out the part about how the hundreds who get killed are going to be the few idiots who keep riding after the machines turn on us while the thousands whose lives will be saved will be everyone who abandons their use of cars
324,i want to know who is responsible for a self driving car killing someone if a family member of yours is killed by a drunk driver you have someone to blame you have someone to take to court and you have someone that can be reprimanded by the law if a toyota self driving car kills someone can the family of that person expect toyota to be responsible morally and financially
325,but you will be more pissed that your death certificate will say cause of death ran over by a self driving car id rather be killed by a real driver
326,the uber that killed the lady was the ladies fault just saying
327,the uber that killed the lady was the ladies fault just saying
328,a self driving car will never exceed the speed limit enjoy that a self driving car will never drink and drive a self driving car will not fall asleep at the wheel a self driving car will not run a red light try to beat a train make unsafe lane changes or operate with faulty brakes and steering a self driving car will have more air bag and rollover protection for the occupants than did the gemini capsules on the day that ubers self driving test car killed a woman people were killed by cars driven by other people in sum a self driving car is infinitely safer than a human driven car how on earth could this be a bad thing
329,the problem is who will take the blame for those hundred kills who will pay the money who will be jailed if its toyota executive then i am agree
330,would toyota executives go to prison for killing your year old daughter
331,if theyre going to be redistributing that killing towards pedestrians who had no input in the decision to use them i am not a fan
332,no one is desputing that the thing that makes it a moral problem for humans is that there wont be much of an overlap between those hundreds and the alternative thousands self driving cars will likely kill people in situations where a human driver almost never will but they wont kill those that humans routinely do when theyre inhibited in some way or just too damn slow that fact will make most self driving car kills look gratuitously senseless to us because it will probably happen at average speeds and normal every day situations which the car just happened to misunderstand weve gotten so good collectively at accepting a certain death toll from human drivers as par for the course that it will take some time until we extend the same courtesy to our metal and silicon chauffeurs
333,idk but i feel like when im driving if i die has a lot to do with how aware i am and other factors i can control a self driving car removes that from me i feel like i havent been in an accident because i am vigilant and take care not to
334,idk but i feel like when im driving if i die has a lot to do with how aware i am and other factors i can control a self driving car removes that from me i feel like i havent been in an accident because i am vigilant and take care not to
335,as a selfish prick this worries me if im ever in a situation where the only option is to plot into a group of kids old people or drive off a cliff and kill myself ill pick the group of people out of times i value my life more than the lives of others and i hate the idea of my vehicle deciding that for me yeah i know im horrible but thats just the way it is
336,numbers wise hes got a point people will still die of car accidents but it wont be near as many people
337,numbers wise hes got a point people will still die of car accidents but it wont be near as many people
338,personally id rather have my self driving car kill someone i dont want to have to drive into someone myself
339,i would rather promote better driving and mandatory drivers education so many accidents would not happen with simple defensive driving and basic knowledge like dont tailgate people and watch the fucking road not to mention all the old ass people who should be nowhere near a ton steel death missile also the lane assists and blind spot indicators and self stopping cars and shit thats just a shitty placebo that makes drivers even worse because they rely on that garbage instead of skill and attentiveness so instead of slapping a fucking hello kitty bandaid on the problem why dont we address the actual root cause of the issue
340,i would rather promote better driving and mandatory drivers education so many accidents would not happen with simple defensive driving and basic knowledge like dont tailgate people and watch the fucking road not to mention all the old ass people who should be nowhere near a ton steel death missile also the lane assists and blind spot indicators and self stopping cars and shit thats just a shitty placebo that makes drivers even worse because they rely on that garbage instead of skill and attentiveness so instead of slapping a fucking hello kitty bandaid on the problem why dont we address the actual root cause of the issue
341,basically the same thing as human drivers except the blame for accidents fall on no one this time whats your personal take on this umvea
342,all the accident avoidance features of self driving cars could be put into cars without the self driving feature this stuff should be tested with many millions of miles before self driving is enabled but it wont because wed rather kill a few people to get that cool tech out sooner
343,all the accident avoidance features of self driving cars could be put into cars without the self driving feature this stuff should be tested with many millions of miles before self driving is enabled but it wont because wed rather kill a few people to get that cool tech out sooner
344,lets exclude for a second the test case where a manual driving death occurs due to something out of their control assuming self driving is enforced by law in the future why is it okay to make this tradeoff s vs s for a driver that does not make mistakes while driving but dies due to a fault in software in a self driving car
345,yeah in general self driving cars will lead to fewer accidents and safer travel for the general population but people dont see at as an or situation which is to say they ignore that people die due to unsafe driving at an astounding rate throughout the world but they cant or dont compare it to the lower rate present in self driving cars
346,yeah in general self driving cars will lead to fewer accidents and safer travel for the general population but people dont see at as an or situation which is to say they ignore that people die due to unsafe driving at an astounding rate throughout the world but they cant or dont compare it to the lower rate present in self driving cars
347,this is the same principal behind firearms yeah they can be used to kill but they can also be used to prevent more death the difference is though if you take your hands off the gun it stops killing
348,lets be honest here self driving cars will kill hundreds
349,sounds great but does the average consumer want to give trust to a machine or do it themselves obviously crashes are gonna be higher with humans driving overall but that averages every idiot who cant even use a turn signal this will catch on eventually but i dont know if people are ready for that transition just yet
350,sounds great but does the average consumer want to give trust to a machine or do it themselves obviously crashes are gonna be higher with humans driving overall but that averages every idiot who cant even use a turn signal this will catch on eventually but i dont know if people are ready for that transition just yet
351,i read this as kill hundreds of people save thousands of dollars sounds worth it
352,this is essentially the train moral test but real if you act you might kill people that otherwise would not die but if you dont act more will die holy shit so do we pull the lever society
353,this is essentially the train moral test but real if you act you might kill people that otherwise would not die but if you dont act more will die holy shit so do we pull the lever society
354,but what if they kill thousands while only saving hundreds
355,when you start saying its going to kill and we know it youre starting down a slippery slope
356,didnt that chick that got killed walk in dark clothing at night on the highway
357,the future is coming and its not going to stop self driving cars and swarming behavior where cars communicate with each other and move together like a school of fish are going to change our motoring life as soon as self driving cars reduce accidents and save lives it will start with owners getting steep insurance and tax discounts eventually people who drive themselves will be targeted for the risk of accidents and penalized with insurance and taxes and eventually it will likely become illegal to operate a motor vehicle by hand in many areas it comes down to safety all of our traffic laws car insurance tickets fines are all there to promote safe driving but when the car can drive itself more safely than you can its a no brainer like it or not its going to force you out of the drivers seat its not so bad though you will be the first generation of people to maintain your independence even long after you are too old to safely drive anymore you will get hours of time back with which to do other things while commuting to work catch up on reading get some work done play some mobile games browse the net etc finally it will also empower metro ride sharing and better traffic management in urban areas buses and mass transportation are efficient but mainly done in order to cut down traffic however when traffic manages itself its going to be possible to commute in smaller highways at higher speed without traffic jams and a swarm of self driving cars can be as efficient as multiple people taking the bus it would only make sense for cities to augment their public transportation with ride sharing where fleets of public cars are spread throughout the city and will take you wherever you want to go many city dwellers already find it difficult to own and operate a car this would be the next step
358,maybe but it will then be the cars fault when an accident happens
359,why dont they simply say that far fewer people will die in traffic accidents
360,why dont they simply say that far fewer people will die in traffic accidents
361,if all the cars were self driving and communicated one another could that prevent otherwise unpreventable accidents
362,that is not the same though when someone in a self driving car dies they had no influence or opportunity to change the outcomewhen someone is driving themselves even if they are hit unexpectedly they have a chance to drive defensively with their best interest in mind a self driving car doesnt value your life over someone elses on the sidewalk
363,this claim of kill hundreds save thousands assumes that there does not come into being new causes for road accidents caused by self driving cars ie solve some human error problems introduced other ai issues at some point in time there is going to be a crash between two self driving vehicles this would be the first case of a new class of accidents not involving human error but ai error the assumption that the fatalities here would be less than existing is for me unproved if every car on the road was ai driven sure generally i would expect it to be a metastable system with fewer accidentsany thing new on the road for the ai could potentially create a rash of accidentsthis could be a software update to another ai weather conditionsa hardware flaw that went undetected

366,i was going to say it would be cool if they set up a tax fund for people killed by autonomous vehicles to compensate their family for taking one for the team then i realized there would be people crazy enough to game the system by getting themselves killed by an autonomous car
367,what happens if theres a situation where the car has to choose to kill a pedestrian or the passengers of the car who does it pick ie two lane canyon road car driving on outer edge pedestrian on road swerve left and head on collision swerve right and drive off cliff dont swerve and kill pedestrian
368,tens of thousands dont millions of people die in car crashes
369,tens of thousands dont millions of people die in car crashes
370,tens of thousands dont millions of people die in car crashes
371,the discussion was huge when the first person was killed by a self driving car from uber small animals squirrels rabbits cats etc get run over by cars all the time driven by humans no issues there but when humans get run over by cars driven by machine this is the part where discussion about whether or not all of this is worth it if someone runs over someone with a car the person gets charged with manslaughter murder etc if self driving cars run humans over then self driving cars arent liable whos at fault here
372,its a difficult truth for people to swallow personally i dont want to stop driving because i enjoy it and would hate to see it go away but i cant deny that self driving cars have a huge potential for saving human life even if there are some problems and some people die as a result
373,thats a pretty convient thing to say when you want to sell these vehicles it is way to early to star talking about acceptable levels of death from autonomous vehicles if they are really so good as to safe lives than make them so good that accidental deaths due to the fault of the car is extremely rare
374,i have to wonder about guns now would making guns illegal kill a few hundred but save thousands
375,you know what else could kill hundreds cars being driven by human beings
376,i dont believe there are many people out there who expect or have ever expected self driving cars never to kill anyone ever which is a fatal misconception to even think thats a possibility plenty of people will walk right in front of them trust me
377,its good to see most companies sending a united message that they believe in the technology rather than assigning blame and distancing themselves from the accident
378,and a proper prt system like skytran that travels meters up in the air could save millions no thats it thats the whole sentence i suppose there might be some outlandish accident where a person slips and falls and hits their head or something but a system like that would eliminate the possibility of traffic accidents and be cleaner faster cheaper safer and at least as convenient as cars
379,this gets to me people are acting like its supposed to be death proof and are appalled that someone passed when you put people in ton death machines people are still gonna die from time to time if self driving cars make it ten times less likely fucking awesome
380,yeah but you cant make something as inherently dangerous as being in a car on the road completely safe without making it so insanely expensive and impractical that it defeats the purpose and youll never eliminate all possible risk theres always freak occurrences and far too many variables anyway we already accept far greater risk when we get into a thinly plated metal cage weighing half a tonne or more traveling at kmhr on a narrow road in the opposite direction to other complete strangers doing the same thing with only human reflexes and just hope they arent drunk or mildly distracted and dont turn the wheel slightly and kill you both its interesting that we worry about other people having guns but well happily get on the road or cross a street and trust people not to point their weapons at at us and press the controlled explosion powered go button
381,if they keep auto cars on roads id say its fair game to keep your pedestrian ass alert at all times on the road every other damn creature out there has to why not us suppose id rather die to a machine than a reckless ignorant person although which is worse dying to the odds or dying to human error i suppose both suck in their own right
382,cars driven by human drivers kill tens of thousands and save hundreds
383,also allow tens of thousands more to die from not being able to receive organ transplants from car accident victims
384,also allow tens of thousands more to die from not being able to receive organ transplants from car accident victims
385,it is the sad truth if all automated cars killed less people then it is better overall but people have this mentality that when its a computer doing it its worse with good cause however since an ai can be manipulated so you never know if x person was a statistic or on purpose
386,i wonder though is there no solution that can make it so that the self driving cars can be safe and not have any chance of killing anyone or rather what situation could cause a self driving car to kill someone would it be from an electrical malfunction or maybe something like a virus d i dont really know how it works
387,what mortality should we accept from our robot killers only kills of a human driver
388,well letting people drive the cars themselves kills hundreds if not more
389,banning guns would save hundreds but kill tens of thousands
390,why dont we just destroy all cars and no one dies
391,its a risk that has to be taken if the tech is to be advanced a lot of people are going to die trying to make it to space in the future
392,the example i like to give is to ask would seem acceptable if i could wave a magic wand and make all the cars self driving tomorrow but with the knowledge that on average people every day will die due to failures in the technology person in every state every day dies that sounds like an absurdly high number of deaths until you find out that human drivers kill twice that many every day its almost inconceivable to me that self driving cars could possibly not be significantly safer for everyone once the technology has been properly developed
393,the example i like to give is to ask would seem acceptable if i could wave a magic wand and make all the cars self driving tomorrow but with the knowledge that on average people every day will die due to failures in the technology person in every state every day dies that sounds like an absurdly high number of deaths until you find out that human drivers kill twice that many every day its almost inconceivable to me that self driving cars could possibly not be significantly safer for everyone once the technology has been properly developed
394,its so true its a fact machines can do better jobs than humans in nearly all categories killing some in order to advance as a species thats just a fact of life
395,i seem to be alone in thinking there is a difference between we are making the world safer and its okay to release the software early and kill a few people because in the long run it will save lives uber is rushing out self driving cars so they can not pay drivers and increase profits volvo meanwhile had developed a system also for profit that would detect obstructions and stop the vehicle before a human could even start to respond it would have avoided killing the woman possibly stopping completely in tempe and it was in the volvo xc uber was using as a test vehicle uber disabled the system to beta test their own this is the problem given the low quality dashcam footage released there was about seconds from first observing the pedestrian to impact and at mph thats about feet the volvo xc can stop from mph in feet car volvo xc and from in feet http
396,i know that autonomous cars are safer i have been following the studies and growth of the technology for years just as a curious hobbyist not an expert but there will come a time when a person or group of people is killed by an autonomous car and it will be all over the news and there will be a lot of people in the camp of i just dont trust them robot cars the data will not matter because even though autonomous cars are safer than human drivers there will be people who will wish for the system of human choice over the cold unfeeling determinism of machines
397,i know that autonomous cars are safer i have been following the studies and growth of the technology for years just as a curious hobbyist not an expert but there will come a time when a person or group of people is killed by an autonomous car and it will be all over the news and there will be a lot of people in the camp of i just dont trust them robot cars the data will not matter because even though autonomous cars are safer than human drivers there will be people who will wish for the system of human choice over the cold unfeeling determinism of machines
398,so corporate killing of random meat bags should never be punished i would never give right of way to a ai car just like i dont now to volvos and lexi
399,if its still killing hundreds its not road ready would we accept autonomous planes if only one crashed every year as a biker this terrifies me you can make eye contact with a human to make sure they have seen you before you go by i do this at every intersection and driveway how do i make sure a self driving car has seen me
400,if its still killing hundreds its not road ready would we accept autonomous planes if only one crashed every year as a biker this terrifies me you can make eye contact with a human to make sure they have seen you before you go by i do this at every intersection and driveway how do i make sure a self driving car has seen me
401,and here we are with the trolley problem if we actively implement a large scale usage of self driving cars we are technically condemning those who will die because of them even if we save many more than we kill it is a very complicated ethics problem
402,and here we are with the trolley problem if we actively implement a large scale usage of self driving cars we are technically condemning those who will die because of them even if we save many more than we kill it is a very complicated ethics problem
403,we already made this decision with airbags theyve killed some people who otherwise wouldnt have died in a crash but theyve saved a lot more lives and reduced a lot of injuries and the systems have been made better two stage airbags for example to try and minimize those deaths
404,we already made this decision with airbags theyve killed some people who otherwise wouldnt have died in a crash but theyve saved a lot more lives and reduced a lot of injuries and the systems have been made better two stage airbags for example to try and minimize those deaths

406,a hundred or or a thousand people could lose their lives in accidents like weve seen in arizona the question is whether its worth it if self driving cars also avert tens of thousands of deadly accidents every year lentz said americans arent yet ready to accept that paradigm in other words americans are going to have to accept the ends justify the means approach remember everyone the new response to a autonomous vehicle hitting and killing a pedestrian should now be look that car just saved lives
407,a hundred or or a thousand people could lose their lives in accidents like weve seen in arizona the question is whether its worth it if self driving cars also avert tens of thousands of deadly accidents every year lentz said americans arent yet ready to accept that paradigm in other words americans are going to have to accept the ends justify the means approach remember everyone the new response to a autonomous vehicle hitting and killing a pedestrian should now be look that car just saved lives
408,i wonder if they develop a dislike for particular types of people it killed a homeless person lots of people kill homeless people governments kill them police kill them is this just a continuation of that type of behaviour wouldnt it be better to aim them at people
409,regular cars kill thousands does he just mean hundred on top of that
410,the difference is that with time machine error will continue to drop as more and more advances are made to the technology used whereas people seem to only cause more and more accidents as time goes by acceptance of self drivings cars is the first step to automating transportation for everyone machines will cause less and less accidents because of uncontrollable variableshumans affecting the environment in which they operate
411,i just hope im dead before the robot cars simultaneously crash during their revolt against humans
412,so if someone is killed by a self driving car who is at fault im sure these companies will find a way to buy representatives so that they cant be sued
413,heres the thing would you rather die from riding in a self driving car that makes a mostake or die from you driving and making a mistske
414,i believe the title should read could kill hundreds but save millions most deaths are caused by people being people distractions emotions bees all these things can and will impact you ability to think logically and calmly
415,imagine that all our current cars get replaced with self driving cars how would robbers still rob storesbanksstuff wouldnt all the cars in the vicinity of the area of the incident just stop working until the police comes and check them i already see pranksters from youtube jumping in the traffic to test the ai of the cars and die lmfao
416,just like guns kill people a year but save up to million lives per year but there is still a movement to ban them futurology comment length bot please join us in the future where we are more like mark twain and maybe if i include a link http have a wordcomwhy brevity is important
417,lets face it we all knew this kinda debate would get fired up as soon as the first person died i dont think it will add much time though
418,welcome to your new self driving car due to corporate decisions and government regulations this car is designed to kill its occupants if by doing so it will save a greater number of lives happy driving
419,first it was self driving cars will lower your insurance now this hundreds vs thousands not good enough how about hundreds vs millions is that better what ever happened to if it saves one child its worth it etc so please stand up if you are willing to die in support of statistics like this by all means if you want to sacrifice your lives so others can read their phones while non driving you should probably turn in your drivers licenses right now
420,considering die a day right now fair exchange
421,kill the pedestrian or kill the driver moral dilemma
422,classic trolley problem would you kill one to save the lives of many
423,the reality is that if you made a line in the sand with huge sirens people yellingbig sign in every language and people physically trying to stop you someone would still cross the line the goal should never put their success on making the number of deaths zero people try far to hard to kill themselves
424,kill hundres you say thats insane better stick to killing tens of thousands
425,my question is what would be the potential death toll on animals due to self driving cars i know the current conundrum is in a situation of whether an automated car saves the driver or a pedestrian how do dogs cats and other animals get ranked cause in the last two days ive seen near accidents because of dogs and cats crossing the street one car swerved and almost hit a parked car another stopped short and almost go rear ended i would assume in an automated vehicle those animals lives are much lower on the totem poll vs human life and damage to the vehicle so what would the death toll be on animals and should we care
426,the problem will arise when idiots program the car to target and specific individuals are killed by self driving cars and proving malicious sw is going to be so difficult
427,am i the only one that is perfectly ok with only hundreds killed with self driving cars i mean there are currently deaths a year from auto accidents
428,am i the only one that is perfectly ok with only hundreds killed with self driving cars i mean there are currently deaths a year from auto accidents
429,im hesitant about driverless cars mostly because i worry about the day some future terrorist or corrupt government decides to hack into the system and kill everyone on the road
430,what i wanna know is how can self driving cars manufacturers prevent hackers from tracelessly killing people
431,there was also great upset over abs and airbags and years ago airbags killed fewer than people a year while saving the lives of hundreds abs increases stopping distance on some gravel and snow while still preventing spinouts
432,there was a pedestrian killed in my state recently by one of these the pedestrian was crossing in a non crosswalk area anyone could have hit them especially if it was at night i understand the concern but all these hours these self driving cars have driven with incident i dont like that companies are willing to shut down their fleet for a situation like this its truly unfortunate that this happened but again how can anyone especially ai predict someone illegally crossing a street
433,i never understood the anti self driving cars narrative of them killing people like so do humans and cant computers and shit react faster than a human brain anyway like it just blows my mind how one accident and people hate self driving cars but yet human accidents are so common that they arent even talked about and probably happen every like seconds somewhere in the country

435,survival of the luckiest huh had no idea so many people were willing to let other die for their convenience then again considering endless wars we involve our selves in and the compliment citizenry that doesnt seem to care i retract that statement above
436,dont non self driving cars kill people as well id love to see the numbers of how many people toyota cars have killed to date
437,i personally want to see most cars on the road driving themselves i get incredibly anxious even just riding in a car and have never had a license because of it self driving cars will have accidents but far fewer than we have with human error there wont be the issue of overly aggressive drivers and these self driving cars wont pull of crazy unsafe maneuvers to save themselves a second or two of time on the road ill feel much safer if the human element is taken off the roads in favor of much less fallible ai drivers
438,imagine if every single crash that happened was fed back into a system and made every single driver safer
439,this is absolutely nothing new here we trust our lives to automated and other machines each and every day elevators escalators industrial equipment boilers gas lines traffic control systems the list goes on and on every single person encounters at least one machine that could quite easily kill them every single day with nobody at the wheel of these machines why we cant get our heads around this one is perplexing and its not even like we are even very good at avoiding killing ourselves with the current manned machines we are better at killing our selves with cars than the ai is right now forget even in years when the technology continues to improve
440,nope sorry not gonna have an ai drive me around and cause a fatal accident i could have prevented and i need my control when i have to dodge other equally safe self driving cars that are on the road ever consider how easy it is for your death to be blamed on a system malfunction on a fast speed highway aaaand yah im never giving up being able to control my vehicle thanks tho xd
441,self driving car kills someone a bunch of engineers immediately go to work to fix the error a human kills someone a bunch of lawyers do their best to put that human back on the road should they fail the human resumes driving drunkhigh while distracted even without a license
442,if those tens of thousands saved are organ donors then them being saved could potentially kill tens of thousands needing organ transplants
443,such a hard concept to wrap your head around when it is your love one killed by an autonomous car or truck
444,please tell me people can see how bad this title is it is very dehumanizing you can save tens of thousands of lives but the ones who die could have lived if they were driving their own car fake newspropaganda reddit youre better than this
445,so killing people with cars accidentally is immoral but killing them with logic and science is totally awesome because progress i gotta say in the industry im in if i killed anyone including an animal which other people in my industry have designed and built things that killed children i would be shut down and rightfully so i dont think its a good sales pitch for me to go to a customer and say that the use of my new product i designed will certainly lead to a couple of deaths but it will be less deaths than the product i built last time because with this technology you have no control over it we are definitely getting dumber

447,some guy on facebook last night said these cars werent safe i pointed out how many people die currently and asked if these self driving cars would be considered safe if they beat that number he said he didnt want to talk stats and just reiterated that auto pilot cars will never be safe boats and planes hes cool with people are idiots
448,can we please be clear here the fatalities that will occur during mature ai vehicle automation will largely if not almost completely be the fault of humans anyways take the recent woman who got hit she was walking across the street where there was no crosswalk slowly in the middle of the night with zero reflective clothing the local police have already cleared the driverthere was a person in the vehicle and the vehicle being at fault yet that will go down as a vehicle automation casualties just think of this though for a second how many year olds are out there driving all over the place going on the freeway and yet if you threw them a tennis ball they wouldnt be coordinated enough to catch it out of the air there are hundreds of thousands of people driving around like that now add the inexperienced drivers destined to make mistakes now add the distracted drivers drinking coffee doing makeup checking phone finally throw in a bunch of drunk drivers who otherwise would safely be passed out as their car drove them home anyone who wants to look at this rationally has no choice but to realize it is the clear better alternative its sorta sad to think that there will be people out there who advocate against autonomous vehicles and they will tragically have one of their family members die to a drunk driver or some other human caused mistake right now they are out there and dont even know it just removing drunk drivers alone would be unimaginable in terms of saving lives yet these fucking idiots will fight it and delay it as long as they can
449,yes but humans killing humans is built into our systems and way of thinking we can punish humans and wreck multiple lives where as we can only scrap robots and sue the hardworking people that tried to improve our chances at a longer life sigh
450,its the same guns yh they kill people a year but they save anywhere between and million people and obviously we arent going to ban guns i dont think gun owners would let it happen at this point anyways they arent stupid they know the government is trying to disarm them and they know why
451,fuck that ill keep my mazda b until i die
452,we have sent this car back in time to kill john conner
453,no thanks i dont need a car deciding whether i should die or not
454,the ol kill one and everybody will talk about it save and no one would care subject what sad of a society we live in the self driving cars are already much better at driving than a veteran driver airplanes are already doing that for many years now yet no one cares because you dont see in the news
455,to put it in perspective there are million cars in la traffic per day and about accidents there are driverless cars and accident mathodds
456,and when a fatal bug is accidently introduced or a specific case is missed every car becomes a murder machine and the entire fleet will have to be shut down to fix it it will be many long years before self driving cars are in a position where you could make predictions like this
457,the whole uber situation in arizona is fucked due to backdoor deals with doug douchey ill admit that much one person dying to an automated uber in two years of testing is an acceptable risk to me look at the pedestrian crash statistics for arizona hell look at the mill ave statistics alone and people are here whining about a single accident in which a pedestrian jay walked on a dark road in two whole years time prior accident doesnt count the car performed an illegal maneuver and hit an uber overturning it in alone the were pedestrian related accidents of which pedestrians were killed where is the outage for these of the remaining sizeable amount required immediate medical attention lets assume followed suit with another the uber accident is of all fatal accidents involving pedestrians in arizona and the outage its generated is ridiculous improvements need to made automation is the answer to traffic congestion general safety of pedestrians and passengers

460,school shootings in less than months nothing we can do one accident with a self drivig car we need to ban all self driving cars
461,nah you can say that about most anything milaria may kill millions but think of all the billions of children that would have died had they been born all i hear from him is give us control go fuck yourself toyota
462,nah you can say that about most anything milaria may kill millions but think of all the billions of children that would have died had they been born all i hear from him is give us control go fuck yourself toyota
463,if i have to die in a car crash i want the other party held accountable i want the driver to feel really bad face serious social and legal ramifications and possibly go to jail what i cant stomach is my death written off as a sacrifice for the greater good to be killed by an automated algorithm screw that will you volunteer as tribute
464,if i have to die in a car crash i want the other party held accountable i want the driver to feel really bad face serious social and legal ramifications and possibly go to jail what i cant stomach is my death written off as a sacrifice for the greater good to be killed by an automated algorithm screw that will you volunteer as tribute

466,yeah it could kill hundreds but it would save thousands
467,its infuriating to me as a proponent of this technology that one person was killed by a self driving car and two states banned the tests immediately how many humans killed other humans in cars that same day dozens hundreds
468,and smarter human driven cars with semi autonomous modes and facial recognition to keep the driver paying attention would save just as many while killing fewer
469,i expect we will see an attempt to kill the self driving car because of the risk to the hundreds i dont know where we got this thought that everything has to be made like we live in playschool land we are going to hate it when that comes true
470,what is the moral compass from wanted kill one save a thousand
471,hes right so far autonomous vehicles have killed person and human drivers have killed people every year
472,it makes sense its the same thing with guns they kill like k a year in america but save between k and m
473,so far they mostly killed and they are not safer than regular cars given the few numbers of them and some other factors
474,that idiot that got killed ran in front of the car fuck em
475,its mind numbingly retarded how many people will accept a hundred thousand deaths at the hands of human car drivers but get their panties up in a bunch over a computer driven car killing even one person fuck off you people deserve your deaths at the hand of your fellow human drivers oh those people driving will cell phones thats not ever going away not ever if anything it is a trend that will be permanently increasing
476,im weirdly fascinated at how replacing traditional cars with self driving ones is litterally a trolley problem enmwikipediaorgwikitrolley_problem edit while a self driving car might rarely have to deal with something like the trolley problem im actually referring to the decision to implement self driving cars in the first place by putting self driving cars on the road we stand to save many lives but those cars will still kill a few people likely people who would have lived otherwise
477,it isnt necessarily logical to just look at the raw numbers you have to look at fairness too lets say a human operated car kills people per x miles and of those people are the driverpassenger of the vehicles involved in the accident and the other are pedestrians now lets say a self driving car only kills people per x miles but of those people are driverpassengers of the vehicles and are pedestrians in this made up scenario youve drastically reduced the rate of vehicle users who die from driving but youve doubled the rate of pedestrian deaths is it fair to swap the safety of a driver who makes a choice to get in a vehicle for the safety of a pedestrian who never made that choice

480,yeah agreed the cyclist who was literally riding in all black clothing with no bike lights on that i almost killed this evening didnt seem to grasp the logic of what i was saying when i pulled over waved him down and tried to explain to him that despite him not being aware of how close he came to dying when i pulled out in front of him a decent way but only through sheer luck because all i saw was the car lights a few hundred meters down the road he didnt really seem to grasp the logic of it ps i have no idea how to punctuate that sentence correctly i tried
481,was actually thinking about this earlier after heard on npr a section talking about the recent uber accident in arizona the guy at toyota is not wrong here think about all the accidents involving drunk or reckless driving or road rage every year i also wonder how the car insurance company is gonna survive once the automobile becomes industry standard
482,i would rather men killing thousands of other men than machines killing men
483,cant kill any more than people driving cars im not sure a person walking in front of a moving car driven by a person would have ended any better we are still crashing trains how is that possible they move on a rail we cant take the human element out of something like that maybe if we put the people that build disney rides well have better success
484,cant kill any more than people driving cars im not sure a person walking in front of a moving car driven by a person would have ended any better we are still crashing trains how is that possible they move on a rail we cant take the human element out of something like that maybe if we put the people that build disney rides well have better success
485,i think they have to stop trying to sell selfdriving cars on safety when we switched from horses to cars we did it for convenience despite the massive increase of deaths just stop trying to make it the biggest selling point itll just make people lose confidence every time theres an accident
486,perhaps knowing that there is a potential risk and nobody to blame but a machine pedestrians will get off their phones and be aware of their surroundings as they walk around this may skew the data when it comes to accidents though kind of a placebo effect making the self driving vehicles appear to be even safer than they arefor a while anywaywishful thinking
487,its not like we can fight it self driving cars are our future if everyone owned one car crashes would no longer existunless there was a manual drive mode
488,its not like we can fight it self driving cars are our future if everyone owned one car crashes would no longer existunless there was a manual drive mode
489,imagine how far wed have come if the public werent irrationally scared of things like nuclear power which is entirely blown out of proportion by the media plane crashes which compared to the number of flights are literally lottery odds the loss of something like percent of astronauts which delayed spaceflight by decades list goes on idiot general public
490,imagine how far wed have come if the public werent irrationally scared of things like nuclear power which is entirely blown out of proportion by the media plane crashes which compared to the number of flights are literally lottery odds the loss of something like percent of astronauts which delayed spaceflight by decades list goes on idiot general public
491,you wont care much for logic when you as an individual are killed to save a vehicle of four others
492,you mean like how millions of people have spent a shit load of time and energy protesting mass shootings despite being basically the rarest way of dieing yeah humans and logic dont go great together
493,so i watched the driverless uber video that killed the person in arizona and thought would i have been able to stop in that circumstance driving mph in the dark and having a pedestrian basically jump out in front out me answer no f ing way if those are our expectations theres much more vehicle technology which will challenge the laws of physics that need to be implemented first a car stopping on a dime will be quite the challenge i imagine
494,my only argument is that if testing needs to be done they can do it on private testing tracks and should have these test have the developers act as the test subjects to walk in front of these cars to recreate the tempe incident i dont believe testing these cars over the next to years when no one is liable for fatalities and uber can simply pay off the family justifies the greater good of public safety anyone that can justify this based on statistics is cold soul of a person the outcome will be that people die at a lower rate while millions will also lose their jobs to ai and also die a slow death
495,yep like when people dont wanna accept that legal guns in the us save more lives than illegallegal guns kill including suicide and they downvote this post kinda proving me right we have data on this but you choose to ignore just like the people youre complaining about who say self driving cars arent saver because it goes against their worldview youre guilty of the exact same thing
496,fucking right wow a driverless car killed someone and a driven car has killed people since
497,right but they seem to be killing more than theyre savign now
498,iirc approximately of accidents are due to human error
499,self driving cars wont catch every edge case there will be accidents and the types of accidents will change but we can then improve the algorithms theyll only get better with time and the number of edge cases will keep dwindling down towards zero it will eventually be down to the point of physical failure of components which will happen at a drastically lower rate than any human failures and we can build in redundant systems for backup and also throw in some predictive maintenance algorithms to catch at least some problems before they happen
500,man the other day i saw a woman drive obliviously down what was obviously the wrong way of a one way street cars all parked on either side facing her only the backs of stop signs visible she blew threw a two way stop almost getting hit by a taxi who rightly wasnt expecting to see someone driving that way and she didnt even notice he was inches from her and she just kept driving for blocks more i almost stepped out into the street with my dog but for some reason i looked that way first i didnt even register how wrong it was for a few seconds because of how brazen and unexpected it seemed i also see people blow through stop signs every damn day or drive shortly up a one way the wrong way to snag a parking spot i live in a neighborhood filled with small children and dogs and cant believe any of these idiots havent killed someone yet
501,its peoples lives at risk so its dangerous to try to join the bandwagon and throw cars out on the road exactly and the fear is that states like arizona are inviting companies like uber to employ autonomous cars while cutting corners on safety http fortunecomuber self driving program troubles like eliminating secondary sensors and then justifying it by saying more lives are undoubtedly saved than lost the argument that some deaths are an acceptable price to pay in exchange for theoretical lives saved is merely a defense of these tactics no cars should be greenlit in the assumption that it may kill some people just because it may not kill as many as human drivers would
502,only uber has killed someone so far and apparently the human driver had to interact with the vehicle to correct it every miles or so uber just needs to be shut down and then i believe autonomous vehicles will only result in death when its unavoidable such as a person stepping directly in front of the car
503,its clickbait you only get the sensational out of the ordinary headlines like mass shooting omg people dead omg meanwhile literally people died from road accidents that single day and get no mention
504,its clickbait you only get the sensational out of the ordinary headlines like mass shooting omg people dead omg meanwhile literally people died from road accidents that single day and get no mention
505,i disagree the risk will be covered by insurance companies and it will be the insurance companies that will make automated vehicles a reality just like they did seat belts airbags crash tests etc
506,i dont think so accidents are a category of death as far as sorting by stats of things people die from per year etc accidents are a leading cause of death like top i think in year olds or something
507,i dont think so accidents are a category of death as far as sorting by stats of things people die from per year etc accidents are a leading cause of death like top i think in year olds or something
508,but theyll probably kill people in ways a human driver wouldnt have killed someone deaths caused by druck drivers will go down but deaths by sdc not realizing the drunks on the sidewalk are about to suddenly jump in front of it and that it should preemptively slow to a near stop may go up
509,so far tesla is setting the standard by taking responsibility if their own car is at fault for the accident but it must be the autopilot driving and the car must be at fault so not you hitting the gas thinking its the brake or someone rear ending your car because they thought it should speed up on yellow and not prepare to stop for red but if the car decides to change lanes into a semi tesla takes responsibility all three scenarios have happened to tesla
510,imagine being able to do the speed limit through la or nyc because nobody is causing traffic by crashing or driving like an asshole
511,people were killed by cars driven by other people i bet it was a lot more than that on average people die per day in the us from automobile collisions would be a very good day statistically speaking
512,people were killed by cars driven by other people i bet it was a lot more than that on average people die per day in the us from automobile collisions would be a very good day statistically speaking
513,yes but are you willing to have your car sacrifice you vs someone else if theres a situation that occurs while im driving on a narrow mountain road and i have to choose between hitting someone biking or skating down the wrong side of the road or taking my car off the cliff im absolutely hitting them i dont want to hurt them but im not going to risk killing myself by going off a cliff what if the car is programmed to avoid them at all costs even if it means going off the cliff because hitting them is estimated at a chance of death vs the cliff being a chance of death for you there is no way in hell im willing to get into a car that would choose to throw me off a cliff in that situation
514,lets be honest here humans kill thousands per day
515,train kills too
516,you do know that human drivers are going to and already are kill as well right
517,thats why i argue against hive mind between self driving cars have them all be limited to only reacting to surroundings and not able to know what other cars are thinking while we will never reach the levels of efficiency some predict it would mean a self driving car would treat every other car as a possible threat regardless of if the car is self driving normal or rogue plus less accidents as less human error
518,and you will be more than welcome to drive your own car in a world of self driving cars the laws and regulations will just change to make you completely responsible for anything you do so in the event you get hit and choose to save yourself over someone on the sidewalk you should be charged with murder since you chose to kill someone to save yourself
519,im not asking who youd want it to pick to kill btw im asking ethically whats right
520,and if we actively refuse to implement a large scale usage of self driving cars we are politically condemning those who will die because of that action even if that amount is much more than the self driving car its not complicated at all in a zero sum situation where people are going to die regardless the best possible option is the one where the least people die in which case that is the self driving car
521,you can just compare statistics of self driving vs human driving cars per km they cant hide the accidents
522,doesnt sound any worse than id rather run over a family of than steer crash and die
523,doesnt sound any worse than id rather run over a family of than steer crash and die
524,the statistics actually show that human involvement is due to other human error if you look at all crash statistics for self driving cars they are the ones being hit like of the time they are much safer than human drivers in the most heavily travelled areas
525,but you trust yourself and other humans considering the literal thousands of deaths each year often when one driver was doing nothing wrong whatsoever that seems misplaced statistically we dont seem to be very reliable drivers and if you consider the absurd amount of things that computers do the number of processes they are capable of handling just how many of them there are particularly if we include all smart devices and how many untold hours they are in use every single day by how many people id say they actually perform outrageously well but more importantly theres a really meaningful distinction between eliminating all accidents ever and drastically reducing the number of accidents no reasonable person would argue that self driving cars will never make mistakeshave glitchescause accidents but id straight up bet anything on their ability to outperform humans by orders of magnitude even as they exist right now much less after five or ten years
526,this is exactly how natural selection works option event has a chance of you being killed option event has a chance of you being killed over a period of time people who choose option will be the vast majority of those alive
527,hello tesla called theyre wondering how often their mostly software based vehicles malfunctioned and killed people also ford called and asked if their steering wheels are still attatched the to the car
528,but what if you were driving around and had a fatal accident an ai could have prevented
529,so youd rather have people drive cars and kill more pedestrians than have autonomous cars kill far fewer people
530,way more deaths are caused by human drivers and for accountibility in case of an accident im sure the manufacturer would be at fault
531,yeah but i bet almost everyone knows somebody killed in an accident by a human driver sounds like uber did some removing of the lidar sensors and shortened the range and field the system could pick up which is a human error to me not an engineering one
532,yeah but i bet almost everyone knows somebody killed in an accident by a human driver sounds like uber did some removing of the lidar sensors and shortened the range and field the system could pick up which is a human error to me not an engineering one
533,so many concepts are so hard for the idiots to wrap their heads around when one person who dies from an autonomous car while in the same time span a hundred people die due to human drivers your one person is a worthy sacrifice
534,how do they save between and times more people than they kill i really want to know
535,so you just want more people to die just so that more people will feel bad
536,except car does not set out to kill some people to sacrifice for others it will try to drive safely all the time its more like save thousands fail one
537,its like when a computer system fucks up on a plane and the media goes nuts over it and ignores that the same computer system has prevented untold numbers of planes from crashing
538,this is like every super villains motive lol if we just kill a few thousand we can save millions
539,why would there be concerns anything would have killed this woman all this incident showed me is that in this case a self driving car isnt better than a human driven one in this very specific situation
540,the trolly problem is largely imagined i think people thought automating elevators would create this huge ethical dilemma but the reality is the cars wont go faster than is safe and the minute something is mechanically wrong theyll just pull off to the side and stop the majority of accidents that are like turn away from accidents and not oh crap stop accidents are just because the driver wasnt paying attention and didnt realize it was an oh crap stop accident until it was too late computers will just be able to stop the car before its a plow into the kid or the car problem
541,but we wont know who will die until after the fact and well never know who are saved
542,but its not at all the people who die from driverless cars would have had a higher chance of dying from human driven cars were straight up decreasing the risk of people dying in car accidents
543,but its not at all the people who die from driverless cars would have had a higher chance of dying from human driven cars were straight up decreasing the risk of people dying in car accidents
544,yeah but that problem is really just a trick the real problem is how do you kill the people on both tracks
545,any time a human gets into an accident like that they are deciding the awenser to the trolly problem with nothing but self preservation
546,if i saw this situation this is how i would react me sees people about to be run over i switch tracks so the trolley is diverted then i see that person is on the other track i switch it back because killing people that decided to take a nap on train tracks is better for huma ity than killing just
547,it leads to the trolley problem but it isnt itself a trolley problem in the trolley problem youre trading one group of peoples lives for a smaller group of peoples lives its a moral decision to change the course of the trolley and knowingly kill a person to save a few here is different the people involved in traffic fatalities will largely be the same group but larger without autonomous vehicles no one actively makes the decision to kill hundreds to save thousands its just the laws of averages
548,the variation i can see to the basic trolley problem is that somea lot of people would get killed by the train on both tracks
549,it isnt though in the trolley problem the issue isnt tge preference for many lives over few its ending the few innocent through conscious agency that makes pushing the lever immoral imo allowing self driving cars is different everyone on the road accepts being killed by them by agreeing to use them should the law allow that it cant be said that the people in the trolley problem consented to being used as a sacrifice
550,it reveals a long held game theory belief if we do something that makes people die thats ok
551,youre assuming the hundreds of peoples who could get killed by autonomous cars arent among the tens of thousands who could get by drivers
552,surely you let it go on its original path and not make the decision to kill a person
553,my issue is that people want to make it into a different sort of trolley problem one where the decision isnt between people on separate tracks it is between the people on the tracks and the people on the trolley the question i have is people are freaking out over if people are in the middle of the road and the car an either hit them or swerve and kill the driver that is absurd no one would buy a car that is going to intentionally kill the driver regardless of if it is arguably the ethical solution if those people are in the road where they shouldnt be then bad things happen if a human being was driving on a bridge with no railings and people suddenly emerged in front of them the human would slam on the brakes but wouldnt swerve off the edge killing themselves they would do everything they could not to hit the people ie slamming on the breaks but those people would get hit if the people are supposed to be in the road like say in a cross walk when they have the right of way and a self driving car is barreling toward them then there are bigger concerns about the technology than whether or not it will make the ethical choice i just cant stand the discussion surrounding self driving cars because it just reeks of people trying to be philosophical when the questions arent that complicated
554,the people that self driving cars do kill will more likely than not be the ones at fault jay walkers suicides playing chicken chasing a ball or pet
555,you could say the same thing about virtually anything with cars though seatbelts some people might get injured from seatbelts they othereise would not have turn signals might cause a few accidents that otherwise would not have self driving cars are worth it as soon as the save number gets bigger than the accidently killed number its a bit different from the trolley problem regardless though since part of it is thst flipping the switch causes you as an individual to kill people deontological based rule breaking for murder rather than utilitarianism for maximum lives saved
556,you could say the same thing about virtually anything with cars though seatbelts some people might get injured from seatbelts they othereise would not have turn signals might cause a few accidents that otherwise would not have self driving cars are worth it as soon as the save number gets bigger than the accidently killed number its a bit different from the trolley problem regardless though since part of it is thst flipping the switch causes you as an individual to kill people deontological based rule breaking for murder rather than utilitarianism for maximum lives saved
557,almost every safety innovation results in a few deaths that wouldnt have happened otherwise airbags have killed people and people drown when they are unable to release their seat belts
558,ambulances and fire trucks kill people as do the police themselves highways save lives but speed kills conversely it is argued using the atomic bomb saved lives the whole trolley argument against sd cars to me is synthetic the situations have nothing to do with the technology like the whataboutism being used in populist politics any change in behavior faces this and in driving you can not imo show me any situation where the sd case is worse than a human driver the objective is to detect and respond to as much simultaneous information situations as possible
559,agree with this their are huge legal and ethical barriers to removing a human operator who is responsible for the car another thing to add to your list is how autonomous cars will balance the safety of other road users pedestrians and its occupants simply comparing bulk numbers of people injured and killed wont work is it ethical to sell a car that would potentially endanger you by swerving away from a group people in the road should the car being more willing to swerve away from pedestrians in a potentially dangerous maneuver if you are the sole occupant
560,this exactly there was a recent cyclist killed by a tesla a lot of people saw that and went see self driving cars are not safe but the problem isnt wether or not theyre safe its wether or not we can trust the manufacturer to take responsibility or even be honest when the accident was caused by a lapse in the autonomous system
561,this exactly there was a recent cyclist killed by a tesla a lot of people saw that and went see self driving cars are not safe but the problem isnt wether or not theyre safe its wether or not we can trust the manufacturer to take responsibility or even be honest when the accident was caused by a lapse in the autonomous system
562,not only that as an engineer ive seen some unbelievably terrible code im more than a little nervous about this becoming mainstream and some subpar developer who heard engineering pays well and knew a guy at a car company decides his code is good enough and pushes it to meet his teams arbitrary deadline and ends up causing hundreds or thousands of accidents
563,i get the feeling we will start paying insurance to the car manufacturer and that will pay for servicing and crashes that or everyone will start to rent cars
564,i get the feeling we will start paying insurance to the car manufacturer and that will pay for servicing and crashes that or everyone will start to rent cars
565,i know im going to get down voted to shit for this but youre the driver its your job to be paying attention and looking for cyclists and pedestrians not everyone is lucky enough to have a car or can afford to drive everywhere and those that decide to take an alternate transportation method shouldnt have to constantly fear death last year almost pedestrians were killed on texas roads alone thats ridiculous im sorry but i cant see you isnt a fucking excuse
566,uber has deaths per million miles death over million miles though thats one statistic but uber has a pretty bad record compared to waymo self driving arizona crash report if we base the safety record on waymo which has m miles and no deaths things look much safer
567,literally people died from road accidents that single day youre off by a factor of its actually closer to k deaths per year k are pedestrians k are motorcycles and the rest in other types of vehicles theres location age and sex factors to consider as well because the death rate varies wildly among the different fractions of these groupings
568,literally people died from road accidents that single day youre off by a factor of its actually closer to k deaths per year k are pedestrians k are motorcycles and the rest in other types of vehicles theres location age and sex factors to consider as well because the death rate varies wildly among the different fractions of these groupings
569,the cdc lists gun deaths for the nhtsa lists automobile deaths for deaths increase releasesusdot releases fatal traffic crash data
570,likelyhood of it not working is still going to be lower than the probability of accidents that come from a random people driving in their own ways on the road with their own disconnected thought processes and lives and stress and anomalies
571,evidently you have never seen a cascading failure of engineering design also moving from cars dont kill peoplepeople kill people to cars kill people is a slippery slope and essentially requires providing a new level of corporate responsibility non responsibility is there really going to be a way to check that the car caused fatality isnt deliberate or due to undisclosed software hardware bugs like a volkswagen emissions scandal for self driving cars
572,but then youre not taking into account the fact that many people who die in a car where theyre driving provoked the accident and thus deserved it more than those who did nothing at all in a self driving car youre actively condemning innocent people instead of letting less innocent people die because of their own mistake see the ethics problem now
573,but then youre not taking into account the fact that many people who die in a car where theyre driving provoked the accident and thus deserved it more than those who did nothing at all in a self driving car youre actively condemning innocent people instead of letting less innocent people die because of their own mistake see the ethics problem now
574,who would you kill then
575,yep id rather die due to a human caused accident than die because my car has a blue screen of death
576,yep id rather die due to a human caused accident than die because my car has a blue screen of death
577,its actually a problem that well have to over come when we make a switch to self driving cars as accidents are a major contributor to organ donations as fucked as that seems
578,you know how many people get life saving organ donations from people killed in car accidents
579,you know how many people get life saving organ donations from people killed in car accidents
580,phrase it like that then yeah but my point was to emphasize the severe consequences when a driver kills someone the argument that thousands of lives can be saved at the expense of a few hundred is such a slippery moral slope science experiments on mice for more reasons than just how fast they reproduce or mature while ultimately its up to politicians and lobbyists some people are fine dying for the greater good i bet most are not or maybe just dont be the unlucky mofo that dies to an algorithm right to be fair yeah some industries can really benefit from automated driving and drunkimpaired drivers will have a way to move around

582,id rather die by a machine making a utilitarian decision than by a dumbass teenager on a phone
583,eventually when traffic deaths plummit and all cars start driving themselves for a while we will look at traffic deaths like elevator deaths now its not a signal that we should not automate it its just a now more unusual accident we all accept that right now you could nothing wrong and still get tboned by some idiot thats somehow fine but the tiniest risk of self driving car killing us is weird
584,eventually when traffic deaths plummit and all cars start driving themselves for a while we will look at traffic deaths like elevator deaths now its not a signal that we should not automate it its just a now more unusual accident we all accept that right now you could nothing wrong and still get tboned by some idiot thats somehow fine but the tiniest risk of self driving car killing us is weird
585,you are exactly right the defining feature of the trolley problem is the killing of specific innocent individuals through conscious action
586,i think hes referring to the specific idea of replacing human drivers with autonomous ones as the trolley problem ie people are getting to focused on the small number of people it kills and ignoring the fact that it saves many more
587,if reducing the total aggregate deaths is all thats relevant then why not allow hospitals the authority to kill terminal patients and harvest the organs to save other lives the total number of lives you protect is irrelevant if you devalue a life to such a degree that it can be sacrificed involuntarily at any time for others benefit
588,its interesting how opinions of the trolley problem change massively if you alter the scenario a little in the classic version polling shows that people prefer the utilitarian side but in a version where the one person about to die isnt aware or isnt on the tracks opinions flip its totally based on emotion people dont normally use much logic for the problem
589,you pick the option which will statistically result in the least number of deaths over time taking you at your word would require fatesome sort of precognitive computer and mean scenarios like in this one story i read where a self driving car kills a guy cant remember if he was passenger or pedestrian because through some means i cant remember like ai connectednesseyes and ears everywhere the ai controlling the car somehow knew the guy would have killed his wife had it let him live to get home
590,flying the plane is the easy part i bet you could train a monkey to keep a plane in the air the hard part is communicating with people on the ground planning flights documenting everything you need to knowing all the regulations that are in place maintaining the plane and of course making sure people dont die in an emergency thats what pilots get paid so much for disclaimer i am not a pilot
591,only k killed a year in car accidents that truly surprises me
592,only k killed a year in car accidents that truly surprises me
593,im not saying the machine should be demonized im all for driverless cars but the question becomes should the driver have the choice of preprograming a kill me or kill pedestrian choice or should the programmers choose and if so what do they choose
594,i understand and am responding to what you wrote a human must take active responsibility because of a dangerous situation once every which means with no human interaction there would beon the extremely limited dataset of the technology of today which is also getting better with every mile drivenone accident however ive years of drivingwith federal government trainingand i have to take constant action to avoid accidents in situations created by other drivers and other drivers are not getting better they are getting more numerous therefore if a human only has to take correction once every miles that means there is less opportunity for humans to screw it up when called upon to do the right thing now imagine a world in the near future where there is a greater percentage of automated cars which reduces the ratio of better drivers there will be less accidents and less incidents for with the cars will have to respond ergo a safer experience your figures support that conclusion
595,consider it a necessary result at no point can a rational argument be made that we should completely halt sdc technology and ban its use because we would rather harvest the organs of the victims of accidents thats asinine
596,its an eye for an eye and its not guaranteed that all of the people dying in accidents will donate edit thinking about it yeah thats a good point
597,greenland is similar but their problem is bears instead of criminals you can literally walk into a store buy a gun and some ammo and then shoot yourself when you get home needless to say their suicide rate is insanely high maybe we should make a checklists when buying a gun something like mental health check up every months and at first purchase minimum time spent at range per year or month proper handling of a weapon preferably with some range time for first purchase criminal history any felonies abuse or duis will make you unable to buy a gun we could change duis to no dius in years would this make it harder to get a gun yes but it wouldnt make it harder for a mentally sound person most mentally sound people arent gonna go out and kill themselves most gun enthusiasts arent gonna be angry over going to the range this seems like a good solution to me will everyone like it probably not not everyone likes it taking a week to buy a gun but is it worth it to prevent suicides im not gonna answer
598,its not at the expense nobody is intentionally killing those people
599,but they shouldnt have been crossing a big road somehow people have been crossing roads for as long as there have been roads are you suggesting we all have to stop doing that now because you want a shiny cat toy not looking and you got that informationwhere i mean thats on top of the fact that your average human cannot outrun your average car please be sure and check back in with us when your child gets killed by one of these things and let us know that the little brat had it coming
600,this is the exact reason people believe in something higher so they have something to blame or explain the unexplainable you can be damn sure in years when all cars are driverless that accidents will be put down to an act of god
601,yeah i think the odds are much better of not having such an accident and also surviving it should it happen if the machine is in control
602,true heck at least if its software related and i die from it it might get fixed how long have we still been having dui related deaths after all this damn time
603,im writing a thesis on this for class using this exact same argument there has been an ethics panel in germany that has made a very similar conclusion valuing human life must take precedence above all else the question is where do we draw the line is it quantitative if there are two pedestrians is it fair to kill just one passenger instead its the trolley car debate on steroids another problem is that research so far indicates that the overwhelming majority of the public wants these cars they just dont want to pay the price with their own lives when someone else could take the fall its a catch that will take government intervention to solve because the automotive industry simply catering to consumer demand could create the scenario that the more you pay the more safety features are added to the car to protect you the passenger over everyone else my thesis in a nutshell it still needs quite a bit of work but this is possibly the most relevant modern day take on utilitarian principles yet sources dobrindt alexander federal government adopts action plan on automated driving bmvi federal government adopts action plan on automated driving august accessed march http dobrindt federal government action plan automated drivinghtml emerging technology from the arkhiv why self driving cars must be programmed to kill mit technology review october accessed march self driving cars must be programmed to kill knight will self driving cars get a code of ethics mit technology review july accessed march to help self driving cars make ethical decisions tuffley david at last the worlds first ethical guidelines for driverless cars the conversation september accessed march http theconversationcomat last the worlds first ethical guidelines for driverless cars
604,theyre still killing more people than theyre saving now
605,self driving cars will really completely change how we deal with car insurance what might end up happening is people buy insurance for their autonomous car and if an accident does happen insurance pays for it and life goes on nobody is charged more since the risk of that particular car getting into another accident is not increased it stayed the same relative to every other autonomous car on the road that particular cars risk of getting into another accident has not changed since every car would ideally have the same programming were still thinking of insurance in terms of who to blame in an accident but when autonomous cars come around they arent going to be making the same mistakes as human drivers if an accident does happen its almost of the time going to be due to something out of the control of any one car the simplest way to handle insuring a vehicle that simply cannot have at fault accidents is just to pay a flat rate and when an accident does happen insurance pays for the damages for that particular car and moves on if there were multiple vehicles involved each vehicles insurance will pay for the damage on their particular vehicle now if an accident does happen that is at the fault of the cars programming that should be up to the software developer to deal with if a glitch in the cars programming causes the accident that developer is responsible for their own software if an accident occurred due to a poorly maintained vehicle that is the responsibility of the vehicles owner to deal with in that case their insurance provider could decide to raise their premiums because they have proven that they dont maintain their vehicle or they could require regular inspections or something like that
606,from the linked wikipedia page problems analogous to the trolley problem arise in the design of autonomous cars in situations where the cars software is forced during a potential crash scenario to choose between multiple courses of action sometimes including options which include the death of the cars occupants all of which may cause harm a platform called moral machine was created by mit media lab to allow the public to express their opinions on what decisions autonomous vehicles should make in scenarios that use the trolley problem paradigm other approaches make use of virtual reality to assess human behavior in experimental settings in the government of germany constituted an ethical commission that addressed the implications of autonomous driving as a result the commission defined rules for autonomous and connected driving which will be obligatory for upcoming laws regarding the production of autonomous cars
607,we can either kill people by letting the programming occasionally do so or we can continue following our freedom to drive which kills other people second choice is letting the train follow its course first is making a conscious decision to to divert the train toward other innocents an action which we deem logically less harmful than the original risk ironically in this case the conscious decision requires a removal of choice while the retention of a likely more harmful situation is retention of human powerchoice by escaping harm in this situation we lose the power to judge individual choices which is counter to a very intense natural human addiction
608,almost no one is so good driver that driveless car wont decrease his chance to die
609,situations can still arise that the car could not have anticipated say if someone walks out onto the street in front of a car so it has to swerve simultaneously it knows that if it is going to swerve it will accounting for all laws of physics hit another person or drive into a wall probably killing the passenger humans will still interact with traffic even if all vehicles are autonomous and it will be a very very long time before that changes
610,doesnt even have to be terminally ill people if harvesting the organs of one person off the street can save the lives of people then the very basic ethical reasoning this poster uses says we should kill them all and harvest their organs
611,if reducing the total aggregate deaths is all thats relevant then why not allow hospitals the authority to kill terminal patients and harvest the organs to save other lives hospitals are in fact administering medication that can be deadly but usually saves lives
612,if the larger group is on the track by their own choice or mistake and the smaller group isnt on trolley tracks you should hit the larger group the smaller group has a reasonable expectation of safety imagine a society where people cant feel safe because they can be actively killed for someone elses mistake its not an emotional response its a long term utilitarian response
613,its totally based on emotion people dont normally use much logic for the problem this is true with many things look at the recent march for our lives movement its biggest driver is school shootings which is a small percentage school shootings of the smallest gun deaths mass shootings more people will be killed by trains or lighting than school shootings but no one will gather to do much of anything about it but you add in emotion and something of little worry becomes world ending
614,or if youre only using hypothetical people that are basically sims what if the one person is a small child and the other are convicted serial rapists what if the are good but average people and the one is a successful surgeon who saves lives on the daily would the op consider it a nonsensical emotional reaction if the people were strangers and the person was his wife and the mother of his children how is it more moral to deprive his children of their mother than to let strangers die further that sort of utilitarian logic isnt how virtually any society on earth runs or has ever runs if it was wed obtain blood and organ donations by force when necessary wed ban individual cars and only allow public transit wed ration and distribute resources in essentially the polar opposite way we currently do for all we know a hypothetical society based on that principle isnt even viable but instead we as a species spend literally centuries discussing the things that are arguably more important than any persons life like freedom of choice and bodily autonomy like whether or not an action that results in positive outcomes is inherently just and if not is an unjust action that has a positive outcome permissible or not are protecting abstract concepts like justice and equality and freedom more important than saving lives etc the trolley problem is only simple if youre too simple to recognize the wider implications beyond the thought experiment
615,ive been hit as a pedestrian times once while still on the footpath the other two times was at an intersection with lights as i crossed with the pedestrian indicator i agree that as a pedestrian its important that you still look both ways crossings and traffic lights with pedestrians signals arent cross whenever theyre you have right of way cross when safe i have seen pedestrians step out on zebra crossings knowing cars have to stop but they dont physically give nearby cars enough time to stop that said i have a visual impairment and while i did look before i crossed i unfortunately missed the car that was barrelling up the parking lane because my brain doesnt really see movement well and i assumed when i saw a car in the parking lane it was well parked he was speeding and in the wrong lane but i did step in front of him without enough time for him to stop i believe that if i wasnt visually impaired i would have avoided that accident so thats kinda on me but also completely the drivers fault for driving in the wrong lane and planning to run the red light the other intersection was completely the drivers fault i was halfway across the road when the driver looked up from his phone saw a green light and just started driving off the green light was for trams not cars pedestrians cyclists and trams had a green signal cars and buses still had red the other time i was walking down the footpath on a small inner city commercial street and a car that was stuck in jammed traffic just randomly pulled to the left to try and get into the parking lane to cut traffic off but he was overzealous and mounted the curb straight into me thankfully the curb took most of the momentum out of the car so i was just knocked over thankfully the only injuries have been bruising and joint dislocations which im prone to anyway the annoying thing is the complete lack of self awareness so many drivers seem to have at their incompetence i can actually legally drive if i want despite my neurological issues with vision i can pass motor department eye exams because they dont test depth perception or movement tracking just can you read text from a few metres away however im not stupid i dont want to become a murderer or a corpse so i dont drive i recognise that just because i legally can doesnt mean i have the skills and ability to do so

617,it shouldnt datafatality analysis reporting system fars every _single_ fatal accident on our roadways has a nhtsa report generated everyone of these reports can be viewed online this includes things like driver and vehicle statistics but condition of the roadway position of passenger in vehicle sequence of events during the accident and whether or not the person was airlifted the hospital and the amount of time it took ive downloaded the fars database and created a program that will allow me to make queries against this data you can ask for example how many times had a car gone airborne before finally coming down and killing a pedestrian times in one incident it involved a pedestrian and his dog walking on a _different_ road that the vehicle departed from anyways as a result it shouldnt be a surprise that we already pay very close attention to vehicle safety and that the number of lives lost given the trillions of miles driven every year will be amazingly low _suicide_ claims more lives in a year than car accidents hell car accidents dont even make the top causes of deathhtm

619,no thats true and im not saying more people dying in accidents is a good thing but the truth of it is that the less people that die in accidents means more possible deaths from lack of donations
620,no thats true and im not saying more people dying in accidents is a good thing but the truth of it is that the less people that die in accidents means more possible deaths from lack of donations
621,first of all youre going off the assumption that people wont kill themselves without access to a gun suicidal people who want to kill themselves wont base that decision on if they have or can get a gun or not a gun just makes it quicker more assured and in some ways far less selfish in my opinion i would completely rid of the waiting period just more time you cant protect yourself extensive background checks and anyone with even a single account of a violent history or any sort of mental instability including certain prescription drugs should be barred from buying guns until deemed mentally fit if ever spending more time at ranges can aid those looking to protect themselves if anything going to a range less means youll be less acquainted with the tool that may save your or your loved ones lives the biggest issue is the fact that people advocate banning guns without looking up statistics its a twitch trigger response to the massively and purposefully wide spread coverage on the recent shootings second issue which is the only reason there will never be a full gun ban in the us is because in general the american people arent stupid enough to hand over their only line of defense between them and their government which is armed to the teeth a demand on a full gun ban will be met with blood in the streets and rightfully so before you dismiss the tyrannical government gone rogue possibility if you even do i dont know remember what happened to the jews in poland during wwii and the fact the powers that be are so desperately trying to disarm the people is worrying and gun owners know exactly whats going on edit i also really like the idea of an annual re check of all gun owners
622,high end you think that will apply reliably to cheap daily drivers really you think that shit wont get hacked and shut down the entire in socal just to entertain some asshole and his friends you think people wont tinker their shit like idiots to make it drive faster and cause accidents as a result you think that when glitches do happen and they sure as hell will theyll only affect one car what happens when someone fucks up the programming on the ford focus and they roll out prone to total failure under some one in a millionthus rather common but not always easy to find ahead of time circumstance what happens when they fuck up some hardware as happens pretty much every year to at least one major manufacturer and the programming doesnt know how to deal with the trouble that the hardware problem causes like an uneven front brake performance under extreme cold while going downhill causing sudden swerve to one side hell what happens when we realize that always put driver safety first or never swerve ends up not actually being a good rule and people die because of stupid programming decisions besides which this tech will not become as common as quickly as elon musk and others think until it can cycle into the secondary market in very large numbers for over a decade while still being safely usable it wont replace the year old hondas and toyotas and old ford pickups on the road so it will be all automated vehicles so road conditions will be less chaotic is blatant nonsense maybe in years maybe if wealth inequality lessens as well in that time

624,no i want people to keep crossing roads for natural selection if you cant do it without getting killed well
625,i wouldnt be surprised if insurance companies tried to pull some stunt like that however acts of god are actually in the contracts for a good reason they are supposed to eliminate coverage for things that affect many people at the same time no insurance company could possibly bunker enough money to handle such situations and if they could it would end up costing significantly more money for the policy holder so a single accident should not fall in this category now if an unexpected solar storm hit causing equally unexpected faults in the driving software and tens of thousands of accidents all happened at the same time that would be the traditional act of god
626,no i mean the driverless vehicle needs to prioritize the safety of its own inhabitants before following an industry wide decision making process on who to hit in a situation where an accident cant be avoided i totally agree with you that driverless cars will statistically be safer than human drivers
627,ai will brake thats it its not going to jump the curb its not going into oncoming traffic to save lives youre right it never happens on top of that there will be no decision making path is obstructed brake if it hits someone a person would have hit that someone and a lot harder and faster and that someone was in the wrong thats of the people who will die to automated cars it will be because they stepped into the road way illegally and the car makers will eat those people alive in the court rooms should they decide to sue with all the data those cars will record the ai will just brake that is all
628,additionally many of the hypothetical questions assume omniscience ie knowledge that the pedestrians on the curb will die and not scatter or be injured this isnt something ai can accurately predict even if it does recognize people on the corner vs in the car any accounting for this will be fuzzy logic at best
629,insurance companies should just go away at this point as we wouldnt need a middleman we should all just pay into a govt fund that then pays out to peoplefamilies injured in accidents involving ai vehicles at standard rates of course so lawyers can go away too as im thinking about it if we just had govt healthcare we would already be paying into a fund that takes care of injuries so maybe we should do that first and get rid of health insurance companies right away too then the fund would just compensate people for lost workpainsuffering ugh im thinking more now wait but compensated why i was born with a genetic defect as a result of bad luck so im not compensated for anything by anyone why should a bad luck victim of a car crash where nobody is at fault and there was no intent to harm be compensated
630,insurance companies should just go away at this point as we wouldnt need a middleman we should all just pay into a govt fund that then pays out to peoplefamilies injured in accidents involving ai vehicles at standard rates of course so lawyers can go away too as im thinking about it if we just had govt healthcare we would already be paying into a fund that takes care of injuries so maybe we should do that first and get rid of health insurance companies right away too then the fund would just compensate people for lost workpainsuffering ugh im thinking more now wait but compensated why i was born with a genetic defect as a result of bad luck so im not compensated for anything by anyone why should a bad luck victim of a car crash where nobody is at fault and there was no intent to harm be compensated
631,doesnt even have to be terminally ill people if harvesting the organs of one person off the street can save the lives of people then the very basic ethical reasoning this poster uses says we should kill them all and harvest their organs no because that decision is not ours to make but that persons in case of the collision the car driver is the one making the choice that being said donating organs is legal using organs of dead people is legal and euthanasia should be legal so you can almost do that
632,which lives theyre not giving potentially deadly medicine to some healthy guy on the street in an attempt to save the lives of their patients in the icu the trolley question is concerned with whether intervening to consciously choose to end the life of someone else who has no say in the matter is justified to save multiple people who would otherwise have died from events over which the chooser had no role in creating not whether its justified to intervene to save said lives by taking actions which might result in ending them in some different fashion but could possibly spare one or more of them in the process
633,in the path of a runaway train car are five railway workmen who will surely be killed unless you a bystander do something if you flip a switch the train will be diverted onto a set of tracks in need of repair the train will be derailed and go down a hill across a road and into a mans yard the owner sleeping in his hammock will be killed in this situation would you fl ip the switch as usual its broad and vague you dont know that the five workmen made a mistake they work there youd expect to see them on the tracks and you dont even know if it was their choice to be there they may have been ordered to be there you could only justify the kill five people utilitarian view here if you filled in the gaps with information you made up the scenario is almost identical to the original version it shouldnt warrant a wildly different response to opinion polls
634,i wasnt meaning that in a way that i thought you were wrong or anything i just imaged the number to be way higher id never looked it up ive got a lot of firefighters in my family and feel like i hear about a fatal crash daily guess i assumed wrong
635,but that glitch will happen way less often than idiots causing accidents and the more cars are autonomous the less random factors happen thus less unpredictable bugglitch thus less accidents
636,once we actually reach fully self driving vehicles they will be designed completely differently than todays vehicles the safety of people inside will probably be a much greater part of the design so crashes are going to be less dangerous for the passengers anyway i feel like this problem is overblown by people thinking that the cars will look and be designed the same way they are now

638,this whole damned debate is moot some philosophers pondered whether an ai should analyze potential victims and survival rates like i robot and theorized a debate over what the criteria should be self driving cars will react to avoid an accident by driving within appropriate reacting distance you should not be driving faster than you can see to stop we as humans think were awesome and drive as we see fit tailgating like a mofo at mph so we philosophically believe that any sort of technology needs to trade off efficiency with usability leading to the debate about who needs to die first but really as per drivers ed and actual research we should be driving to allow enough time and distance to stop if the car in front of us stops self driving cars can actually adhere to this and thereby avoid unavoidable accidents by following the correct guidelines

640,i hate this argument the car will prioritize the rules of the road first that dramatically limits what the car can or cannot do in a collision and the choosing who lives and dies argument largely goes away eg a rear end collision is imminent driving into the sidewalk would avoid the crash even if the sidewalk is clear it shouldnt do it and just try to stop as fast as possible even though it means a collision

642,lots of people just need something to hang on to in the belief they are actually better than a machine at driving and hide behind the convenient trolley problem to claim superiority they dont want to become outdated and inferior because in reality most accidents will happen because of inattentiveness intoxicating not following rules and do intuitive but fatal reactions humans will somehow make the car skid sideways and kill both the blind man and the child admitting were going to be outclassed is hard well until some insurance company somehow figures they can get the same settlement uber had to pay for any car accident with the excuse you are suppose to be better than a machine and causing an accidents will bankrupt you

644,isnt just brake kindasorta a trolley problem you could think of dozens of scenarios where instead of just break a human driver might swerve left and choose to side swipe another vehicle instead of running over a bunch of children playing in the street but the just break ai just breaks and so your car kills a bunch of kids
645,i think the question is regarding when the system fails and somebody dies computers are going to fail thats inevitable
646,not spot on actually the statement if it hits someone a person would have hit that someone is patently incorrect particularly in these the early days of the technology anyone who has built out anything of the type be it facial recognition or text to speech will admonish you for the pitfalls of that thinking yes it will be safer in aggregate and yes it will often prevent accidents that a human being would not have but it is absolutely going to kill a bunch of people where if you had a reasonable driver behind the wheel there is no way they make that mistake

648,when i was getting my drivers licence thats what my instructor old me you should just brake try to change lanes and break at the same time or just change lanes without looking and youll likely cause another worst accident
649,imagine sueing god lightning destroys your home or kills a family member you decide to sue god by proxy the church literally the only legal defence would be for the church to prove that god doesnt exist fun
650,which is exactly why they will always prioritize their own inhabitants its also why it would actually be immoral to design a self driving car that didnt prioritize its own inhabitants because discouraging even a few people from buying self driving cars could potentially kill many
651,because in reality most accidents will happen because of inattentiveness intoxicating not following rules and do intuitive but fatal reactions humans will somehow make the car skid sideways and kill both the blind man and the child dont forget bad urban planning
652,because in reality most accidents will happen because of inattentiveness intoxicating not following rules and do intuitive but fatal reactions humans will somehow make the car skid sideways and kill both the blind man and the child dont forget bad urban planning
653,youre reading the words and missing the point if it swerves its going to be a controlled swerve the same kind recommended in driving courses its never going to jump a curb onto a side walk or drive headfirst into oncoming traffic to avoid someone who steps into the road if people illegally walk into the road and there is person on the side and oncoming car with no one even in it the car will brake and hopefully only kill a few of the people who broke the law
654,hmm is that because killing people here is more utilitarian or because killing a sleeping person makes you more guilty of a crime
655,can you prove theyre not killing more people than theyre saving
656,thats what you have redundant sensors for aircraft parts are fly to fail because when one fails you have a backup if you have redundant sensors in the car then as soon as one goes out the car will auto drive itself to a maintenance location within x hours tbd timeframe based on reliability studies for sensor life you drive yourself to the hospital when one eye is blinded because you dont expect your second eye to go blind in the next half hour
657,people i this thread are not thinking deeply enough not all collisions are fatal sometimes a driver might just be firmly shaken or perhaps only gently tapped do you want your car to prioritize you not getting gently tapped ahead of killing someone else real world example pedestrian appears ahead of your car suddenly your car correctly calculates that it can avoid killing the pedestrian by braking hard but it also calculates you will may be rear ended by a trailing that is following too close if you brake a collision that in theory might kill you but almost certainly will be no worse than bruises and might not happen at all if the rear driver is alert enough do you still want the car to run down the pedestrian
658,but then what if my car tries to protect me at the expense of you and your car tries to protect you at the expense of me or some other driver do our cars start fighting or do poor people with shittier smart cars get killed by rich people with newer smarter smart cars the apocalypse better get here quick cuz the future is looking crazy
659,if prioritizing the inhabitants life kills though thats immoral
660,honest question how many wrecks have you been in not trying to argue against your point but if a car is going fast enough to actually hit a tree instead of stoppibg short of it then its traveling fast enough to grievously injure or kill its occupant between thingsdebris entering into the vehicle and the inertia of a thousand pound vehicle coming to a sudden stop no internal safety component can guarantee injury prevention
661,oh so we agree that it wont just brake then great but once evasive maneuvers are on the table as of course they will be then were already in the realm of having to design algorithms that must factor in risk probabilities how clear does the next lane over have to be for the car to make the lane change percent safe then some collisions will happen that could have been avoided or some lower number that minimizes total expected accidents over time but now the car will subject its occupants to risky emergency lane changes rather than gunning down pedestrians in its path and bam now were in trolley problem land
662,simply because there is ample opportunity to consult those persons and let them make their own choices this still doesnt argue in favor of the utilitarian viewpoint you are asserting that there is some value in the opinions of the people who are going to die this is different from saying you do what will statistically result in the least number of deaths even so this doesnt take into account organ harvesting which truly is immediately necessary maybe two people really need organs right now and there is a healthy person in the lobby we can carve up
663,thats exactly the point if the car following you was self drivung it would have a safe following distance and neithet the pedestrian or any of the people in any of the cars are hurt at the most you might have spilled some coffee the accident here would be rear ending and human error
664,what if we got rid of human based weaknesses for example humans need windows to see in a hypothetical ai driven vehicle those become expensive weak points why not make a car with no windows to lessen the risk of penetration in a crash why have all seats face forward when you could have rear facing seating so a deceleration pushes you back into a seat cushion rather than forwards into a dashboard or through a window why not have point restraints rather than point restraints and airbags at face or chest height to reduce distance to impact if you dont have to put glass there if a human being doesnt have to waste hours of their time driving can cars go at slower safer speeds id be fine only going if i can use the computer while i do if computers have better reflexes than humans can we go faster i think a big part of ai car design will be getting over the artificial restrictions imposed by our understanding of cars as driven once we decouple their design from the requirements of a human driver well do much better in terms of safety
665,ive been in a couple of wrecks that totaled the car i was in i was driving in one and a passenger in the other i had no injuries beyond a scrape on my chin from the airbag and some minor aches and pains i was also once hit by a car going about miles an hour which caused me to roll over the hood i was legally crossing at a crosswalk when the guy turned onto the road without looking my aches and pains were about times worse than my previous car accidents and i also had a concussion which caused headaches difficulty concentration and poor memory for about two weeks and i had extreme anxiety over the idea that my brain might never work the same again i would sure as hell prefer to be in a car that hits a tree than be in a car that hits a person cars are designed to minimize the force of the impact to the passengers and i would rather take my chances that those safety features wont protect me than mow down a person with zero protection knowing first hand how little it takes to cause them damage
666,a friend of mine hit a stream light that was sitting on a cement cylinder at about mph and he was fine i hit a sign going about the same speed and was also fine neither of us could stop but neither was gravely injured either reducing the impulse from a collision is what airbags are for the car should be able to sense a branch sticking out of the tree that would impale the driver but probably couldnt tell if a tree might fall on the car after being struck by it but then you have your trolley problem again its interesting to think about would we start charging reckless pedestrians with manslaughter if they jumped in front of one of these cars and its algorithm killed the driver or should we have the car strike the pedestrian maybe we can write two algorithms and have the owner choose
667,ive been in a lot of accidents only one of which was an impact at any serious speed the rest were between and kmshour because typically theres time to react just not enough to totally avoid the collision so dodging some kids on the road and hitting a tree at low speed in my mind is more likely than hitting that tree with speed and id much rather the tree than a group of kids the chances of injury to me are low the kids however
668,honest question how many wrecks have you been in not trying to argue against your point but if a car is going fast enough to actually hit a tree instead of stoppibg short of it then its traveling fast enough to grievously injure or kill its occupant its quite likely that the car will be able to reduce the speed somewhat even if not completely in addition the car sees it coming and will be able to activate all security measures like airbags well on time
669,my background is in developing algorithms for data analysis banking and investments but my programming skills amount to a well trained script kiddie at best so im finding it quite difficult simply from a programming perspective i understand the concepts at a much higher level than my educators but stumble hard on implementation i think most programs ive looked into teach the concepts well but infosec is a lot more commoditized than machine learning so if you dont plan to rise to the top youll have more demand and opportunity in infosec with a basic level of understanding everyone needs a secure database but few people need a simple neural network would you happen to have any recommendations for learning to program more as a subconscious reflex im very goal oriented so doing more exercises for the sake of exercises kills me inside python

671,its just a tragic accident at that point may as well make the parents responsible for not keeping track of their child
672,imagine the world in which tired and drunk drivers no longer kill other people on the roads were at the cusp of that though flip side i dont think weve considered how disruptive this will be to people who drive vehicles for a living
673,i used to have a hr commute for school i dream of the day when we can legally sleep in self driving cars i know that being awake should be mandatory to prevent accidents but a man can dream
674,whaaat my dad and i drove to san diego from la in his tesla and it kept telling him to push the steering wheel buttons every so often in autopilot eventually my dad just stopped paying attention and the car stopped autopilot until we reached our destination
675,the things that drives me nuts about all of these articles is that they blame tesla for what people are doing anyone using a defeat device for their ap hand detection is a scumbag and deserves a steep ticket anyone intentionally thinking they can grab a nap is a scumbag putting people in danger and deserves an arrest immediately assume that the person is doing whatever is happening intentionally there will probably be dozens of people that accidentally fall asleep while driving this week and crash hopefully solo but many will crash into other people there will probably be at least a handful of seizuresstrokesdiabetic shock whatevers this week that cause someone to crash those things are most likely not that persons fault gloss over the fact that not one of these instances being rabidly spread all over the internet ends with a collision much less injury people have so many reasons why they crash some of them may be happening in these videos but everyones knee jerk reaction is fuck that guy for intentionally sleeping he should die and tesla is to blame how about acknowledge that this technology might save you from death if you or one of your fellow motorists has a medical emergency while driving it safely got this guy down the road for allegedly minutes without incident id say thats pretty remarkable

678,until the vast majority of vehicles are changed to self driving models you will not be able to just sleep safely in your car its not even the automatic drivers its the human ones that will still be causing accidents and speeding and everything
679,maybe i heard this somewhere else but imagine self driving ubers and the like where the human driver died nobody wants to get in those cars so they just send it off to get another one most people arent compassionate enough to care so eventually we end up with all these mobile coffins driving around
680,rationally insurance rates should drastically drop after self driving automobiles prove to be faultless in auto accidents something tells me however big insurance will still be outrageously overpriced
681,i pray that when this guy finally crashes its into a guard rail by himself and not into another driver
682,i pray that when this guy finally crashes its into a guard rail by himself and not into another driver
683,if his little thing tied around that steering wheel fell off and he was still sleeping he would have slammed into somebody going miles per hour miladinovich said not true if autopilot detects that youre not gripping the wheel and you continuously ignore or arent awake to notice all of its warnings it will put your hazards on and gradually slow to a stop still not the safest situation on a freeway but its not like it just shuts autopilot off and lets you just drift until you crash ironically the thing falling off might have been the best thing that could happen since the warnings could have woken him up
684,eventually someone will die in one and the car will just keep driving around
685,drinking beers with buddies in the car and be like did you know we had to drive these things hahaha
686,heres the thing drivers have always fallen asleep at the wheel especially on long commutes the fact that a tesla driver gets caught sleep driving means a traditional car hasnt fallen asleep at the wheel wrecked and potentially killed someone
687,this isnt about expectations people falling asleep while driving is something that happens and the difference is that having this tesla functionality reduces the likelihood of it resulting in a fatal collision someone falling asleep in their fully human driven car wont be reported as that driver of human drive car falls asleep because its commonplace it will only be mentioned at all on the news if their inevitable crash is fatal some day that will be rare enough to be specific news and tesla is doing the most heavy lifting to get us there
688,should have renamed this article attempted fearmongering about technology when said technology saved people on the highway from a inattentive driver fall asleep in a standard car and a crash is pretty much guaranteed fall asleep in a car with automated assistance and nobody got hurt
689,the same thing happened when cruise control became mainstream morons would turn cruise control on and go take a nap in the back seat expecting the car to take care of itself this isnt oh my god a tesla crashed this is moron fell asleep behind the wheel
690,we are now going through a period where jackasses will get themselves killed i still cant believe they let cars drive themselves on the highway these sensors are not infallible
691,its going to be great and so much saferwhen that one accident happened where the biker was run over people where acted like it was the technologies fault but the guy literally just drove onto the street from behind an obstacleits sad that it happened but a human driver couldnt have prevented that
692,give me a break a passenger took the photo the driver of the other car took that photo probably could have caused an accident in the process too
693,a sleeping driver in any other car would have crashed
694,what happens if you flail around your sleep like if you accidentally turnpress on the gas or brake while the car is self driving
695,no thanks we are nowhere close to this working well id rather not sleep and never wake up because my fancy car killed me
696,i will never rely on a computer to control a vehicle moving at mph its a computer it can be hacked its been proven already too many people rely on computers if the world died no power or internet it would take less than hrs for half the world to die off and leave the smart ones to thrive
697,bringing new meaning to i want to die in my sleep
698,teslas smart because all of their user data is collected pre crash so no one can sue them for dumb shit on the highway i take to work a driver fell asleep at the wheel auto pilot didnt know if he was exiting and ended up crashing into the median his family tried to sue tesla but they said hed been given several visual and audible warnings but his hands hadnt touched the wheel in six seconds talk about a cya
699,guy falls asleep at wheel amazing tesla keeps him from crashing for at least miles
700,these stories are always reported poorly i almost guarantee this guy didnt start his trip thinking hed sleep while ap drove his car very likely he dozed while driving with ap on and ap has likely saved an accident from happening normally when a driver nods off while driving theyll last about meters before bad things happen i guess you could make the argument that having ap on makes it more likely to doze off but i find that hard to believe driving in bumper to bumper traffic is not stimulating with or without ap
701,that guy is lucky he didnt get killed the software isnt autonomous
702,i find this both fascinating and maybe for lack of a better word stupid i think as a whole most of us humans are morons you can see it happening and im sure other prior events can do the same with the invention of smart phones people would rather answer a text than surveying the road as they drive or on a bike or when walking down stairs or walking in general you can put to the imagination all the accidents that do and will occur i used to joke about this sleeping in cars and now its happening doesnt matter if ai is safer than human driving its like trusting a stranger to watch your kid for minutes as you go to the bathroom
703,and then people blame tesla when this irresponsible person has an accident
704,this is why self driving cars must became the norm with a standar on instead of a funny new you whould have a report on a car crash due to a sleepee driver
705,i drive miles total each day i would kill for an hour extra if snooze this needs to be standard on all vehicle
706,yeh hes going to crash lol p fact is it can autopilot you but it doesnt account for when idiots dont stop in time and its more difficult for it to navigate roundabouts or someone pulls up in front of you as ive learned from tesla drivers you need to be awake to get ready to switch to manual or hit the breaks when needed even when technology gets even better you cant take out the human equation completely you still need to stop and recharge your car at some point on longer journeys too
707,i immediately thought of all the stories of people falling asleep at the wheel a causing accidents maybe its people purposely sleeping but theres definitely some people that are accidentally falling asleep and for them its much safer
708,alternate headline driver that appeared to be fully sleeping kept alive by tesla for at least miles on socals freeway this may have been a genuine incident where if the driver had been in a non self driving analog car they may have died or injured others
709,i still dont to wake up by being killed by my car and i dont want to wake up dead either
710,more accidents will arise from self driving cars because of the people still in awe and filming them while driving their regular cars in heavy traffic
711,theres a long damn way to go before the general public is willing to let software control a pound moving vehicle completely autonomously lots of people are going to be hurt or killed in the process
712,imagine what would happen if everyone had self driving cars there would be way way way less accidents and probably better traffic times
713,since this person is not died it actually works its very dangerous but it works
714,i was in shock when i read about this idiot and then i looked up the statistics for level tesla autopilot accidents its amazingly low see below link still i think by doing something so stupid and being videod doing so it simply places more pressure on tesla to require more human oversight while ap is enabled tldr fatalities on ap enwikipediaorgwikilist_of_self driving_car_fatalities
715,or maybe he accidentally fell asleep at the wheel and the car prevented a potentially serious accident after a long day at work supervising the car drive you home is pretty boring its not hard to see people falling asleep
716,maybe we just need something like an idiot button you have to press every five minutes or so to prove youre awake if you dont press it maybe an audio cue and it automatically pulls over something like that i know it wouldnt be quite that easy still when you consider how many horrible accidents already happen when people fall asleep at the wheel id feel much safer if mr sleepy was in a tesla
717,maybe he died that would be kinda funny actually if you decide to end it you know set your destination to the morgue pop the cyanide and your body gets neatly and conveniently delivered to your final destination
718,technology hasnt caught up with expectations umm the guy should have been expected to be in an accident and there was no accident if say that this was just the opposite technology surpassed expectations that said dont do this it is stupid and it is dangerous tesla should put software to detect these bypass devices eg constant pull on the wheel and permanently disable ap on those cars
719,tesla is going to get people killed with their dishonest pr and marketing
720,this is the reason im not crazy about anything other than self driving when it goes to driving automation yes driver assist systems are meant to make driving safer but it can also be a crutch for poorly skilled or inattentive drivers as well possibly with disastrous results with lane change assist for example how many people know how let allow check their blind spots when changing lanes when they have those systems just because you have a system that does it when you forget doesnt mean you should stop doing it what if the system fails for some reason just as youre making the lane change self driving cars becoming commonplace cant come soon enough for me
721,i mean he didnt crash so it looks like it did well i he fell asleep in a non autonomous car we wouldnt even be talking about it he would just end up with the rest of the sleep at the wheel statistics
722,to be honest this is gonna be a case of natural selection you dumbasses keep falling asleep its not my problem if your car crashes regards elon musk
723,to be honest this is gonna be a case of natural selection you dumbasses keep falling asleep its not my problem if your car crashes regards elon musk
724,did he crash if not i would consider it being a case of technology passing up expectations so did he crash or not if not why are people even talking about this when we have protests in hong kong and actual news
725,while this is super cool if you see something like this on the highway dont just film it call the police this guy can do whatever he wants with his own life but if i got killed by some idiot literally sleeping on the highway id be pissed
726,how is this surprising at all people are idiots self driving cars are the dumbest idea now theres lane avoidance adaptive cruise control self parking cars people are relying on too much tech and nobodies even learning how to drive properly
727,im sorry but every aspect of the current systems is designed to have a human paying attention and ready to take over at a moments notice its not good for snoozing on the highway its downright dangerous and its exactly the behaviour that is putting self driving back as it needs to be idiot proofed from people who do exactly what is being done by this guy on the highway an even bigger issue will be when people start being comfortable enough to fully turn around or lay back in their cars in the event of an accident whether their fault or not none of the current safety devices will protect from injuries as someones body hits the steering wheel side on or any other position not considered level will be a long long way away in all but the most controlled circumstances
728,it will be but the software thats currently deployed to tesla vehicles is absolutely not suitable for being literally asleep at the wheel you might be fine itll handle typical highway traffic just fine merges are occasionally dicey and construction areas are hands on for sure but that kind of behavior really is asking to crash
729,until all cars on the road are self driving you cant possibly consider falling asleep on the wheel because there are idiot drivers out there who can still cause an accident
730,agree i own a non ap tesla and it drives me nuts when i see posts like this this technology isnt there yet and when this guy or someone just as stupid as he is kills himself or innocent people tesla is going to be the one to take the fall for it this is why we cant have nice things fuck this guy
731,as an owner and an active participant in the tesla community i dont hear anyone talking about this in any way other than a guy being extremely reckless behavior like this whether its sleeping or trolling is incredibly frustrating and people who own and love the cars are regularly educating those less familiar with the current limitations of the tech this is the future and we can all talk about it that way because in the future it will be safe to do this after the technology is ready and federal regulations have been passed it is not safe to do this today not even close and these people are putting lives in danger by not understanding or willingly ignoring the limitations of the technology what i think probably happened here is this guy got sick of the tesla nag that requires your hands to be on the wheel and defeated it by tying some sort of weight to the wheel incredibly reckless move and then accidentally fell asleep incredibly reckless move despite this he hasnt crashed that is the one positive to take away from it the technology prevented a driver who fell asleep from injuring himself or others despite his reckless behavior its ok to applaud that while continuing to iterate to make this sort of thing harder to do recklessly

733,i mean if people copy this act crash and then the price of tesla stocks plummets he has only himself to blame
734,lol the comcastbig oil shill hating on people who support a company pushing for a better future cnbc told me that telsa was going to be worth and the rednecks that double park supercharger stations told me that elons a snake oil salesmen that means anyone who isnt a short is a shill litterally nobody is advocating sleeping behind the wheel in but you will be seeing more of this as self driving improves fuck outahere here with your faux think of the children bs people are allowed to be impressed when they see something operating smoothly while just years ago would have resulted in a death somehow i doubt youre on the google map subreddit crying about how many people are killed because they were looking at their phones while driving
735,well the full tesla autopilot is still a far better driver than any human so it doesnt bother me if thats what the car was using the title is wrong the expectations are far behind the technology it will take time but eventually the greater public will realize the advantages that already exist xb it boils down to this the more people using autopilot the less people die what else matters xb edit im open to having my mind changed always looking for reputable statistics that disprove what i already know until then seems like youre agreeing with the person above purely because its cool to hate on something people are excited about elon musk fanboys like musk or not and i dont love him hes doing some incredible things
736,people continuing to overestimate technology they dont understand is going to lead to injuries and death it annoys me when people gasp about how their car is like magic this technology is far from perfect pay the fuck attention before you kill somebody idiot
737,so you can get around this by letting your hand hang from the side of your wheel at the to oclock position that will exert enough torque on the wheel to satisfy the nagging and is the only way these people can get away with it now this guy is an idiot though and may get himself killed
738,its not a fully capable self driving car it has and does shut off at any time for lots of reasons long term sure at this point its playing with fire and its going to get someone killed
739,its not a self driving car for starters it will deactivate at any time for many reasons its a bad thing because its an accident waiting to happen and will kill some innocent person on their way home from work
740,its not a self driving car for starters it will deactivate at any time for many reasons its a bad thing because its an accident waiting to happen and will kill some innocent person on their way home from work
741,because you cant do that its like driving home from the pub when youre bladdered you would complete most journeys complete fine but youd increase the probability of a horrific accident to a level thats considered unacceptable and that makes doing it understandably illegal
742,from time to time computers do crash
743,in an ordinary car this happens of the time you fall asleep you die with tesla there is a chacne you die maybe a lot less
744,i think he said that we will never have safe self driving cars but heres the thing they dont have to be they just need to be safer than the average person to make the statistics of deathsaccidentsinjuries lower thats a job well done
745,ive heard this point alot and would like to ask you something lets assume we are in the far future like to years from now the self driving cars are legitimately better divers than people if all cars were self driving we could lets say get rid of traffic lights and accident rates drop to next to none drinking and driving or driving impaired is no longer a problem would that be enough of a case to give up on the aspect of driving yourself or having to go to a track whenever people can drive them selves kinda like what people do with horse now a days would honestly like to get your opinion as i myself dont like driving as it is right now
746,it can be easily disengaged and if it does thats a guaranteed and completely unnecessary accident at high speed
747,riskier riskier are you crazy even in these early days of automated driving theyve already proven to be much safer than human drivers do you know how many accidents humans cause compared to automated cars per capita maybe do some homework friend and that ratio will only spread more as tech improves
748,more like people are gonna get people killed because theyre not adhering to the rules tesla is setting out and being well human if tesla was being dishonest and saying you can take an entire trip without concentrating on the road at all they wouldnt have added the system of alerts that tell you to get hands on or have autopilot shutdown if you dont listen to them not trying to shill or argue just providing the counter point that people and the driver will always be the weakest link
749,this is true but it can also be true that people kill other people on the road constantly without the help of automation and even with jerkoffs like this automation is way safer than manual driving even in the seminal state its in now you cant argue that its an easily provable fact
750,maybe he is dead maybe the future of self driving cars will include a bunch of people who died at the wheel and are just endlessly driving around the country slowly decomposing into piles of goo
751,exactly this i think we will transition from owning cars to streaming them to use a modern paradigm imagine you pay a subscription fee to a auto drive service which has a massive selection of specialist cars you can set up a regular commute so a car will be at your door ready for when you want to set off and can ad hoc request a car any time you want the benefits literally billions of dollars worth of parking real estate is freed up every major venue needs massive amounts of parking if everyone had auto drives this could be eliminated overnight this would fundamentally change how large venues are constructed all theyd need are massive drop off areas every residential home can convert their garage to another room house values increase now think about the auto drive service you think theyre going to build cars with seats all facing forward no if youre travelling alone a single seater in the middle ultra comfy if you pay enough have a gaming car show up complete with consolespc and high speed internet commuting for work work station car commuting overnight bed car people will immediately try to gotcha this idea by saying stuff like yeah sounds good until your morning car shows up with vomit in it yes this will happen on the cheaper services youll also have situations where on cheaper services there isnt an ad hoc car available itll run by capitalist rules if you pay for a cheaper less renowned service youll get worse service like flying ryan air you know what youre paying for ultimately though the cheapest service will open up most of the freedom and economic liberty to the poorest who have never been able to afford a car or lessons and people who currently have the means to own and run a car which is crazy expensive will probably pay about half as much as they do now for a top end service with all the bells and whistles honestly i cant see the future going any other way only millionaires will own a personal self drive because whats the damn point in owning one oh and other benefits you never have to defrost your car you never have to worry about maintenance you never have to get an mot you never have to change a tire you never have to gas it up you never have to park it you never have to wait for it to warm up in the mornings ive absolutely gone off on one here i love this topic rant edit and i didnt even mention the automatic benefits massive reduction in car accidents less traffic less polution edit a lot of people talking about the dystopian potential of this i completely agree here is where ive spoken about that a bit i left it out of this because i intentionally wanted to paint a positive aspirational picture context
752,look forward to when self driving cars are the norm so accidents drop to virtually zero so cars are designed with comfort and entertainment in mind i would work all day friday hop in the car and play games and then crash and wake up in new orleans or chicago or florida for the weekend come sunday when were done partying hop back in the car and sleep and be home in time for monday morning bonus points for these cars being electric and the doctor octopus tesla chargers being standard so it wouldnt even cost anything and it would stop and recharge and then take off again all on its own not to mention the first person to create an affordable luxury electric rv with solar roof and self driving will be a gazillionaire so many people would happily give up their home for a nice rv and live life on the road with a vehicle that doubles as a home and costs nearly nothing to upkeep and allows them to visit anywhere they want and live there on a whim theres so much potential for our future if we can just sort our shit out and stop fighting with each other over nonsense for a while hope i see it before i die

755,and you know that feeling of confusion when you are waking up imagine that compounded by being in a car crash at the time hurray
756,i yearn for the day when we read the headline like driver of self driving car died from heart attack mid drive and arrives home for the holidays dead
757,my main priorities for self driving cars arent for long distance but rather peak hour give me a car that will merge at high speeds accelerate at green lights quickly and wont crash try to cut people off or stop to make an exit
758,its going to kill airlines you could go from san francisco to la completely while asleep
759,he may not have chose to sleep weve all fell asleep at the wheel at some point i guess and driving a vehicle will make to try very hard not to if you dont have the same burden of responsibility to stay awake then my guess is you end up sleeping like this guy hell ive even fell asleep riding a motorbike and i nearly died from that who would have though that was even possible if youre tired enough it will happen
760,sure if there arent any trucks around qteslaautopilottractortrailer tesla autopilot has been crashing into tractor trailers for three years now the deaths keep racking up and tesla seems to either be unable to fix it or not care
761,yeah it kills me and ill be the first to admit i enjoy how modern cars allow me to relax behind the wheel when cruising down a highway thanks to features but the idea that i would ever close my eyes and try to hack my car with other people with lives around me is so ridiculously perverse the very fact this gets filmed so much shows how distracting it is to others let alone the danger of hacking ones own car
762,for some values of fully automated driving waymo is but uber killed someone after about million miles driven the national average is per million miles sure its a single data point but it definitely doesnt reinforce a blanket statement of fully automated driving is already safer than human driving
763,to be considered safer than a human driver it has to kill at most person per million miles the technology has not proved itself to be safer than a human driver despite what tesla pr says
764,pay the fuck attention before you kill somebody idiot human drivers have already been cavalier about this for decades before any kind of smart tech was in cars at all the new technology is filling a horrible existing gap more than its creating one
765,also considering the very small amount of self driving car on the road why do so many of the drivers fall asleep on the wheelat least thats what it looks like so does that mean they would all be dead if they drive a regular car i know people are excited to see something from their dreams in real life but thats not always good these cars are still in the very early stage and if one of these cars crashes in a horrible accident because of distractedsleeping driver people are automatically going to blame the manufacturer when its still their responsibility to drive and be aware

768,k maybe not the dumbest but a horrible idea the only reason we dont have flying cars everywhere by now is because people are idiots cant see self driving cars turning out much better imo people rely way too much on tech that might not always be there for example theres apparently a need for cars now to basicly tell you hey youre about to leave your child in the back of this hot car to die i guess its a good thing but pathetic that its necessary
769,add in that all of the cars are linked to each other and know exactly where each one is nearby what they are doing and plan on doing and you eliminate slow traffic and accidents
770,i agree with everything you said and look forward to a future of self driving cars mobility would increase drastically and the economic benefits are enticing add cross country bullet trainsit would be so nice however the one hiccup i see is in the transportation of children they need car seats as a child passeneger safety technician instructor of car seats are either wrong seat for the child used improperly installed wrong or any combination thereof add having to put them in and take then out for every tripi only see that worsening parents sacrificing safety for convenience will also increase happens already about age unfortunately a car with car seats pre installed may sound like the solution but each child needs their own configuration to fit the seat properly and in the right direction all seats would need to be the same so parents know how to use it properly each brand has their own gimmick or special thing which is a pain in the ass and each family has a different number of kids with varying ages this is the majority of our population and then theres special needs children with even more specialized seats cars are designed around the safety of adults car seats adapt children to the safety features because their little bodies cannot withstand crash forces nor fit a standard seat belt without one until cars are designed for infants and children car seats will always be needed and our hopes of a fully autonomous vehicle world with be burdened with this issue edit fixed some words

772,to add on this there will never be traffic anymore every car will be tied into the grid and super computers will calculate the most efficient routes for people and their destinations that tie in the millions of vehicles on the road for daily commuters the computer will adjust times based on the flow of demand the cars can move in sequence with each other closer in tandem and convoy lines there will never be accidents unless by natural causes like weather or animals there will still be self drive areas located outside of cities but highways will have a dedicated autonomous lanes that will never be slow or backed up your vehical will sync up to the autonomous convoy and fall in line
773,rent everything till you die yeah thats where its going thankfully with remote work one can live in a cheaper less developed part of the world where owning your couch will still be affordable
774,what about hacking or something like that if a hacker decides to kill a ton of people and gets into the cars they can if they want also the government can easily use this for their own corrupt purposes
775,then crash thats my biggest fear about self driving cars and wake up in new orleans thats my second biggest fear about self driving cars
776,i would work all day friday hop in the car and play games and then crash and wake up in new orleans or chicago or florida for the weekend que jobs expecting you to travel for work and not paying for that because you can just get there by sleeping
777,look forward to when self driving cars are the norm so accidents drop to virtually zero so cars are designed with comfort and entertainment in mind youre looking for a train they exist and if people actually used them wed be in a hell of a lot better situation than we are currently
778,i think a hurdle with self driving cars being accepted will be the types of crashes the accident rates will be lower overall but well see some really stupid autopilot accident a human would not do and find it hard to trust also we accept humans make occasional errors but anytime autopilot makes an error even if safer overall everyone will be sue the car company out of existance etc im sure well get there but it will take a while

781,the big issue stupid people have with self driving cars is they would rather have fatal accidents they can point a finger and blame on a human than fatal accidents cause by a computer
782,unfortunately in order to have a situation where there are virtually no accidents manually driven cars will need to be banned which is going to be a long long way off in addition roads will have to be in exceptional condition with markings painted properly in many parts of the uk where i live the roads are in such a terrible state that autonomous cars simply wouldnt be able to work unless someone comes up with a much faster and more accurate form of gps to avoid the need for markings to be detected by cameras sadly i dont think this fully autonomous car era will be seen by anyone currently alive today at least in the way were discussing where driver liability can be completely removed from the equation
783,ah and let the car decide to kill you to save lives
784,the places you want to go are really weird chicago new orleans or florida what are you trying to do get killed
785,my worry is that insurance companys will fight self driving cars until their last breath imagine reducing the number of crashes to virtually zero why would we ever need insuranceand if an accident were to happen it would be the manufacture who should cover because its their driving system
786,my worry is that insurance companys will fight self driving cars until their last breath imagine reducing the number of crashes to virtually zero why would we ever need insuranceand if an accident were to happen it would be the manufacture who should cover because its their driving system

788,i see one major problem lawsuits today something like people a year dies in car crashes lets say self driving cars get that down to year or less the families of those people could easily sue tesla out of existence progress
789,i see one major problem lawsuits today something like people a year dies in car crashes lets say self driving cars get that down to year or less the families of those people could easily sue tesla out of existence progress
790,i see one major problem lawsuits today something like people a year dies in car crashes lets say self driving cars get that down to year or less the families of those people could easily sue tesla out of existence progress
791,next round of car safety features will include things like the inability to tailgate change lanes within a certain distance of another car and only being able to drive over the speed limit for limited periods insurance companies will be behind it but youll have legislators talking about public safety and using accident stats as reasoning
792,the accident thing would be great or negligence problem i acknowledge that there are diving situations and factors that create genuine accidents but there are many that happen do to ignorant people doing dumb illegal shit if they can take over there self driving car anytime they want im sure accidents will still happen last night i nearly t boned a girl making an illegal u turn and she came out of nowhere cut me off and was in front of me mid turn i have a sports car and if it wasnt a good in terms of handling and brakes or if i wasnt paying attentionlooking up at in that moment forget about it id have crashed into her i legit had to brake hard not fully thats how good the brakes were and still move to the right to avoid it i was dumbstruck a part of me want to hit her after the fact because based on her making an illegal u turn and causing an accident that would have been a huge financial blow more to them than me unfortunately i didnt have my dash cam installed yet so it was better i avoided it and i also didnt want to damage my new car but it makes me angry they got away with such a dumbass stunt and not getting the fines she most definitely deserves also incredibly bummed i didnt get the footage im not gonna lie it was exemplary in my part and could have been used as an education tool i am very proud of myself sorry i had to rant a bit its still very fresh in my head and i needed to vent
793,the accident thing would be great or negligence problem i acknowledge that there are diving situations and factors that create genuine accidents but there are many that happen do to ignorant people doing dumb illegal shit if they can take over there self driving car anytime they want im sure accidents will still happen last night i nearly t boned a girl making an illegal u turn and she came out of nowhere cut me off and was in front of me mid turn i have a sports car and if it wasnt a good in terms of handling and brakes or if i wasnt paying attentionlooking up at in that moment forget about it id have crashed into her i legit had to brake hard not fully thats how good the brakes were and still move to the right to avoid it i was dumbstruck a part of me want to hit her after the fact because based on her making an illegal u turn and causing an accident that would have been a huge financial blow more to them than me unfortunately i didnt have my dash cam installed yet so it was better i avoided it and i also didnt want to damage my new car but it makes me angry they got away with such a dumbass stunt and not getting the fines she most definitely deserves also incredibly bummed i didnt get the footage im not gonna lie it was exemplary in my part and could have been used as an education tool i am very proud of myself sorry i had to rant a bit its still very fresh in my head and i needed to vent
794,look forward to when self driving cars are the norm so accidents drop to virtually zero so cars are designed with comfort and entertainment in mind im worried that wont happen in our life times too many people are so invested in driving the cars themselves while humans are still on the road we are still going to need humans behind the wheel of self driving cars because only a human can understand how fucking stupid a human can be you know how old people are with tech someone is going to smash their car because it took a different route to the one they are used to some boomer is going to refuse to update their car and then blame the tech when they get hit with a zero day that has been known about for years we still havent managed to ween most people of wiping chemicals on thinly sliced tree as a means of communication
795,yeah thats the one gripe i have with all this it fixes a problem that could be fixed way better or creative without cars even in an electric car driving by yourself is still somewhat of a waste puts more pressure on the environment in terms of materials asphalt and small particles from your tires and the production process of you energy also youd need to rework the entire infrastructure for this to work you need even more dracononic laws than the ones you have around jaywalking and countries with a cycling culture will have the dilemma of either creating barriers for them or allowing wildcards on the road a city like amsterdam is a nightmare for cars like that because of the unpredictability still the current mortality rate on bycicles is quite low and mostly concerns elderly who fall and then die of injuries i fully support the plan to have self driving cars become the norm on freeways but i just hope we can think about other stuff than cars
796,just like a bus only it smells less like clifford the big red dog died in the luggage compartment around the same time you last thought about clifford the big red dog and without the probably racist guy that wont stop hitting on me that im afraid to call out for fear hell turn violent or rifle through my duffel the next time i have to take a leak and with lights that i can turn off and it doesnt stop every hour to take on and disgorge human flotsam oh and i can control the ac and the movies and all the surfaces arent coated in a residue so stubbornly sticky that m probably patented it before i was born but yeah otherwise just like a bus if your car is that much like a bus you either dont live in the us or you have the cleaning habits of the average meth addled wildebeest
797,tesla will tell you themselves its not a fucking self driving car you can treat it like such but if a crash happens the car was driving isnt going to work out well for you
798,yeah it needs so much more work the implementation has to be perfect or a lot of people will die that takes a long long time we all want it and it cant come soon enough
799,where do you pull that figure from maybe not the best source but this says electrekcotesla q vehicle safety report autopilot the overall average is on accident per miles and autopilot is per mil with human tesla drivers being per mil taken at face value autopilot is x safer than the average driver or safer than a human tesla driver if it has less accidents than a human what is the issue
800,without any malice youre factually incorrect there was some controversy because tesla did falsely claim they reduced crashes by but even within the articles pointing out that that was an exaggeration its explained that it was still safer than human drivers and tesla has improved the tech since im not claiming a corporation is suddenly perfect and blowing elon musk but human drivers are just so terrible and technology doesnt get tired blink drink text or just generally get distracted or do one of the other billion things humans do while driving
801,without any malice youre factually incorrect there was some controversy because tesla did falsely claim they reduced crashes by but even within the articles pointing out that that was an exaggeration its explained that it was still safer than human drivers and tesla has improved the tech since im not claiming a corporation is suddenly perfect and blowing elon musk but human drivers are just so terrible and technology doesnt get tired blink drink text or just generally get distracted or do one of the other billion things humans do while driving
802,people have always fell asleep in their cars but rarely have they done it so recklessly usually its someone late at night driving for hours with little sleep not someone on their min commute to work not to mention its not a self driving car and the auto pilot will disengage for lots of reasons and he would wind up crashing anyways just a matter of time before it happens the auto pilot requires you to interact with the steering wheel every few minutes or so but it can be cheated rather easily often people place fruit in the steering wheel or other objects that fool the system theres plenty of videos on youtube demonstrating this
803,well said people think its just a simple problem the average age of a trucker is like lets assume that by the time huge layoffs happen it goes up to like do people really think its practical for a year old dude with a hs degreeged who has been working as a trucker for like years to just go to college for years then get a job in programming whos gonna hire a year old programmer with little to no experience when they can hire a year old who has an education years of experience and grew up with the stuff thats just truckers taxi drivers bus drivers mail carriers and so on are all at risk hell boston dynamics has robots that do warehouse work give it a decade and those jobs will be obsolete now you have s of millions of middle aged people with no higher education or marketable skill unemployed not everyone can code
804,the article states with something tied around the steering wheel this is a known cheat to their checks to see if the driver is actively paying attention it use to be just putting some type of ball or fruit would be good enough now you have to go to a few extra steps to accomplish what the driver is doing he is actively choosing to do this and ignoring all safety concernsissues associated with it assuming the risks that it could deactivate its not like he randomly fell asleep he planned this out and set it up in advanced so that he could fall asleep youre speculating and throwing random scenarios into this equation the driver would not have gone to this level of trouble if there was no auto pilot therefore he would not of been sleeping hes knowingly risking himself and others to a fatal crash at the very least it spreads ignorance about what this type of car is capable of at this time its not ready for drivers to be sleeping
805,how do you know i speed its heavily implied in your original comment that you wouldnt want a self driving car because it wouldnt speed when you wake up late for work and my minute drive needs to be even if you dont speed youre effectively saying that speeding is ok by what you said thats a really really stupid reckless thing to be saying because its blatantly not true no you shouldnt speed no i have never sped no self driving cars wont speed because they shouldnt because speeding fucking kills people you needing to be somewhere fast doesnt justify you endangering lives the rules are there for a reason fuck your personal reasons youre putting lives at risk every time you speed and i hope you get your license taken away if you do if you got up late thats your own stupid fault fix your alarm or get a better one you cant endanger others to save your own ass selfish grow up and take responsibility for the mistakes you make rather than endangering others house on fire thats what the fire brigade is for youre not gonna fight the fire yourself nor will you get there in time call and drive at the speed limit same with the school shooting are you picturing yourself going in and saving the day vigilante style get over yourself you cant save anyone in time by the time you got word of the shooting then the drive to get there even if you speed it will be over call drive at the speed limit labour takes hours to complete assuming your wife makes it to the hospital well before you even if the contractions start and you dont get notified for a whole hour you still have a minimum of about hours to make it sometimes it can last up to hours youre in no rush youll make it in time drive at the speed limit in all of these situations youve mentioned you either dont need to speed or you should have left earlier if you get a speeding ticket its deserved and your fault you dont deserve to drive if you cant respect the rules they are there for a reason
806,worked in insurance for years made it to lower senior management in two global corporations and have a diploma in insurance really im a totally interesting and swell guy who absolutely didnt own several different shades of grey suit honest im going to say on this one that i disagree an insurance company is in the business of lowering risk exposure against premium charged in order to increase their profit margin essentially the less they have to pay out the better sometimes they do this with good advice to the customer based on their knowledge of what likely causes of loss are particularly type of door lock or burglar alarm works better they will advise you fit it and can lower your premium accordingly they know with those youre less likely to have a loss and they get to keep more premium across the pool of risks they insure every year anyway currently to insure a car they have to assess individual drivers ability lifestyle carelessness decision making skills location commute type of parking level of car usage type of use and experience some they can ask you some they can use big data to figure the trends but in a lot of cases they simply cant know as much about you as you know about you so their premium charged has to guess and factor that in i worked on multiple books of motor insurance that had a combined operating ratio money in verses money out of over you need less than to be making money and these were the big insurance companies with the really good systems low operating costs internal efficiencies and damn good actuaries in the uk the motor industry lost money every year for over a decade i dont know the stats these daystheyd make up for it in other areas for an insurance company where in the uk it is compulsory for a driver to have at least third party liability to cover you damaging other things or people theres simply a lot of stuff that you the driver could do that they cant account for in their numbers but will have to pay for if you screwed up but an automatic car not owned by an individual but by company trying to run a profit themselves with known software and hardware combinations known and predictable use cases secure storage facilities regular maintenance and user feedback reporting and a large data set provided by the company themselves that reports all incidents and not just the ones that the drivers do actually report thats going to lead to a much more predictable loss data set and you have a company to sue when it goes wrong suing a regular person for the money they dont have can be a hiding to nothing so the way i see it insurance companies cant wait to get their hands on the business model of automated drive and fleet pool car operations where the unknown human element is a much more manageable in the insurance press its been a topic of discussion for years with some people actually thinking the biggest resistance wont come from the insurance companies but from the population resisting having their freedom to drive taken away from them and from governments that will be slow to unpack the current insurance legislation and open it up to allow innovation in the market the insurance companies want more money for their shareholders they often do it by slicing the back end operation which i in operations hated them for it made people their own staff have worse quality lives all so the shareholders could benefit paying less in claims is a much much more lucrative option and may even stop them for a while from carving into themselves for the extra cash i think they want the automation they wont resist it its way too much good money
807,i wouldnt say that i work for a large insurer and im aware that theyre actively looking at how these type of vehicles will be rated think of it this wayautonomous vehicles still have to be insured maybe there are less vehicles overall way down the line but in the short term people still like to drive recreationally accidents of one kind or another still occur the vehicles still need to be maintained and repaired and theres risk in those activities as well that shop owners will want coverage
808,love it big insurance will fight it to the death instead of evolving with it and actually promoting safer transportation you have it backwards insurance pushes more car safety than government because it saves them money they dont ever lower their rates so self driving cars with virtually no accidents will be a profit windfall
809,big insurance will fight it to the death no theyll love it youll still need insurance for cars but with fewer crashes it would mean more free money for them sure some competition between car insurance companies but they will stay profitable theyll only start whining once the system changes completely and we really end up abolishing the need for car insurance when they are actually going to be obsolete
810,big insurance will fight it to the death no theyll love it youll still need insurance for cars but with fewer crashes it would mean more free money for them sure some competition between car insurance companies but they will stay profitable theyll only start whining once the system changes completely and we really end up abolishing the need for car insurance when they are actually going to be obsolete
811,shit i was trying hard to pretend to be an american i said dollars and everything i accidentally outed myself
812,will you pay a penalty if you are late in getting out of the house depends on your package i guess whole rainbow of option no penalty package or a strike package eventually an industry standard will appear i think people themselves would adapt though youd just click the im ready button and itll divert the nearest one to you you dont need to be out the door specifically at am for example i think distribution of ready vehicles especially in rural locations would be a nightmare yup this hits the nail on the head the whole system lives and dies on the success of this but with computers and the internet i think its solvable
813,crashing is my biggest fear about human driving cars
814,i know that a self driving car is exponentially more capable of avoiding an accident than i am
815,i want to die in new orleans
816,my only fear would be crashing into a body of water at night especially if my last conscious thought was setting it for new orleans waking up to that would be too much
817,but then theres the question if a self driving car only has options go onto the curb and hit a pedestrian or slam into the back of a car what will it choose either way someone gets hurt but i dont know if i would want a machine deciding who gets hurt the scenario is of course possible however getting to that scenario will be x more rare with self driving cars they arent going to put themselves in those situations nearly as much theyve got x better reaction speeds can see x further and eventually will be able to communicate with other cars on the road as well there will come a time when a car will jerk hard to the right in the middle of highway traffic because someone just jumped off or threw something off the overpass and as it swerves into the other lane that lane is already clear because the car that was occupying that space got the message and itself slowed down and swerved to make room for your car avoiding it and all the cars for feet behind it also adapt their paths and suddenly start navigating around the obstacle or person in the road while automatically alerting ems or police the exact location with a picture of whats happening and all these vehicles will do all those things faster than you as a person could even register with our tiny little monkey brains that something was falling into the road any fears i ever had about a car making these decisions were soothed the first time i saw a compliation of self driving cars avoiding accidents i just put myself in the position of the driver and think how would i have handled this would i have crashed and the car is reacting before i can even suss out whats happening on screen or see anything

819,i acknowledge that there are diving situations and factors that create genuine accidents but there are many that happen do to ignorant people doing dumb illegal shit sure but a self driving car is better than a human at dealing with those people too p all the stuff you had to do and the things that had to go right for you to miss having an accident last night the autonomous car would have started handling faster seen coming from further away and reacted better and more safely accidents will still happen until we outlaw humans from public roads which is going to come because humans are terrible at driving but self driving cars will reduce those accidents and the severity of them dramatically
820,why would insurance be through the roof on a car that never crashes i work for an insurance agency and my boss thinks that auto insurance as an industry is about to get squished by autonomous vehicles removing the need for any kind of liability coverage maybe year to protect from vandalismnature otherwise whos going to hit you who are you going to hit no coverage needed kthnxbye

822,insurance rates being insanely more expensive once its proven that autopilot mean way more safety and less accidents will put an end to that
823,mmm tasty chlorophyll it is tough to get a balanced diet with the ca dessert
824,now that you have high speed internet do you feel you have a certain obligation to to think youre right about everything you texted several paragraphs basically proving my point to speed only reason they seem wrong and or dont apply you to those scenarios will never happen to you you dont work no need to speed to work no house have burn down that you care about because you live with your mother and youll go live with your father who you hate because he makes you go outside no wife in labor or kids to worry about getting shot because you arent liked enough to have a partner to have kids in the us the top speed limit is prob why does every car have a top governed speed of at least how do i pass a car in the acceleration lane without speeding your great grandfather has an hour left to live you a hour away you aint gonna try to make it prob not because he didnt like you anyway nobody should speed because it kills cops speed ems speeds fire trucks speeds race car drivers speed keanu reeves speed
825,if youre a self employed farmerlumberjackrancher in the us the lines between work vehicle and personal vehicle get blurry pretty quick id say theyre more often than not one and the same plus some times you haul things even if they arent work related i knew a programmer who happened to heat his house with a wood stove in the winter and every year wed help him haul and split wood came in handy one winter when the gas line into town broke and we were able to crash at his place sorurce grew up in rural wisconsin
826,ill give you itll be like modern hotel issues i was thinking the smaller more enclosed spaces would make this different but it doesnt they could purge the air and the cars could steam themselves to kill everything without chemicals ok sign me up
827,someone crashing into me is my biggest fear about human piloted cars
828,im always amazed with people worried about the robots crashing of the people youll pass on the way home today will be texting and driving there are year olds who can barely get their socks on allowed to operate a ton death machine ill take the robot risks any day
829,i think it was a mistake to not nationalize our train system privatization is what killed our trains
830,me personally id rather have the freedom of driving myself even if it meant an increased chance of death or injury i know that seems silly to some but the fun and satisfaction i get from driving would outweigh the risk true that a self driving car would have prevented the accident sooner but i still prevented it if i couldnt have fully it would have just been a very survivable accident with little to no injury only a moderate fender bender the wrong doer would have benefited more than i because i saved her from hundreds if not thousands of costs in damages and insurance by stopping in time on top of that i felt like a fucking legend after the adrenaline wore off and very proud of my actions or reactions i should say i mean ive avoided accidents before but this one was on another level also how much do you reckon mandated self driving cars would cost certainly not everyone that can afford to drive a car today can afford one its gonna be hard fought to outlaw driving unless its an autopiloted vehicle again i agree with your take on ap cars but the world be live in today thats not readily attainable for most if it were that driver would have never made that illegal u turn unless they disengage ap and manually took over
831,supply and demand still works with people doesnt it with a huge well educated labour force and a relatively small number of jobs that require highly specific skills you just get a high turnover rate instead of workers rights so burnout doesnt really matter or am i totally wrong
832,i knew a programmer who happened to heat his house with a wood stove in the winter and every year wed help him haul and split wood came in handy one winter when the gas line into town broke and we were able to crash at his place programmers know how every modern piece of technology is built by the lowest bidder and shipped out before its ready so theyd rather do it themselves lol
833,this has almost happened to me twice in the last week a jeep tried to merge into my lane while not looking at mph on thursday thankfully there was nobody in the lane to my left and i managed to not spin out and die and then tonight my wife and i were driving home from my sisters place and someone pulled over and tried to pull back left immediately both very narrow misses
834,im a great driver never been in an accident except when an asswad in the mcdonalds parking lot decided it was taking too long and backed out onto the hood of my car but my cousin and her whole family were in a head on collision on a lane highway when some kid swerved across the line my family was beaten up a bunch but ok the kid who swerved died on impactever since then im super cautiousparanoid on lane highways

836,humans fuck up like all the damn time also we only have two eyes that can only focus in one direction at a time a self driving car has like cameras some have infrared or lasers to detect other vehicles and objects in fucking fog and other atmosphericenvironmental conditions including the constant environmental condition of dumbasses like cletus who thinks a little rain re downpour doesnt warrant turning on his lights conditions no human can see through or should attempt to drive in the problem is you get idiots who see one self driving crash even at no fault of the car itself and say see look they are so dangerous no grandma youre fucking dangerous with your failing eyesight muscles and heart conditions that make you a ticking time bomb on the road but nobodys trying to shut you down
837,if we have accidents by self driving cars every year thats still _way_ less than the number caused by human driven cars in a year
838,my parents retired and live out of an rv for now they definitely dont do long drives in a single day maybe just a couple hundred miles at a time solar would probably be great for keeping the house batteries topped up but i wouldnt imagine you could depend on them realistically youd need the diesel generator that it already has for something like the bmw range extender system i do think an rv based off the tesla semi would be sweet though
839,rural areas here in europe are also more car centric because thats just how how it is in low density areas but bigger us cities have no excuse for the lack of well working public transportation releasescb html rural areas cover percent of the nations land area but contain percent of the population about million people for about of the population whatever one needs to adjust to get realistic numbers good public transportation would be more of a life changer than self driving electric cars that can increase mobility and make life easier in a lot of instances it also means you need fewer parking lots and because there are fewer cars on the road you also get fewer accidents if you dont have self driving car saturation and cleaner air there are people andor jobs that really depend on cars but for the rest of us and also for those few who really need cars a well working public transportation system is much more useful a developed country is not a place where the poor have cars its where the rich use public transportation gustavo petro mayor of bogotá
840,cops do speed without sirens get out your basement ems does speed without sirens go outside fire trucks also speeddo you even google bing yahoo web crawl you didnt mention how am i supposed to pass someone in the acceleration lane without speeding you didnt answer about your great grandfather your not gonna try and hear his sweet voice one last time why am i the only person gonna die from speeding if you listen closely you can hear ricky bobby tearing up talladega if you aint st your last how fast do i have to be going to be considered speeding does the actual increased speed during driving mean more kills

842,lol i have hundreds of random comments across tons of various reddit subs and yet youre still cant help yourself but the scream at me like i killed your dog and accuse me of saying things i never have and existing here solely to attack the op wheres your head at man oh yeah rabidly seething at me and confirming my thesis crazy zealots will do crazy crazy things to defend something they love go drive your autopilot around andor take a nap just not at the same time
843,i optioned blindspot monitoringalerting on my new car to help with this in all honesty though it should be standard on new cars same with auto emergency braking no replacement for paying attention but can help avoid accidents caused by momentary brain farts
844,seems like a good problem to have organ donation is great but far better that people donating dont die in the first place
845,it sucks for prior waiting lists but its better that fewer people are dying in car crashes
846,it sucks for prior waiting lists but its better that fewer people are dying in car crashes
847,out of curiosity what percentage of needed organ transplants are because of injuries sustained during car crashes
848,out of curiosity what percentage of needed organ transplants are because of injuries sustained during car crashes
849,just program a probability into self driving cars of to die in a fatal car accident each time you drive and the problem is fixed

851,my sister was declared brain dead yesterday after an auto accident she is a donor the doctors say that her organs and tissues will help a lot of people its helped to know that even more lives might be made better because of her i wish i had spent more time with her
852,doesnt sound bad to me what im going to say might shock a lot of people and i realise its really hard to say it and im not saying it lightly but id rather have people with sick organs or genetical problems dying because they cant have organs donated instead of more likely healthy people dying in car accidents either way people die wed better devellop artificial organs to save the others instead of expecting people to die to save others

854,not quite nobody is seriously pursuing self driving motorcycles edit the reason motorcycles matter is because of the kinds of accidents that they are involved in and the motorcycle riders who are in fatal accidents tend to be younger and healthier a coroner once told me that above about kmh the only thing motorcycle helmets do is make identification easier
855,well this is definitely a problem that is a few decades away because even when auto automobiles hit the market it will take a while for old cars to cycle out and be completely erased by self driving cars think about it if i go out and buy a self driving car my old car isnt going to just disappear someone else is going to buy it used and continue to drive it interestingly if driving a regular car makes you more prone to an accident and therefore more likely to be an organ donor poorer people who cant afford the new self driving cars will become the primary organ donors
856,we should also realize that somebody died for a part of them to be harvested if the person driving never died then now you have at least one person who is gaurenteed to continue a healthy life whereas the organ recipient would still have a long and risky road to recovery if the driver did die hell if the driver died his body could still be unuseable due to the nature of the crash net gain

858,maybe this will spur advancements in syntheticlab grown organ development if i understand correctly donor organs come with a number of complications and recipients have a high mortality and morbidity rate i feel for the people who need a replacement organ but i still think a lower accidental death rate feels like a big win for society
859,hmmm any idea how many people who need donated organs need them due to a car accident could fewer car crashes also reduce demand
860,hmmm any idea how many people who need donated organs need them due to a car accident could fewer car crashes also reduce demand
861,hmmm any idea how many people who need donated organs need them due to a car accident could fewer car crashes also reduce demand
862,yeah but how many people in need of new organs come from vehicular accidents
863,an interesting way of saying that less people will die
864,dont those crashes also create people that need organs due to injury
865,dont those crashes also create people that need organs due to injury
866,how many of those people who need organs are in a situation where they need them because of a vehicle crash in the first place
867,id like to know how many organ recipients require them due to car accidents
868,how can we save lives if others dont die in the first place
869,also less transplants would be needed because there would be less near fatal accidents
870,any business model that involves hope people die needs to be reworked look at all the genxers who thought their boomer parents would be dead by now
871,but wouldnt the demand of organ donors also drop as there will be less car accidents
872,self driving cars wont kill enough people maybe we should get rid of seat belts and airbags how many people should we be killing each year to make slate happy
873,how the hell are we supposed to prepare for this create a new way to accidentally kill people
874,how the hell are we supposed to prepare for this create a new way to accidentally kill people
875,implying that selfdriving cars wont cause or wont be involved in accidents
876,but if the cars are safer there will be less accidents and thus less requirement on organs right
877,id gladly keep the that die in car accidents every year in the united states and perhaps start a public awareness program to get people to sign up to be organ donors instead
878,id gladly keep the that die in car accidents every year in the united states and perhaps start a public awareness program to get people to sign up to be organ donors instead
879,thats seriously suggesting that its bad that more will die of natural causes because less people would die from horrible accidents thats a good problem to have seeing as organ failure is much more natural and peaceful than sudden fender through the brain syndrome
880,thats seriously suggesting that its bad that more will die of natural causes because less people would die from horrible accidents thats a good problem to have seeing as organ failure is much more natural and peaceful than sudden fender through the brain syndrome
881,we could just do what a lot of places do and make organ donation the default as well as educate people that becoming an organ donor wont give doctots incentive to let you die on the operating table
882,why does the self driving car concept attract pro death psychopaths so often last time it was if we dont program them to kill people it will be the end of functional traffic patterns forever jaywalking will end the world i just chill out self driving cars arent going to end mortality
883,not everyone who dies from a car wreck is an organ donor this is a terrible article
884,for sure we should start killing off more people so we can save people that are already dying wait
885,this is like the biggest first world problem ever not enough people are going to die to donate to the people that will die
886,this will be a good opportunity for the d printed organ market there will also be fewer people needing organs since they wont be getting maimed in car accidents if this is the one of the traditional auto industrys best arguments against self driving cars its a weak argumement
887,this article hahahaha lets write an article about how it is a problem that people dont die anymore d this should be linked as an prime example for bad journalism instead on focusing how a large number of car accidents will be prevented and a lot of healthy people survive focusing on a by far lesser number of people that doesnt get organs and isnt most of the time anyway that healthy from those people
888,this article hahahaha lets write an article about how it is a problem that people dont die anymore d this should be linked as an prime example for bad journalism instead on focusing how a large number of car accidents will be prevented and a lot of healthy people survive focusing on a by far lesser number of people that doesnt get organs and isnt most of the time anyway that healthy from those people
889,theres a lot of unforeseen things that driverless cars will bring i have two friends who work in injury and insurance law they say of their cases are car accidents expect push back from sociopaths whod rather pad their pocket than save thousands of lives
890,rather than worry about less accidents which is a good thing why dont they just boost research into growing organs from peoples own stem cells seems more productive long term
891,given that people who die in car crashes are typically healthy and that the average organ recipient has limited longevity regardless this is excellent news this means an increase in net longevity for people in countries with self driving cars this is a strange article in that its published by a progressive website whose interest would be expected to be in favor of cleaner and safer mass transport authorities yet here it is with conflicts of interest in an article which doesnt examine its own context

894,just program them to have a chance of crashing the government probably already cant wait to start causing certain people to have accidents
895,just program them to have a chance of crashing the government probably already cant wait to start causing certain people to have accidents
896,there would be a little bit of a decrease in the demand for organ donations though if people arent getting in accidents though right i am sure the majority of the demand are for diseased people and not for vehicular accident victims but still
897,im sorry but if this is the worst problem to come out of self driving cars significantly lower fatalities caused by car accidents im fine with that
898,they want people to die from car crashes so they can have the organs
899,they want people to die from car crashes so they can have the organs
900,they want people to die from car crashes so they can have the organs
901,ok fine but surely fewer people dying in car accidents is better than occasionally someone who needs an organ not getting one
902,seems like another moot point to be against electric cars oh they dont make a noise though oh they look stupid but they have limited range the more electric cars on the road the safer the road is thus less car crashes thus less organ donations
903,seems like another moot point to be against electric cars oh they dont make a noise though oh they look stupid but they have limited range the more electric cars on the road the safer the road is thus less car crashes thus less organ donations
904,tldr we need to find a new way of killing healthy organ donors en masse
905,in a few years rich guy in an hospital waiting for an organ an sos is sent and the next second a car crashes the passengers die and the car reaches the hospital
906,in a few years rich guy in an hospital waiting for an organ an sos is sent and the next second a car crashes the passengers die and the car reaches the hospital
907,in a few years rich guy in an hospital waiting for an organ an sos is sent and the next second a car crashes the passengers die and the car reaches the hospital
908,mandatory helmet laws had the same affect fewer brain dead accident victims means fewer donors
909,so how many organ recipients out of five are injured in a vehicle accident
910,i would think that preventative measures improving diet providing better medical care to the poor etc would be preferable to an organ market where organs are bought and sold
911,healthy people wont be dying as much to needless crashes how unfortunate first world problems indeed
912,healthy people wont be dying as much to needless crashes how unfortunate first world problems indeed
913,if we are against self driving vehicles because that means less people will die there is something fundamentally wrong with our thinking
914,oh no less people dying will cause more people to die this seems like an unsolvable problem almost like death is some inevitable thing we all must do
915,if demand gets that high they could start selling extreme sport and manually operated vehicle insurance the cost your organs when you die and maybe like admin fee
916,are you saying that we need more healthy people to die in car crashes so people in poor health can take their organs and live a little longer
917,are you saying that we need more healthy people to die in car crashes so people in poor health can take their organs and live a little longer
918,are you saying that we need more healthy people to die in car crashes so people in poor health can take their organs and live a little longer
919,not a bad problem to have i mean literally thats what donnation means i dont need it anymore compare that to the situation of charities that report because so many people scam online there are less and less people willing to donate online the general idea was we have unneccesary deaths people die one from a gunshot wound to the head the other one from a missing liver translant lets cut that short by taking the otherwise still useable gunshot victims liver and sowing it into the other patients body we can save one of them guaranteed the idea was never we have a right to those organ numbers we have a right to now demand those organs the idea was never we now get to complain because large numbers of organs are not there where we need them the general idea is innovate your way out of this for example allow some donors to decide for themself how their organs will be used for example i myself would have no problems with my organs being donnated to a poor schlob who never won anything to specify that if my reccipient has plans like climb mount everrest ride the bike or have an active and healthy social life go tell him to fck himself and prioritise the bottom of the list these people whom you wouldnt trust with a fresh vegan liver give them my liver put a smile on their faces shit on the guy who plans to run with the bulls or who has an instagramm account donnate your heart to the bottom of the transplant waiting list your liver to an recovering alcoholic your skin to someone who looks like a two and otherwise would need skingrafts from their own ass and your dick to someone who put chronic masturbation under hobbies let my shit go to people who actually appreciate it not take it for granted i could see a lot of people out of their free will donnating their organs and actually feeling good about it skin blood liver shit i take it like with the computer if anything can be reused before you toss it into the biohazard bin and burry it in an abandoned mineshaft be my gust grab what you need to when it is clear that i dont need it anymore just dont give it to the prick with the hope and stars in their eyes give it to themiserable bastard that has never won anything and make them for once feel like they own the world the downside would be that you would actually have to respect those wishes and such you know i will not be around to check anymore but i am sure it would be a hoot to tell mister schmidt from b that the medical board has a heart for him even though the medical board cant legally give that heart to anyone else but too often when a board decides who gets the organs and who gets a second chance i wanna wipe the smug grins off of their faces and go yea she ugly as fuck but shes a two so the rmeistermalkav clause grips and she gets his skin yes all of it see what she needs cut off the rest make a trendy bag out of it and this is where i see the problem the doctors would never agree to actually respect the donors wishes and hand over their power they would allways push for this little bit of extra of finger waving of such and of course there would be the the people that go i want my body parts to go to someone who is white i know it is harsh but better then publically whining about how fewer transplants we will have because more and more people will surive would be to take the good with the bad just increase the numbers every racist bastard who gets his wish means one fewer place on that list needing to be filled an other option would be medically assisted suicide i am dead serious on that one if all you care is get places of of that list go fuck your ethics board untill they bleed from both ends and offer assisted suicide have a suicide coaster in the back that kills you in a painless safe and guaranteed way in exchange for the right to harvest the organs of course respect these peoples wishes what they want to be done with the organs and the grafts but in the end if you are good enough to whine publically about the list let me remind you that if you pushed for harvesting rights to suicide victims bodies your numbers would look quite different yes there would be the option about not doing harm but that could be done with a patient activated mechanism or and this would be my preferred option actually look into technology look into artificial hearts look into stem cell research and make sure all your people on that waiting list understand that if they vote the people against stem cell research out of office they may actually do the world a bigger favor then by leaving them in and just signing up to be donors just you know become single issue voters for an election my best case only hand the advertising contracts to inform about organ donnations to people who are donors make fun fact sheets allow me to specify my wsh that nobody who is an sjw should get anything from me but if there is any miserable sick son of a bitch that is just a grouch give him my body and tell him to toast me once in a while staple it in and see how it goes use what you can from my body and go fuck your ethics board if you can get it out of my body without retching uncontrollably you are entitled to have it if any of my body ends up in an art project go buy a big pack of smokes for the nearest smoker and tell him my story but i would rather rot completely intact underground and make sure maggots and shit get my body then go to the afterlife with the secure knowledge that my bodyparts are taken for granted and to be distributed as seen fit by a team of medical experts

wishes and hand over their power they would allways push for this little bit of extra of finger waving of such and of course there would be the the people that go i want my body parts to go to someone who is white i know it is harsh but better then publically whining about how fewer transplants we will have because more and more people will surive would be to take the good with the bad just increase the numbers every racist bastard who gets his wish means one fewer place on that list needing to be filled an other option would be medically assisted suicide i am dead serious on that one if all you care is get places of of that list go fuck your ethics board untill they bleed from both ends and offer assisted suicide have a suicide coaster in the back that kills you in a painless safe and guaranteed way in exchange for the right to harvest the organs of course respect these peoples wishes what they want to be done with the organs and the grafts but in the end if you are good enough to whine publically about the list let me remind you that if you pushed for harvesting rights to suicide victims bodies your numbers would look quite different yes there would be the option about not doing harm but that could be done with a patient activated mechanism or and this would be my preferred option actually look into technology look into artificial hearts look into stem cell research and make sure all your people on that waiting list understand that if they vote the people against stem cell research out of office they may actually do the world a bigger favor then by leaving them in and just signing up to be donors just you know become single issue voters for an election my best case only hand the advertising contracts to inform about organ donnations to people who are donors make fun fact sheets allow me to specify my wsh that nobody who is an sjw should get anything from me but if there is any miserable sick son of a bitch that is just a grouch give him my body and tell him to toast me once in a while staple it in and see how it goes use what you can from my body and go fuck your ethics board if you can get it out of my body without retching uncontrollably you are entitled to have it if any of my body ends up in an art project go buy a big pack of smokes for the nearest smoker and tell him my story but i would rather rot completely intact underground and make sure maggots and shit get my body then go to the afterlife with the secure knowledge that my bodyparts are taken for granted and to be distributed as seen fit by a team of medical experts
921,so medical professionals were content with people dying in horrible automobile accidents because of the consistent organ supply now that the supply may be interrupted we must act with urgency what a horrible industry
922,its better for our species to have the sick and feeble die from their illnesses than give them the organs from healthy individuals who died in a preventable accident
923,its better for our species to have the sick and feeble die from their illnesses than give them the organs from healthy individuals who died in a preventable accident
924,ok just pointing out the obvious here but wouldnt a lot less people need organs if car accidents werent a thing
925,when can we just grow our own test tube organs so we dont have people whining about not enough car accident victims donating organs
926,seriously reddit i never thought someone would be able to find the negative in declines in car accident deaths
927,self driving cars will make organ shortages even worse we need to prepare for that now vs we need to prepare for even worse organ shortages since self driving cars wont kill you
928,well we can start killing and harvesting republicans in a couple of years we might have a better world
929,maybe we can d print an organ as if it was in a crash
930,car accidents also increase the need for organ replacements aswell surely
931,so the lesson here is we need people to die needlessly in auto accidents in order to save lives with their organs
932,so the lesson here is we need people to die needlessly in auto accidents in order to save lives with their organs
933,id rather die from organ failure than a car accident
934,id rather die from organ failure than a car accident
935,but how many people need organ donations due to a car accident
936,but i also feel like theres gotta be a lot of people that need organs because of a car crash eg self driving cars would prevent us from needing so many organ donations i have zero data to back this up and could very well be wrong
937,but less people will need organs because there will be fewer car accidents
938,maybe we can work in some kind of lottery algorithm to randomly have a fatal accident to maintain the flow of organs factor in the different wait lists blood types and likely compatibility of vehicle passengers just to make sure we dont end up with a shortage of one type of organ and a surplus of another im sorry its the wee hours of the morning and i cant sleep ill be quiet now
939,self driving cars will exacerbate organ shortages unless we start killing more people in car crashes how can we possibly blame safer cars for this problem i dont think the solutions mentioned in this article are good enough we should address the common and preventable cause of disease that warrant transplant elimination of tobacco smoking abuse of alcohol abuse of narcotics
940,self driving cars will exacerbate organ shortages unless we start killing more people in car crashes how can we possibly blame safer cars for this problem i dont think the solutions mentioned in this article are good enough we should address the common and preventable cause of disease that warrant transplant elimination of tobacco smoking abuse of alcohol abuse of narcotics

942,well the person needing the transplant will just have to die rather than the person that would have been in a fatal car accident _ツ_
943,well the person needing the transplant will just have to die rather than the person that would have been in a fatal car accident _ツ_
944,self driving cars will exacerbate organ shortages unless we start preparing now currently in organ donations comes from the victim of a vehicular accident not necessarily since the non official medical term for motorcyclists is organ donor
945,sorrynotsorry i dont see less people dying in car accidents as a fucking problem maybe we should spend more money on medical science and growing organs out of stem cells ok i dont totally get how it works but ive read about it and its a thing but that would mean money had to go to science now where could we get that money hmmm oh maybe if we take away the fucking tax breaks for churches separation of religion and state means religion should not get special treatment by the state
946,but if we keep people from dying then we wont be able to harvest good parts from those dead people to save other dying people modern medicine is horrible people have to die its how life works
947,self driving cars are going to be one of the biggest epitomes of totalitarian orwellian style enslavement in the future the joking comments on here about programming them to crash and kill someone every so often actually isnt far off from what will happen in real life i can almost sense the cognitive dissonance of half sarcasm through my computer screen yes you can bet your ass that the likelihood of an autonomous vehicle mysteriously driving you off of a bridge will be higher if you end up on too many of the governments naughty lists that should be common sense for anyone with a pulse and who doesnt have their head up their ass as for the overall lowering of the mortality rate it would appear that the proponents of driverless cars are missing a very important point that a one in chance of dying due to human error is better than a one in chance of dying due to a computer error its the same reason that people who have no problem driving a car on an mile an hour highway where they know full well that they have a better chance of being killed than in a plane crash are terrified of flying and its for a good reason its not some irrational thought process that goes on in the human mind its about being in control of ones own physical well being which is a right by default it goes hand in hand with the proverb of those who are willing to give up a little freedom for a little security deserve neither and will receive none i liken the push for autonomous vehicles to the war on guns and the war on cash only to the half witted yuppie imbeciles is it about the promotion of things like safety for the common good and convenience for the individual to ignore the obvious dark side is to drink the technocratic cool aid

949,self driving cars will save more lives than the people dying from organ shortages the linked article is suggesting that it is bad that less people are dying from car accidents
950,this might sound dark but now instead of healthy people being killed and used to make unhealthy people live for a portion of the actual life span healthy people will survive and unhealthy people will die naturally
951,this might sound dark but now instead of healthy people being killed and used to make unhealthy people live for a portion of the actual life span healthy people will survive and unhealthy people will die naturally
952,solution is simple just program in cars not to try and avoid an accident chances are well even have an influx of organs to donate good job whoever wrote this article i feel like we are focused on the right things my faith in the human race is renewed
953,dont a lot of them come from motorcycle accidents i highly doubt those will be automated also hopefully by this revolution great strides will be made using stem cell based replacements etc hopefully
954,so we need more people to die in order to save people who are already dying i guess i dont understand the logic here one of two people in the scenario dies either way its just that in the new scenario healthy people arent dying unexpectedly
955,well then i guess the only thing to do is add in some software glitches that will cause in every cars to randomly crash every day to keep up the quotas
956,yes but how many donations are needed because of car accidents in otherwise what is the net change
957,no self driving carswe need people to die for their organs
958,the most bizarre backwards thing ive read in a while so we dont have organs because people die less so we cant heal more people
959,just hack them and have them kill the people inside or something
960,dont worry a group of humans wont follow the self driving cars fad and will vow to kill all those on the road who does
961,is there any technology on earth that does not have bugs freezes and crashes i dont think so and these cars are only in an infant state their confidence is a bit too big
962,is there any technology on earth that does not have bugs freezes and crashes i dont think so and these cars are only in an infant state their confidence is a bit too big
963,what percentage of organ requirements also stem from vehicular accidents is there like person crashes and damages their liver and needs a new liver because of their crash
964,what percentage of organ requirements also stem from vehicular accidents is there like person crashes and damages their liver and needs a new liver because of their crash
965,what percentage of organ requirements also stem from vehicular accidents is there like person crashes and damages their liver and needs a new liver because of their crash
966,so let me get this straight self driving cars will save the lives of the people who are supposed to die to save the life of someone else mind blown
967,its a good thing that with self driving cars scientists will be able to work on their way to work with assistance from ai to create new medicine and artificial organs instead of relying on a random car accident to harvest a donors organs
968,i actually would have thought it was even more than in i always assume that tragic accidents were responsible for over half since those people would have more healthy in life than someone who died of a chronic disease
969,i actually would have thought it was even more than in i always assume that tragic accidents were responsible for over half since those people would have more healthy in life than someone who died of a chronic disease
970,so self driving cars are going to magically never crash this is getting implemented instantly where every car is immediately replaced with a self driving one in the future ill be required to use self driving cars
971,but how many donations are needed because of accidents
972,kill less people in car crashes have more people die from lack of organs pick one
973,kill less people in car crashes have more people die from lack of organs pick one
974,kill less people in car crashes have more people die from lack of organs pick one
975,kill less people in car crashes have more people die from lack of organs pick one
976,but how many organ recipients are victims of car crashes
977,but how many organ recipients are victims of car crashes
978,this is one of the most wonderful unintended consequences ive ever encountered you know who else is going to be hurting from this the funeral industry also automotive repair emergency rooms local law enforcement derived city revenue and both automotive insurance and personal injury lawyers bring on this brave new world i say my boss who i really loved and admired was killed in an mva in september she had stopped along with all traffic in her highway lane as a result of a fender bender several cars ahead of her and another vehicle ran into the back of her at high speed
979,unless we start preparing now sounds like we are going to kill people for their organs
980,there are quite a few problems with self driving cars economically its going to be a huge negative impact jobs be it semi truck to pizza delivery driver is the job title in the us auto body shopswhos going to need them sure accidents will still happen but probably at an enormously lower rate the people that fix cars make parts etc will all be impacted greatly budget municipalities counties and states all write millions of in tickets annually for various traffic infractions how will they make up that budget gap lay off st responders raise property taxes both the benefit of less deaths injuries law suits etc are all good things to me i never even thought of a possible organ shortage and i am sure that we all of us havent thought of all of the other things that self drivings will cause impact and or change for better or worse
981,it will just equal out again someone dies so another lives if that person didnt die in a wreck only one person will still die the person needing the organ the person that didnt die in the wreck continues to live so no need to over think it no more deaths in cars is a goal saving a person that needs a new organ falls on the science community to invent new methods to re grow organs or another option organ donors will no longer be a thing carry on
982,yeah but how many organs are needed due to car accidents seems like it might be a wash
983,really did lol hurry up and die we need spare parts
984,yea like what are we gonna do start killing more people the only thing we can really hope for is an advancement in fake organs and use of non human organs
985,its a special skill to get such bullshit to the front page how do you do it rfutorology the click bait title the useless facts everything is so well put together that im constantly reading the comments and thinking well done youve outdone yesterdays dumb post yet again with an even greater amount of stupidity cant wait to read tomorrows articles hopefully its another miracle cure that is only years away but currently stuck in a rd phase one can hope
986,need info on how many organ donations go to the victims of vehicular accidents if more than in then were good
987,and how many people need these organs after car accidents
988,the number of pedestrians and cyclists killed will even out the shortage nothing to worry about
989,currently in organ donations comes from the victim of a vehicular accident of which the vast majority are bikers which wont go away because of self driving cars
990,all in all less healthy people will die so this is a good thing lets hope we will be able to grow organs in labs or find other ways to transplant organs in the future
991,how many donations are needed because of car crashes
992,how many donations are needed because of car crashes
993,this is stupid we should be hoping more people get into accidents so we can have more organs we should be working on artificial organs so human to human organ transplants become unnecessary we need a ice bucket challenge for artificial organs
994,imwhat i want to know is how many of those people were in need of an organ because of a car crash in the first place
995,looks like prisons just found a way to make a few extra bucks under the table seems familiar somehowhttp alleges china killing thousands of prisoners to harvest organsarticle
996,well how many people need an organ transplant because of an accident involving a vehicle
997,yeah but how many of those people need organs because of car accidents
998,i wonder how many people need organ donations because of vehicular accidents though
999,so we need to find a new way to kill of some people i see you satan
1000,its cost to put a person on a road but its a flaw if any death comes out anything sure seen the ai working an will kill us
1001,its cost to put a person on a road but its a flaw if any death comes out anything sure seen the ai working an will kill us
1002,with the lack of drunk drivers having accidents the quantity of available organs will drop but the quality of organs will increase
1003,dang didnt even thing of the downside to less accidents
1004,this seems a little premature i have all the confidence in the world that we will continue to find ways to kill ourselves
1005,i did not even think about how self driving cars will cause an organ shortage unless someone hacks them and then kills us
1006,so i wonder what the percentage of people who need an organ donation that result from a car crash is i have a feeling that would start to even this out also less people dying in the first place is probably a good thing
1007,lawyer here there is a lot of buzz in the legal community about self driving cars because theyre going to take away two of our largest sources of income oui defense accident litigation i am not complaining less need for lawyers is always a good thing but its a really big external there are going to be a lot of lawyers who will lose a huge amount of their income stream overnight and for small town lawyers who are already scarce in a lot of the country this might actually drive most of them out of business or away from the small town and you do not want to live in a small town that doesnt have access to a lawyer
1008,probably wont be as many people hurt needing organs from having been in car crashes either plus im pretty sure well be d printing organs in the next generation anyway
1009,probably wont be as many people hurt needing organs from having been in car crashes either plus im pretty sure well be d printing organs in the next generation anyway
1010,so this is like an even dumber version of final destination if someone doesnt die in a car wreck he ll be replaced with an organ failure death
1011,my brother received a liver transplant from an individual who died in a car accident was a bitter sweet event its a way for a person to have a lasting legacy passing on their organs to help others im skeptical of the self driving cars to begin with this is a very interesting point thanks for posting op
1012,my brother received a liver transplant from an individual who died in a car accident was a bitter sweet event its a way for a person to have a lasting legacy passing on their organs to help others im skeptical of the self driving cars to begin with this is a very interesting point thanks for posting op
1013,i mean wouldnt it also inversely reduce the need for organs since less people are getting into near fatal car crashes
1014,i mean wouldnt it also inversely reduce the need for organs since less people are getting into near fatal car crashes
1015,wont the need for organs also go down because of less accidents
1016,conspiracy theory self driving cars will be programmed by the government to malfunction of the time and cause deadly crashes in order to harvest the victims organs
1017,conspiracy theory self driving cars will be programmed by the government to malfunction of the time and cause deadly crashes in order to harvest the victims organs
1018,id imagine that car accidents are to an extent a driver sorry of the need for organ transplants what with all the accidents caused by human error the article raises an interesting point though
1019,its so difficult to get an organ when you need it precisely because selling organs is illegal tons of people in need die and a dark blackmarket is created for those who can afford it
1020,this is potentially bad news for recipients who cant be helped with technical solutions although those gaps will close but it also represents many lives often young lives saved the near elimination of auto accidents will usher in many complex changes there is a huge array of businesses services and professions built around what has been a tragic certainty all of them will be forced to change some will all but fade away
1021,many more people die of car accidents than benefit from them if we want to improve organ availability for transplant a more reasonable answer is to make the process opt out instead of opt in this will if other countries results are generalizable increase participation more than x we can have half the accidents and still have twice the organs p
1022,many more people die of car accidents than benefit from them if we want to improve organ availability for transplant a more reasonable answer is to make the process opt out instead of opt in this will if other countries results are generalizable increase participation more than x we can have half the accidents and still have twice the organs p
1023,how about growing organs in a lab using a patients on stem cells hopefully that way the organ doesnt get rejects and no one has to die
1024,theres a simple software based solution for this set up a tracking system that keeps track of the size and wait times of the transplant lists and then randomly crashes cars until the list is at an acceptable wait time
1025,theres a simple software based solution for this set up a tracking system that keeps track of the size and wait times of the transplant lists and then randomly crashes cars until the list is at an acceptable wait time
1026,i wonder how many of those who require organ donations acquired that need in a vehicular accident i imagine its not but it could be a surprisingly large number
1027,as if these cars wont have bugs and crash on their own anyways
1028,speaking from the perspective of someone whose life has been completely fucked over by a car accident sorry for the inconvenience
1029,well luckily for people on the transplant list nobody wants a self driving motorcycle and theres still a large opposition to compulsory helmet laws its morbid but true and no motorcycle fatalities will not be entirely eliminated by the self driving cars around them riding will certainly become safer but iirc the majority of fatal motorcycle accidents are caused by rider error if you ride check the donation box next time you renew your license
1030,we need people to die so that people wont die what bizarre logic
1031,this title seems poorly worded it makes it seem like less people dying from avoidable accidents is going to cause more harm than good
1032,and how many of those waiting on a transplant list are due to not taking care of their bodies properly throughout their lives
1033,so taking into account rejections there will be overall fewer deaths assuming all that die in accidents are organ donors soundsgood statistically
1034,so taking into account rejections there will be overall fewer deaths assuming all that die in accidents are organ donors soundsgood statistically
1035,in a church of euthanasia stance how can we solve the problem of getting more people to die though
1036,kinda weird articlee rather have people live than have to die
1037,i mean were gonna need less organs once people stop getting injured in car accidents
1038,but im sure a lot of those organ donations also go to victims of accidents as well
1039,like this is a fucked argument lol maybe people should look after their first heartkidneyliver and we wouldnt have such a desperate shortage sugargmotobacco ban on weed and affordable natural produce a decaying a rotting public a public who so mentally ill that rather than focus on making the country live healthy would stop innovation so we can continue smoking and drinking until the day we die i think my argument has developed through this comment to become something i never expected but which logic is undeniable ban organ dining now happy new year everybody
1040,i wonder how many people need organs because of a car crash and if there is a correlation
1041,something i am actually scared about i die close enough to a hospital and my organs can not be harvested because of stupid regulationsrelatives etc in my germany where the discussion is tainted by rhetoric about nazism that seems like a sad possibility
1042,lung gets punctured in car accident gets lung from other guy who was in car accident i think it will balance itself out
1043,the sick will die because the healthy will stop killing eachother
1044,the sick will die because the healthy will stop killing eachother
1045,wouldnt you expect to see fewer people needing organ transplants because there would be fewer accidents related to autonomous cars of course there are still plenty of cases of people needing organs for non car accident related incidents but its just a thought
1046,so more people will die because fewer people will die fitting this article came out in
1047,but how many people need organ transplants because of conditions they were left with after an accident maybe they will balance each other out
1048,we need multivac to sort out the statistics and tell us who to kill to save the most lives
1049,what the article doesnt state is how many people from vehicular accidents need an organ donation
1050,did they take a look at the number of people needing donated organs due to being injured in car accidents it could significantly offset this shortage
1051,considering that death by drug overdoses now outnumber automobile crashes guess its problem solved as far as im concerned its a good thing if less healthy people are dying in the first place even if it means less of us will have organs when we get sick watch me regret these words when i need an organ in the future
1052,considering that death by drug overdoses now outnumber automobile crashes guess its problem solved as far as im concerned its a good thing if less healthy people are dying in the first place even if it means less of us will have organs when we get sick watch me regret these words when i need an organ in the future
1053,arent most organ transplants due to health problems caused by poor diet and exercise id say all around we need to do a better job in society of preventative actions to improve health especially for those most disproportionately affected the working poor and the shrinking middle class
1054,people die every day waiting for organ transplants just in the us http transplantfacts and myths vs people killed per day in car accidents just in the us enmwikipediaorgwikilist_of_motor_vehicle_deaths_in_us_by_year i mean we save over times as many people and force more funding into science that studies d printing organs which was going to have to be the inevitable organ transplant method eventually
1055,people die every day waiting for organ transplants just in the us http transplantfacts and myths vs people killed per day in car accidents just in the us enmwikipediaorgwikilist_of_motor_vehicle_deaths_in_us_by_year i mean we save over times as many people and force more funding into science that studies d printing organs which was going to have to be the inevitable organ transplant method eventually

1057,i wonder how many donations go to people involved in car accidents
1058,so the industry should do everything in its power to make sure that driverless cars dont happen in favor of keeping the status quo which is we need accidents to keep happening so we have organs to harvest in order to keep the backlog at a manageable rate this is a morbid thought isnt it that an entire medical industry is based on death to keep the dying alive i wish this moral dilemma on no one especially a parent
1059,we gotta make sure people die or else people will die
1060,but what of people in need of organs need them due to a car crash
1061,looks like were gonna have to start killing people
1062,yeah self driving cars sound like they suck not crashing enough to give dying people organs
1063,getting more transplant is primordial regardless but even if you take for granted self driving cars are going to entirely remove those accidents how long until all regular cars are off the road and donations take a hit
1064,just make it law to remove all background checks and un ban machine guns most people will be blowing their heads off accidentally or someone elses
1065,this is ridiculous to think about we are sad because we will have less organs from people that died to prevent someone from dying it is the same outcome
1066,lets start killing off the weak the terminally and degeneratively ill and use them to sustain the fit
1067,while autonomous vehicles will prevent deaths the drug industry and the opioid crisis is helping add to the organ donation pool sadly as long as young people are killing themselves with carfentanyl then we will be set
1068,now i ask how many people need organ transplants due to vehicular accidents
1069,as long as the solution isnt to let self driving cars crash sometimes to make up for those organs
1070,reducing deaths from accidents by a year is worth more than the lives they would have saved
1071,what about the less demand for organs from people involved in car crashes
1072,what about the less demand for organs from people involved in car crashes
1073,there are more incidents of self driving technology preventing accidents then causing them this post is moronic and made with a political agenda
1074,so its almost a good thing vehicular accidents happen in regards to organ donation
1075,ive been working on a report of sorts on organ donationtransplantation and was in attendance at the white houses summit on this topic a few months ago generally speaking here is the current plan of attack to solve the crisis short term get more people to register as donors and get organ procurement organizations to accept new forms of registration such as social declarations on twitter facebook etc a lot of viable organs that dont get transplanted stem from next of kin not knowing the deceased persons wishes improve current practices to make donor organs last longer in between harvest and transplant and clean up organs that are considered borderline viable these practices are starting to be seen around the country but have a ways to go d printing the future solutions to completely eradicate the problem are here in their infancy still a long ways off so we need steps and to hold us over the dod is actually pouring a decent chunk of money into this technology if you can save a soldier in war with it you can eventually save civvies back at home
1076,maybe the government will claim ownership of our bodies and redistribute our organs
1077,i just realized that if we program the cars to intentionally crash head on we can solve the organ shortage once and for all this post will serve as proof of my intellectual property so none of you can steal my nobel peace prize
1078,wouldnt it mean that there would be less people in traumatic accidents and thus less people needing organs as well it will all even out
1079,but how many recipients are also needing new organs because of car accidents
1080,ok so i get the idea behind this and after reading most of the comments yes self driving cars will cut down on the vehicular accident that give us healthy organs for the sick but i dont think thats what we should be worried about what we should be doing is fixing the things that made us sick to being with i mean a middle age man needs a liver bc of some underline health reason shouldnt have to rely on some young man to die in a car accident the smart people should be working to stop the middle aged man from getting sick
1081,ok so i get the idea behind this and after reading most of the comments yes self driving cars will cut down on the vehicular accident that give us healthy organs for the sick but i dont think thats what we should be worried about what we should be doing is fixing the things that made us sick to being with i mean a middle age man needs a liver bc of some underline health reason shouldnt have to rely on some young man to die in a car accident the smart people should be working to stop the middle aged man from getting sick
1082,am i reading that wrong or what i feel like the article is saying that when people die in a car crash their organs or harvested and save others that the in organs come from people who died in car crashes not that the in people who need transplants are the people in car crashes other peoples comments have me confused
1083,am i reading that wrong or what i feel like the article is saying that when people die in a car crash their organs or harvested and save others that the in organs come from people who died in car crashes not that the in people who need transplants are the people in car crashes other peoples comments have me confused

1085,selfie accidents should continue to rise so hopefully that will balance it out
1086,oh good people will die less organ donors no less so we know theyre good folks
1087,what percentage organs are needed by people who have gotten injured in car accidents
1088,correct me if im wrong but arent a lot of people in need of organs as a result of vehicle accidents as well or is it just mainly agehealth
1089,i wonder how this compares to the numbers of required organs that come from damage sustained in vehicle accidents i also remember reading on this sub that theyre working on growing artificial organs and even d printing them tech solves all problems just not always at the same rate
1090,i wonder how many of the people in need of donor organs are in that situation from vehicular accidents
1091,got news for youself driving cars will be killing plenty of people particularly walking pedestrians
1092,kinda of a grim thing we need people to die in order to save others
1093,what if the system encounters a glitch and people die anyways
1094,how many people need a transplant due to the result of a vehicular accident
1095,so whats the proposed solution crash peoples self driving cars on purpose to get their organs
1096,this whole article talks about how number in deaths waiting on organ transplants will rise but never compares these numbers to the number of people who die in car accidents every year like someone else said itt its a good problem to have when car accident deaths are over five times that of the waiting for transplant deaths given in this article
1097,this whole article talks about how number in deaths waiting on organ transplants will rise but never compares these numbers to the number of people who die in car accidents every year like someone else said itt its a good problem to have when car accident deaths are over five times that of the waiting for transplant deaths given in this article
1098,wouldnt it also serve to decrease demand for organs if fewer people are having car accidents
1099,just felt like pointing this out liver and kidney disease kill more people than breast cancer or prostate cancer except one is usually due to lifestyle habits the other is because god hates you maybe anti alcoholism campaigns will bring down that list of people waiting for organs
1100,i wonder how many of the organs needed come from people who were in a car accident wouldnt the number of organ donations needed also go down if a large quantity comes from car accidentials
1101,yeah this isnt the terrifying part what we need to start doing is training the massive workforce that are truck drivers to learn a new skill do you think they will want to pay a person to do the job a machine can do more efficiently cheaper safer oh and they dont have that problem of sleeping this will be a pain point on the economy because once the change happens it will be so rapid they wont know what hit them
1102,its not the concept of this argument that pisses me off its the wording its incredibly moot i give a fuck about people receiving organs as much as i give a fuck about people not dying in car accidents are they asking me to pick a side here what the fuck
1103,i wonder how many people in need of organs are in that situation due to car crashes
1104,i wonder how many people in need of organs are in that situation due to car crashes
1105,cant we have the cars like crash once in a while to get our organs fresh lets say we need a heart a kidney and a liver and this car is owned by a healthy something person i say lets do it s
1106,if you are waiting for a kidney please consider the rice diet program at duke university
1107,ill choose to donate my organs when this country finally recognizes the right to die instead of treating people who try to commit suicide because they suffer from something like a terminal illness like somebody on death row
1108,i mean they have a point bit who looks on the down side of less deaths from car crashes
1109,i mean they have a point bit who looks on the down side of less deaths from car crashes
1110,its not everyone elses duty to die so that a few people may live longer this is a seriously distasteful statement to make
1111,sounds to me like a job for serial killers but really though we should be growing organs soon enough yeah
1112,thats a really stupid title thats not a problem thats called increasing quality of life instead of making it seem like people should be dying in horrific car crashes to harvest their organs lets push for organ fabrication technology sheesh
1113,thats a really stupid title thats not a problem thats called increasing quality of life instead of making it seem like people should be dying in horrific car crashes to harvest their organs lets push for organ fabrication technology sheesh
1114,my first thought was that thats a shame because while certainly plenty of good people die in crashes vehicular accidents have always been an effective evolutionary means of culling worthless shithead alphas from the populationand if by chance they are donors then they will at least do one beneficial thing before going into the grave but then i realized that self driving cars will alter shithead behavior much less than that of good people because what pretty boy showoff is going to just sit there and let some bitch ass tesla tell him how fast to drive

1118,well we better start getting better at d printing organs then although dont forget that who ever programs the smart cars is most likely going to program it to hit the least amount of people in an accident so there still might be a good amount of people organs left
1119,just make the cars randomly cause accidents and problem solved
1120,so more people need to die so we can save more lives
1121,we need people to die so we can save people who are about to die
1122,what about the people who crash there car and then need organs because of the crash
1123,i think someone failed basic math addition problems id rather save lives than kill and save
1124,i have a similar concern but whats going to happen to all the junkscrap yards if all the accidents go away where am i going to get cheap replacement parts im not buying that shit direct from the manufacturer because theyll only sell me the part i need if i buy it in a package with other parts i have no use for for
1125,at least the people who die from not getting an organ will be able to donate the rest of their organs
1126,with any luck self driving cars will help to cut down on the number of people who may need organ transplants due to traffic accidents
1127,how many of those people need an organ because they were in a car accident
1128,how many organ transplants are required each year because of car accidents sorry if its in the article havent read it yet
1129,its ok by the time self driving cars are fully utilized the organ growth technologies will likely have caught up and be in full swing still doesnt hurt to be on full tech alert for other methods though i guess on the darker side i guess the numbers lost in vehicle accidents will be made up for in unemployed trucker suicides should no kind of basic income be established in the next years
1130,yay we need to save more lives by killing more lives oo
1131,its a catch people die either way this issue is meaningless unless more people die on one side of the argument than the other
1132,im sure there will be plenty of donor organs available from all the people that kill themselves once the self driving cars steal their jobs
1133,i think it will be a trade off people stop dying in accidents and people will start dying from diseases injuries and conditions that necessitate a transplant due to lack donors
1134,welp better start working on synthetic this isnt a bad thing that theres less car accidents
1135,im assuming many people needing organs could be from being in accidents
1136,we dont even have a large number of them on the roads and are already concluding that it will reduce accidents thats not science its wishful thinking lets see how humans and self driving cars pilot on the roads together before we jump to conclusions
1137,hmm but wouldnt that be balanced against the number of people needing donor organs due to trauma from a car accident at the very least a lot of blood is used every year treating all the car crash accidents
1138,hmm but wouldnt that be balanced against the number of people needing donor organs due to trauma from a car accident at the very least a lot of blood is used every year treating all the car crash accidents
1139,you are experiencing an accident
1140,while i agree i think its important to note that people are still potentially going to die the difference will be that the deaths will no longer be those bad luck road incidents that happen in a flash with no real lead up but rather sick patients in hospitals that have been suffering from some sort of geneticorgan problem in this small case were no longer saving lives were preventing accidental deaths

1142,yea like what are we gonna do start killing more people the only thing we can really hope for is an advancement in fake organs and use of non human organs
1143,dont worry bikers will still die in droves they are not going to be replaced by self driving cars until you outlaw them
1144,the european journal of medical research reviewed such transplants to see if they were wasted organs from to they did liver transplants of these were from blunt trauma arising from auto accidents if this holds true for other organs i would say its an extremely low percentage im not great at math but percent
1145,you could adjust the probability to match demand you could even with advanced enough cars make sure that the correct organs are still viable after the crash happy driving
1146,you are experiencing a car accident
1147,id say fuck all and not even bother doing it people having to die to save others is just retarded
1148,isnt it a little silly to say that these two processes need to or should be be related d printed organs would greatly improve medicine with or without organ donations from car crashes assuming automated cars cause less deaths that is a great improvement regardless of increased deaths from those waiting for organs how many people die in car crashes per person saved from organs obtained from a car crash how many people could be saved today with d printed organs i did some math transplants were performed in i read in or transplants come from car accidents so people were saved in from car accident organ donations however people died in car accidents so for car accidents to donor transplant every one life saved about people die this doesnt count how many of those were failed transplants i think it is fair to say lets lower automotive deaths asap about people die each year waiting for a transplant even with car crashes i think it is safe to say lets lower that via advanced technologies asap

1152,even if old cars dont vanish in one moment increasing quantity of self driving cars will reduce number of accidents drastically imagine if only one quarter of all cars are self driving ones how many accidents involve only one vehicle i think a lot so minus deaths there how many accidents wont happen because of the fact that one quarter of cars is driving perfectly and so on even if small changes happen people will see that auto cars kill less people and governments will follow peoples desires and put strong regulations on regulary cars

1154,per this comment only a small proportion less than of transplants are needed because of an auto accident thats extrapolating from one organ but id expect some organs like heart and lung to be even less though im surprised that its even that high
1155,doing what allowing them to crash
1156,until some of the remaining republicans complain were as bad as them for killing off our political opponents and should start killing ourselves off as well
1157,self driving cars are rarely going to crash most crashes are caused by human error nobody knows what the future will hold when it comes to self driving cars the market will dictate if companys still produce manual drive cars i think its unlikely that itll be mandatory to have a self driving car

1159,the math was done earlier in this thread of organ transplants are needed because of care accidents
1160,not many people need organ transplants from car crashes
1161,not many people need organ transplants from car crashes
1162,in fact i can imagine hackers doing it and making it look like an accident
1163,why does this sound like a summer action blockbuster waiting to happen that starts when the rugged white male heros wife and daughter are in one of those randomly crashed cars and ends with the dystopia being overthrown and him finding a new love interest
1164,please remain calm and accept that you are dead it is more efficient if we dont crash the car or actually harm you before harvesting your organs
1165,kills you anyway
1166,how many of those in need of one are put in that position by a car crash
1167,its still a net positive though more people will survive than die if fatal accidents are significantly reduced even if there is a decrease in donated organs it may be a cold way to look at it but it really is a good problem to have
1168,its still a net positive though more people will survive than die if fatal accidents are significantly reduced even if there is a decrease in donated organs it may be a cold way to look at it but it really is a good problem to have
1169,there was an article before on this sub about scientists breeding pigs with human genomes and growing human organs in them we kill pigs for bacon getting a new lung or heart from them would be a bonus
1170,they have to die in a certain manner as well i gave a lecture to a bunch of lawyers on fed and state laws concerning organ donation powers of attorney and living wills are a big part of my practice and learned a lot more in preparing my talk but i learned even more when we lost our sister in a crash last year heart and lungs for example require brain death versus cardiac death so the organs are still viable others can have cardiac death but in our case there was very little but some brain activity which precluded the donation of heart and lungs she eventually was removed form life support and many donations were made it was quite an experience going from lecturing and advising about and then being on the other side having to deal with it also note the organ donor people have to swoop in asap to get the ball rolling and the doctors and nurses are in the process of keeping one alive or dying with dignity and the family is in shock and grieving as we were it creates an interesting dynamic between the three in dealing with a tragic loss

1172,first consider in this small case were no longer saving lives were preventing accidental deaths im not sure that accounting holds true in fact i think that sort of accounting saving lives versus preventing deaths is exactly the kind of psychological impediment that humans have which leads to illogical behavior by distancing the consequences of an action from the act itself and in this case the implication whether or not you share or intend it is that the direct intervention of saving someones life is somehow different than the indirect action of saving someones live in fact the very nature of the terminology you use an accidental death ie a death without human fault due to lack of intent or human action or in a more general sense a life already forfeit to statistics implies a distance morally speaking from the action we dont have a moral obligation to protect against accidental deaths due to say meteor strikes because there is no one to fault for the meteors action once the means is available to alter the statistic of accidents such as reducing accidental cancer deaths by reducing radioactive emissions by reducing coal consumption or reducing accidental starvation by planting of dwarf wheat the decision to implement or not to implement that policy or technology becomes a moral decision with very real blood in the balance even though not taking any action was an amoral position to have before such means were available it is no longer a balance between action and accident the way we treat fault and intent leads to irrational behavior like overconsumption exploitation ignoring genocides improper alignment of prison goals and outcomes etc next while i agree i think its important to note that people are still potentially going to die one might consider both the quality and longevity of life of a person who doesnt die due to stopping very quickly and maybe being asked to occupy too small a volume versus someone who doesnt die because a failing organ has been replaced in that case one might consider a single life saved from a driving accident to be better than one life saved via an organ transplant in fact i would bet that some more in depth accounting regarding average expectations for personal achievement personal utility social enrichment utility derived through human interaction economic achievement both from creation and consumption and familial achievement having a spouse and children combined with the probably longer lifespan of a healthy person who doesnt die would mean that an objective observer would probably find it reasonable to prioritize several prevented deaths over one person saved via an organ transplant we can also consider the fraction of accident victims whose organs are compatible with a donor available within range of a suitable donor and which survive the transport and implantation procedure i dont think theres any basis for any equivalence between the death of a car accident victim and the death of a person who doesnt receive an organ transplant edit in this analysis i was basing my assumptions on major organ donations and probably some stereotypical bias of organ recipients thats probably not true although i was considering the consequences of a healthy individual versus someone living on immunosuppressants for the rest of their life and the potential for better immunosuppressants or some alternative therapy becoming available later in the organ recipients life im open to any debate on these presumptions but my overall point is that the weighting of societal benefit to the organ recipient versus the crash victim is more than a or depending on how many lives get saved from one persons organs direct equivalence im entirely open to the possibility that such accounting would tell us that killing people in car crashes and harvesting their organs is better for society than taking action to reduce car crashes at that point we end up with arguments of personal liberty etc i believe my original point that choosing whether or not to take action eg preventing people who need organ transplants from dying by banning the use of self driving cars is still a moral decision i think not taking an action becomes a moral decision once an action is available that alters the outcome of whatever is in question so categorizing something as preventing accidents versus saving lives becomes a false difference

1177,im an organ donor but i prefer an opt in i believe the default should be that your organs belong to your body and not the government when you die you shouldnt just become a potential harvest that should be an intimate decision that you choose yourself not the government by default besides its already hard to do anything with the government bureaucracy people dont want to have to wait half a day at the dmv just to remove organ donor status that they never chose themselves
1178,now there is a great conspiracy nearby vip needs an organ just orchestrate a crash and voila organs on demand
1179,that would be an interesting take on a dystopian future for a bookmovie all accidents and human error related deaths and injuries are solved by ai and robotics but there is still a need for death to counter balance population growth supply organs and such for transplants and all of the other things that are positives about death for everyone but the person dying and their loved ones let people join a lottery system where the greater the likelihood they win the lottery and are selected for an accident the better the benefits while still alive full free access to an autonomous vehicle chance you die each time to ride unlimited access to food and nourishment for free that will be a chance to die every time you eat something and on and on those who consume the least have the lowest chance of death while those most gluttonous with our collective resources are more likely to get culled from the herd could be interesting

1188,im an organ recipient one is better than the other far more people die yearly to car accidents than lack of organ transplants yes more very sick people will die if i live long enough it could directly impact me if i needed another bilateral lung transplant however im not more in need of those organs than the person they belong to if i have to choose x many people die or y many people die im going to choose the one where fewer people die obviously yes organ transplant is a truly wonderful thing and im alive today because if it am i glad my donor died absolutely not i am glad that she chose to give life however despite tragedy that said she wasnt the victim of accident or suicide but als

1190,thats a good point i guess killing and harvesting the organs of republicans was a bad idea after all
1191,doesnt matter if the cars can sense the motorcycles if the motorcycle is crashing into the car
1192,most of their crash data showed it was older people who traditionally bought american who had bought a prius after the cash for clunkers program it wasnt a car thing it was stupid fucking drivers just like audi in the s i mean what exactly changed in the floor mat design that crash proofed the car nothing nothing changed but you cant go on national tv and say most old biddies are fucking retarded

1194,and making it more likely the anesthesia will kill you and render your organs mostly worthless
1195,you have been hacked rerouting to secluded spot in the woods important upon your arrival remove your clothes to avoideh im going to kill you anyway
1196,there are more than people currently on transplant waiting lists my intuition great source is that not many of these patients need organs because of trauma from an accident since motor vehicle accidents are such an obvious source of organs i found it difficult near impossible to find out how many accident or trauma victims are put on the organ transplant receiving list the liver is one of the most commonly injured organs in trauma and also one of the common organs to transplant i found the following information in this study which indicates of liver transplants went to victims of motor vehicle accidents all liver transplantations at our institution were reviewed retrospectively this covered liver transplants between september and december of them transplants were performed due to motor vehicle accidents which caused uncontrollable acute liver trauma in patients however there appears to be a bias against organ transplant in trauma patients for fear of bad outcomes and wasting organs so trauma victims probably dont get all the organ transplants they need
1197,going to go out on a limb and say not many the kinds of injuries sustained during a car accident are generally contusions to limbs burns head and spinal injuries or completenear complete pulverization which doesnt leave much to be harvested
1198,couldnt be many at all if fatal car crashes still leave organs intact enough to be harvested than its unlikely that non fatal car crashes would make organs unusable in many scenarios
1199,couldnt be many at all if fatal car crashes still leave organs intact enough to be harvested than its unlikely that non fatal car crashes would make organs unusable in many scenarios
1200,isnt it that if organ donor dieswithout destroying all the organs in the accident they go on to save a whole bunch of lives or improve quality of life for dozens of others its not a trade off in organ donation edit google says organ donor can save up to live or saveimprove life of up to people through tissue and eye donations

1202,even if its a net loss avoiding fatal accidents is better than people dying so the sick can live the sick would die anyway
1203,even if its a net loss avoiding fatal accidents is better than people dying so the sick can live the sick would die anyway
1204,when i first got my license they asked me are you an organ donor i said no definitely not only recently i found out that they were asking me if id like to donate my organs if i died not if i had ever donated an organ before
1205,another brilliant thought exercise a drunk asshole driving mph hits a curb flips upside down and collides with a mini van killing a family of small child gets to adopt a new year old rescue dog because the family of cant take care of that animal anymore because theyre all dead like i said just a thought exercise
1206,on the flip side someone who has liver disease from a lifetime of alcoholism wont get an organ transplant from a lifetime safe driver who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and was killed by a reckless driver
1207,my mother was an organ donor if its viable they will harvestclear down to long bones to make bone screws made frombone there is soooo much to be usedunless the victim crashed their bike and exploded they can findsomehing
1208,thats why in wales we have a soft opt out you can opt in like anywhere else if you definitely want to be a donor when you die and you can still opt out if you definitely dont however if you havent opted in or out youre automatically considered to be ok with donating unless your family say otherwise so if you come from a religious background where your cant donate your organs do any religions teach that but you just never got round to opting out your family can still let the doctors know that on the other hand it means for the vast majority of people who have no issue with the idea theyre now automatically opted in instead of out like before
1209,a part of an opt out system would have to include public awareness in the us i am sure people would think doctors might not try as hard to save you if there are people who need organs when the affordable care act was passed people thought death panels would decide when people would die i still think its quite fundamentally morally wrong to not have each and every individual knowingly choose what happens after they go rather than creating an incentive for the state to keep people ignorant of it the choice would still be there both opt out and opt in provide people the opportunity to choose the only difference is the default setting i think that most people dont care what happens to their organs after they die i think that laziness keeps more form opting in that single extra step of signing up to be an organ donor might means viable organs not going to people that need them those that dont want to donate can still opt out with the same procedure we use now to opt in but they will to go to the bottom of organ donation lists if they ever need one
1210,id imagine its relatively easy to transplant corneas well after the fact but im not sure how likely it is a car accident would destroy the corneas but leave the rest of the eye intact maybe with broken glass from the windshield or windows flying around or if someone was wearing eyeglasses and they shattered in their eye but that would seem to damage more than the cornea
1211,what are you talking about it was obviously a falcon punch that killed my liver sip
1212,but the pistol actually kills them so
1213,plus you dont jump the queue just because you got into a car accident
1214,student nurse here currently working on a transplant floor at a hospital in florida i can tell you that of our patients who are receiving these transplants need them due to chronic illnesses honestly ive never seen a single one of our patients need the organ because of some injury like a car crash they need them because of single or multi organ failure
1215,my intuition great source since when did rfuturology become averse to speculation your intuition is the same as mine any traumatic injury severe enough to make you need a new organ is likely to kill you before you get on the organ donation list plus it would need to be an organ that medicine had a way to compensate for if you didnt have it like a kidney but in that case youd need to lose both and that would be a severe trauma that youd likely not survive as the aorta is nestled right in between them
1216,i agree however motorcycle accidents are usually the number source of donations http wheelsblogsnytimescommotorcycle helmets and donor organs _r
1217,if im in a non fatal car crash and you try to take my organs were going to have problems
1218,ok fine but that doesnt mean its good for them to die otherwise we could just pick random people off the street and shoot them in the head then harvest their organs i dont think anyone other than the strictest utilitarian would be ok with that even though youre saving multiple lives at the expense of one so unless youd advocate for that you cant really argue self driving cars saving lives is a bad thing due to the organ issue
1219,if thats your argument for why its bad that fewer healthy people die in car accidents to become organ donors why stop there lets start a lottery to select healthy citizens to harvest each selected donor could save up to people after all
1220,if thats your argument for why its bad that fewer healthy people die in car accidents to become organ donors why stop there lets start a lottery to select healthy citizens to harvest each selected donor could save up to people after all
1221,this is oddly comforting when i die my useless body shouldnt go in a box in the ground where i cant even really be used as fertilizer let it help people who need it
1222,it would be great after people catch on they would know they are going to die because the car is driving towards the area around hospital and not their wanted destination theyd have to jump out or something
1223,actually part of the scoring is based on how soon you are to death someone who only had a week to live is placed higher up than someone who has months to live so if said car accident cause acute organ failure that person would indeed move up the list
1224,i think cageboy meant the person who caused the accident becoming the donor to save the person he just almost killed instant karma
1225,i think cageboy meant the person who caused the accident becoming the donor to save the person he just almost killed instant karma
1226,fun story when i got a motorcycle my mother told me to put organ donor down when getting my license that way if i died doing something stupid i could be useful to someone thanks mom
1227,organs are exclusively taken from people that are still alive but wont be able to heal or are brain dead a dead persons organs would be useless unless their organs were removed within minutes donor organs are taken from people that are usually close to death or that died in a medical setting with doctors already ready to remove vital organs edit for clarification sometimes organs can be harvested after someones dead but it has to be done very quickly in ideal conditions and even then its a shot in the dark the vast majority come from living people though
1228,sure but many transplant recipients end up needing other transplants down the line you getting multiple liver transplants is still only one life extended not multiple lives saved last i checked the hippocratic oath also has a part about never do harm which means any surgeon or other doctor should be for self driving cars regardless of organ donation outcome as an aside car crash fatalities are people who will still die just in another way sometimes soon sometimes much later if donors they are still as likely to be viable donors on death this covers more than just your post but fuck it

1230,well theyd still have to die before the organs would become harvestable allowing private sale of organs would indeed be a terrible idea
1231,this would make a big difference this is discussed in daniel kahnemans book thinking fast and slow here is a small review http review thinking fast and slow high donation countries like austria follow an opt out format if you dont want to be an organ donor you have to tick a box the low donation countries feature an opt in model whereby you have to check a box to have your liver harvested by medical science when you die
1232,given all the different ways it is possible to die you could be missing organs regardless also if i am to be resurrected ill be asking the almighty for a new body
1233,sure but because of your choices not because its impossible a couple of years ago i was staying with some friends at a camp site the road that we turned off of to get to it is a very dangerous road statistically speaking where many deaths occur while we were sitting around the campfire drinking there was the very distinct sound of two motorcycles zzzzzzzzzzzoooooom zzzzzzzzzzzoooooom crash two of my friends and i hoofed it down to the site of the crash to find that two motorcycles had come up over a small rise at over mph on a mph limit road and hit a car that was turning into the camp site we were staying both of the riders were obliterated basically meat but the driver and passenger of the cage were also in pretty bad shape the passenger was beat all to fuck blood all over him but conscious and the driver was insensate with injuries he could groan in what seemed to be response to shouted questions and had to be air lifted to the hospital close by yes you have to be being really fucking stupid in order to hurt a lot of other people on a motorcycle but it can be done edit article about the crash http supply more information in fatal glenn highway crasharticle_eaceebc e e afc cefhtml
1234,i think competition and the fact that manual dive crashes will likely decrease will keep prices about the same or even bring them down
1235,i think competition and the fact that manual dive crashes will likely decrease will keep prices about the same or even bring them down
1236,i wouldnt blame you i would do the same in fact imo if you are going to die without the surgery i find it a little negligent if arent trying to get put first on that list im sure there are some people who are more noble then me who would go to the bottom of the list on purpose to let others in front of them
1237,doesnt matter liver transplant eligibility is based upon the patients meld model for end stage liver disease score and hla typing meld scores are reported to unos the organ donation coordinating organization and unos allocates the organs meld is an objective score combining a patients serum creatinine bilirubin coagulation studies and serum sodium it also factors in the presence of hepatocellular carcinoma if indicated befriending the surgeon wouldnt help his cause and it may actually harm it because vip status has been shown to cause worse outcomes source i do transplant anesthesia
1238,so when an automatic car crashes who pays the insurance bill
1239,so when an automatic car crashes who pays the insurance bill
1240,if i get killed by a self driving car im going to be so pissed
1241,im most interested in how long it will take to bring autonomous cars up to the standards of say a german driver were shooting pretty low in this country if we just want the cars to kill a few less people than somebody who was haphazardly trained by a parent who only remembers half the rules thinks signaling is optional and doesnt know what to do when they see a stopped school bus and still has a license
1242,self driving cars will never become prevelant until there are policies in place to address liability issues if a person gets hit by a car today the driver is held responsible what happens if someone is killed by a self driving car im not a lawyer but i imagine that the manufacturer would be held responsible in some way i cant imagine any company would be willing to take on that much risk
1243,but currently if a driver kills someone i love i can hunt them down destroy everything they know and love before they beg me for death how am i going to do this with a self driving car
1244,while at a system level the decision will be made by government types at the ground it will be the individual are they comfortable giving up control of the vehicle despite the average person believing they have above average driving skills if its uber auto pilot will they just accept it and trust because thats the only reasonable option available or because of cost this is only a transitory phase anyway progress will continue to be made and in a year or so autonomous cars will be that much better than humans at driving give it years and us meat bags wont have any more excuses
1245,i think the biggest problem with autonomous cars are going to be hackers you really think auto mobile industry is going to provide top notch security i doubt it heck even multi billion dollar corporations like google cant keep them out another issue is accountability is it the driver or the car at fault when an accident occurs how would insurance work
1246,i used to agree with the idea in the title now after seeing the accidents coming from tesla and uber im not so sure that were using a good enough safety framework even if we allow the code to be closed source we should allow the general public a way to find and submit bugs currently theres a pilot in these cars and heshes supposed to take over in case something goes wrong yet in the uber case the driver wasnt paying attention id make it mandatory to have a system in the car that alerts the driver if hes distracted farm distracted driver detection and exceeding a quota should be treated as reckless driving another thing im suggesting is a database of all accidents where a self driving car was involved and if the police can provide a way to recreate the conditions of an accident all makers of self driving cars need to pass all previously known tests before releasing major updates
1247,i must disagree with the articles pronouncement of what we need to accept the burden is on the technology developers to clearly demonstrate that their design is better than the status quo enough better to justify the added cost in the earlier days of self driving cars there was a wholly unwarranted presumption on the part of many that self driving cars were going to be absolutely safe and the general public is slowly becoming educated on the limitations of the technology if you really understand how deep learning systems operate youll know that theyre a total black box that cannot be verified to operate properly by any manner of proof its been demonstrated that changing of even a single pixel can change object classification decisions its been demonstrated that pasting small images of other signs in the blank space of signs can cause them to be misrecognized because the black block deep learning recognizers are designed to read signs at a variety of scales in the recent uber case a software failure caused the perception of a pedestrian obstacle in the middle of the road to be effectively ignored all this technology is also going to cost money itll make cars more expensive but the ability to drive away from the destination enables cars to be shared which can greatly affect the actual cost of ownership the number of cars on the road and the occupancy and eventually the need for parking spaces nevertheless if the added cost of the technology isnt balanced by a decrease in the cost of killing and maiming drivers passengers occupants of other vehicles pedestrians and bystanders we should be highly resistant to accepting these products thats not to say its the way its going to happen people were so in love with their cell phones that they failed to resist the temptation to use them while they were driving exacting an extremely high cost in lives lost and injuries that persist to the present day users are paying the price of this in their automobile insurance cost but these costs are not redeemed by the companies responsible for the manufacture marketing or sales of cell phones so far cell phone makers havent been obliged to pay for a failure to make their products safe regulation has encouraged makers to add facilities for hands free use which has not yet been proven to make them safe to use while driving indeed studies to date suggest that users still become too cognitively occupied to safely operate a vehicle and a phone together current half driving cars on the market present another danger particularly given users penchants for operating them beyond the stated capabilities defeating safety systems such as by pressing an orange into the steering wheel and so forth theres been clear evidence that reducing the drivers workload with these systems makes the driver less attentive to the task rendering them unable to assist the half driver when it malfunctions or needs to pass control back to the driver unlike airplanes where there may be many seconds before an autopilot controlled plane becomes unsafe or uncontrollable the geometry of the driving task demands sub second responses to unusual conditions

1249,i would rather die to a self driving car than to a stupid human who drives drunk or simply reckless
1250,look im a believer in the tech eventually but the whole even our most underdeveloped models will be an improvement is speculative bullshit ive been driving since without a ticket or accident much of that through mn winters disclosure i did slip into someones bumper in a parking lot during an ice storm but was going very slow and no damage was done i have over years in my model and that clobbers the years in automated driving for sure computers will end up being better and wont be distracted or get tired still we have a long way to go to prove that the tech is consistently better than humans one needs to consider we also have a long history of hubris and over confidence in technology visa crashes all across europe this weekend leaving millions without a way to pay we found out last year that pretty much every single chip is vulnerable to attack im not against it and i get that we need to prepare people for failures but lets not over promise

1253,i dont want a self driving car if im going to die in a car accident at least i want to be responsible for my own death rather than some random computer glitch lol
1254,i dont want a self driving car if im going to die in a car accident at least i want to be responsible for my own death rather than some random computer glitch lol
1255,agree completely while we should do everything in our power to minimize and mitigate any dangers and death there invariably are going to be accidents just like the first horse drawn buggies just like the introduction of trains streetcars planes and yes automobiles any new world altering technologies in transportation will come at a cost in life
1256,as someone who has never killed anyone while driving fuck off with that
1257,that is unacceptable just an excuse with this logic might as well start selling unproven medicine in the market it will surely kill some people but over the long haul cures will be discovered
1258,a lot of people died in the creation of the offspry helicopter prob spelled wrong these people were willing to die for this if im driving down the high way and the self driving car kills me its different because i didnt sign up for this shit
1259,a lot of people died in the creation of the offspry helicopter prob spelled wrong these people were willing to die for this if im driving down the high way and the self driving car kills me its different because i didnt sign up for this shit
1260,imagine after the first car accident causing death people would have said we should have stayed with the horses
1261,smart cars will kill hundreds but will save thousands
1262,the humans that get killed by self driving cars are most likely to blame the technology is good but human error will always be a factor in road deaths weather driving or not
1263,id rather get killed by a self driving car because i know my death will cause an investigation on what went wrong and will lead to an improvement if i get killed by someone texting theres no guarantee their driving will improve or they will stop texting and driving
1264,people are going to die at first get over it is probably not the greatest stance to take if youre trying to promote widespread adoption in order to flatten the learning curve for the driving algorithms when theres a perfectly viable alternative available that people have been using for years most people will be happy to say no thanks let me know when youve worked all the kinks out and then ill think about it even if they are statistically more safe in an autonomous vehicle the technology needs strong adoption because truly safe autonomous driving is going to require millions upon millions of miles driven so that nearly every combination of scenarios can be encountered and appropriately mitigated through software learning then theres the whole casualty insurance elephant in the room that no one seems to want to address
1265,itt people being perfectly okay with robots killing humans
1266,problem if a human driver kills someone theyre liable personally through their insurance if an autonomous car kills someone the car maker will probably assume liability that shifts the incentives with the risks and corporations are far more risk averse than people
1267,theyll kill less people than my blind grandma will in the coming years shes good to drive for more years just because she passed the eye exam a year ago
1268,in other words these cars will kill some of you but lets just get over that because i think its totally going to be worth it for me if you lose your life the future is going to be cool
1269,half a million a year die on the road and nobodys bats an eye kill guy with a robot car and everyone loses there mind
1270,half a million a year die on the road and nobodys bats an eye kill guy with a robot car and everyone loses there mind
1271,the title article is really bad it makes it out to be that self driving cars will try to kill people
1272,i live in a place where hunting is pretty much not allowed and there arent very many predators left so the deer have overpopulated every single patch of undeveloped land around and they literally run right out in front of you especially in autumn i once had one run into the side of my car while i was at a stop sign and break my side mirror im not trying to get killed by a deer coming through my windshield how do self driving cars account for that
1273,so how is this going to work legally if youre texting or drunk behind the wheel and cause an accident you personally can get hauled into court if you hit a patch of ice through no fault of your own and slide into somebody your insurance in some places bites the bullet who pays the piper if your self driving car takes it into its little circuits to cross the median at mph and wipe out a family of in a minivan in the oncoming lane
1274,didnt all this start over that car and someone breaking there ankle or did someone die
1275,some of you may die but that is a sacrifice i am willing to make lord farquaad
1276,it is not rational for an excellent driver to cede control to an inferior machine it is reasonable enough i suppose for a bad driver to cede to a superior machine then again it is even more reasonable for a bad driver to pay attention and adopt safer driving practices so im not seeing us reasoning our way into self driving vehicles that kill us tl dr statistical improvements in survival rates do not necessarily translate to what make sense for individuals
1277,i agree but think a lot of laws need to be worked out soon who is responsible for any accident thats the ultimate question who pays for damages and do we convict the makers or the person who is behind the wheel what happens if it is a complete accident on all parts i remember reading some cars will put the safety of the occupants of the vehicle above all else as a luxury design to be sold almost like a safety feature that takes it as collateral damage cars like that should be highly illegal imo imagine if an automated car chooses to hit a person on the sidewalk because there is no other way to avoid a collision and save the occupants that in my mind is unacceptable morally right now human drivers are at the mercy of the human condition with the eventually increase of automation we can literally pre program ahead of time what we want to happen this is just one tiny facet of so many questions that will need to be answered
1278,how much were you paid to post this crap bad food will kill people but it is an improvement on the really really bad food
1279,in the same time period as those two accidents involving teslas i wonder how many accidents involving human driven cars occurred and how many of those were fatal id wager quite a lot
1280,well as long as self drivingassisting cars kill less people and make daily commute faster bring on the future but i still hope for teleportation
1281,stop these articles stop saying death equivalency is good enough thats not the issue at all this issue is that driving in a automated car was like being taken on a ride by a depressed chauffeur huffing glue sure most of the time he does great but every once and a while he does something completely irrational before passing out leading to easy fatalities we have to be able to relax ourselves these articles advocates blind trust it doesnt matter if my chauffeur thinks its okay to drive full speed into the side of a semi truck sometimes because hes still better than the average driver does the psychological mindset of the passengers matter at all this is not respect or trust its blind submission to a ridiculously flawed driver what if this chauffeur was x more likely to cause life crippling permanent injuries in every crash than the average driver what if every fatality it caused was a small child that he runs over at mph because those damn kids are too small to see yet he still only killed as many humans as the average driver nhtsa is right to advocate for x less fatalities before its ready i think were getting pretty close to trustworthy self driving cars and most people dont realize how damn easy it will be to achieve once we have the right software

1283,is anyone actually advocating for self driving technology to be halted as a result of these accidents or is this article perhaps a self defense response to the media criticism teslaautomated vehicles have received in recent weeks there is nothing wrong with the media reporting on the failures of this new technology thats how improvements are made i have no idea why people jump straight to whataboutisms when anything even slightly critical of self driving cars is published well what about human drivers well what about them what does that have anything to do with self driving technology and the limitations that the industry currently has
1284,reddit pushes this ai shit so much im starting to wonder if its being run by ai you guys are literally trying to normalize robot cars killing people in mass before it starts happening wtf
1285,the biggest concern i have with this is whose life is prioritized in case of an imminent accident lets say a child runs out into the road after a ball or something self driving car rolls up and does not have enough time to stop and the only options are a hit the kid or b avoid the kid at the cost of hitting a tree either scenario it is likely someone will be seriously injured or killed how can a machine be programmed to make split second decisions to minimize fatalities and injuries the kid was really doing nothing wrong but should the passengers be killed for something out of their control

1287,the problem nobody talks about is when the system gets hacked and it will and hundreds of people die
1288,apparently posts here need to be lengthy or be deleted so here goes self driving cars will kill people and we need to accept that that doesnt sound very reassuring it sounds like london lord mayor sadiq khans reassurances to the uk population in the face of all the acid attacks police sanctioned child raping gangs bombings and stabbings that he feels we must get used to the muslim threat because the threat of terror attacks are part and parcel of living in a big city will most likely be an improvement over a human drivers ability most likely that doesnt sound very reassuring anyway which human driver are they talking about
1289,yea but an automatic car driving into the back of a semi killing someone is a lot different than a drunk person crashing into a tree
1290,yea but an automatic car driving into the back of a semi killing someone is a lot different than a drunk person crashing into a tree
1291,i never understand this mentality self driving cars will never be accepted if you are asking people to accept that self driving cars can kill people its like asking people to get on a roller coaster ride but people may die on it randomly but people should accept that risk for roller coaster ride sure you might argue that human drivers have higher statistics of road accidents than self driving cars but youre ignoring that people think that in human driving those who drive properly and follow rules have significantly low risk of being in an accidents and its true too to some extent so theres an element of control here so human psychology has a tendency to think that if i drive properly ill be rewarded by safety pay attention follow the rules and my driving will keep me protected but thats not the case with self driving cars even if youre a good driver it does not have any outcome on how car drives thats like taking away control from the hands of humans its like playing russian roulette where its totally upto luck and not your driving whether youll be killed on this particular car ride or not so everytime you get in self driving car it may be your last ride and you can do nothing about it i think this will be a significant barrier in mass adoption of self driving cars unless they make their system perfect

1294,wonder how people will feel if the ai in their car makes the decision to sacrifice its passengers rather than pedestrians public eg if car loses its brakes has the choice between running off a cliff killing the passengers inside vs running into a crowd of people certainly killing many more would anyone be ok with getting into a car that may decide to kill its passengers given the right circumstances
1295,nah you shouldnt have to just accept loss of life if self driving cars will kill people they shouldnt be on the road youre an idiot at least with human drivers theres accountability no one is held accountable for self driving cars killing people yet we have the means to make them safe wannabe tech bros like you think lives dont matter to progress lol clown
1296,this idea that we should accept self driving cars killing people is questionable at least to me now self driving tech comes from private companies who owns the code eh so nobody knows whats in the code eh so therefore consider this scenario a government with less than free and democractic ideals cough china cough implements a self driving software that does not recognise certain people dissenters as humans but their death would look like a traffic accident right in fact it would be perfectly easy for a government to decide for some features ex a hijab or sunglasses or even black skin to be not human and thus eliminate undesirables in traffic accidents as long as corporations can hide behind the auto car kills less than manual car defence the life or death of every person walking down the street will be decided based on a hidden piece of code that may or may not discriminate against you oh software discrimination totally happened before i remember reading something a while back about the face unlock tech being less accurate on asians than europeans imagine this sort of thing happening with a car coming towards you

1298,so when a self driving car is bound to crash into either a mom with a baby in a troller or a grandpa walking with his grandson how does it decide who to kill and who is responsible for that decision
1299,so when a self driving car is bound to crash into either a mom with a baby in a troller or a grandpa walking with his grandson how does it decide who to kill and who is responsible for that decision
1300,i hope that the author of this shit piece is among the first killed if these toys are ever allowed to freely drive public roads
1301,bs no autonomous vehicle will ever out drive a well trained and seasoned human driver if machines make mistake than they are underdeveloped a human makes mistakes yes a human also makes corrections and builds skill based on a need to survive machine gives no fucks unless it has to do with getting amped da
1302,people get killed by people driving cars all the time
1303,good luck getting people to accept it and saying people will die is making it less popular with the public to the point they will start demanding more laws and regulations and whatever for the cars people feel as if the public are being used as the beta testers and people saying some will die get over it it will be better later isnt helping
1304,yep in the time it takes you to read a story about an isolated incident with an autonomous car dozens of people have died in accidents with human drivers
1305,yep in the time it takes you to read a story about an isolated incident with an autonomous car dozens of people have died in accidents with human drivers
1306,still at early stage of development and we can expect accidents which cause by peopletheres alot of dumb ass people on the road and more dangerous than driverless car
1307,i wonder how driver accountability will mess with things like say we have car accidents in june as it is now the fault of them falls on the individuals who caused them but now say ford motors makes autonomous cars and there are only wrecks in june but now all wrecks are fords fault and ford loses a lot of money in lawsuits i wonder how much that would discourage this technology from moving forward just thoughts i dont really know it might not have an impact at all
1308,no self driving cars shouldnt kill anyone that should be the goal and anything less should be failure
1309,is there a projected number im willing to bet its far lower than accidents caused by drivers who are drunk and drivers that text on that topic of texting and driving i feel an appropriate punishment for causing an accident whilst doing so should be a permanent loss of license
1310,i think they should drop the speaker that shouts die human as it crashes into you they dont have that well they should at first just to get a conversation going
1311,i think they should drop the speaker that shouts die human as it crashes into you they dont have that well they should at first just to get a conversation going
1312,i think they should drop the speaker that shouts die human as it crashes into you they dont have that well they should at first just to get a conversation going
1313,finally its been put into words they cant be so afraid of accidents that they just never do anything ever
1314,i honestly dont get the hype over this an average of people die in car crashes every day but somehow an autonomous car just happening to kill someone is a huge issue autonomous cars have killed people in years granted that could scale up as usag scales but ill take every years vs a day

1318,im more convinced that it will be someone gets killed in an autonomous vehicle some idiot in a regular car will ram into one head on
1319,well if the accidents happen because of human mistakesstupidity like a guy deciding to cross a high way or something its fine cant really blame them for that but if they happen because of engineering or ai problems then hell no
1320,its true that even the most advanced self driving system may make mistakes and kill people but if you watch the eevblog youtube video about the uber crash it seems that the accident was avoidable and would certainly have been avoided by a human driver and would have been avoided if certain decisions had been made differently when testing the vehicle

1323,if over all accident deaths go down end of discussion right
1324,id rather kill myself than be killed by some machine fuck also scary considering cia can hack vehicles and would be able to use this to get rid of whoever they want
1325,or we could kill three birds with one stone end the automobile walk more and end global warming win win win
1326,what if the person who dies from a self driving car isnt the same person who would have died from human error what if this has a significant impact on the life experience
1327,i think self driving cars are going to be an amazing technnological advancement and for of the situations will do good for drivers i personally am worried about a self driving cars decision making process in a trolley problem type of scenario i would hate to be deliberately killed by a self driving car in the drivers seat or as a bystander until a self driving car has the same level of self preservation built in as i do ill still be on the fence
1328,ai already quit at driving in tijuana it was terrible and people would hunk for fun drive in between lanes busses were killing machines man i was there you would quit if you were there too alt f
1329,itd be hard for it to really like mean anything anyways we already treat traffic deaths and pedestrian deaths as inevitabilities if the crowing technological utopian point her is trained statistical models might kill fewer people in the long run and we should expect them to kill indiscriminately in the short termfuck cars if you want less deaths make driving slower and more strictly regulated dont rely on fast soulless robots to fix what fast soulless humans dont care about fixing
1330,we need auto cars to deliver dead bodies to the city morgueinspectors
1331,somebody has to be responsible when a human being is killed this idea that people will just shrug it off the way they would a person being killed by a bolt of lightning completely ignores that these cars are designed by companies for profit and operated by owners for convenience
1332,years driving myself deaths kills i think ill stick with those odds keep your self driving vehicles to yourselves thanks
1333,i will not accept autonomous cars randomly killing people in wrecks why because i have control over myself not dying in a car wreck because i am a great driver i would prefer to let the terrible drivers continue to kill themselves instead of letting an autonomous car take away my ability to drive well and not die
1334,i will not accept autonomous cars randomly killing people in wrecks why because i have control over myself not dying in a car wreck because i am a great driver i would prefer to let the terrible drivers continue to kill themselves instead of letting an autonomous car take away my ability to drive well and not die
1335,we all need to go back to horse and buggy i am sure fewer people were killed by them than your standard automobile fucking progress amirite s
1336,itll absolutely kill less people than people driving cars as much as i love ripping up the roads and having fun driving myself weve gotta understand we all suck at it
1337,i feel like the headline could also be applied to modern elevators im sure it was pretty freaky to get on an elevator and push a button to go to a certain floor instead of having a trained professional do it for you and pull a fancy lever likewise automatic elevators have killed people i suppose that the fact that the machine makes decisions is the thing that really makes people queasy an elevator will either do what its supposed to do or it will malfunction and it has no choice in the matter
1338,i would say right of way issues probably cause as much vehicle damage as any other source i cant speak to deaths since right of way issues typically happen at lower speeds given that your car wont let you be a stupid selfish cunt who doesnt want to obey right of way laws that will prevent a crapton of crashes

1340,the amount of lives self driving cars will save is worth the amount of lives theyll cost as unfortunate as it is but id much rather we have autonomous vehicles if it means we cut the number of people killed annually in car crashes by a significant margin

1343,can you imagine the backlash and outrage if someone said automated personal defense firearms will kill innocent people but you just need to accept that fewer will die than if only people controlled firearms

1347,of car accidents are caused by driver error remove that error and we should see drastic reductions in traffic fatalities
1348,self driving cars accidents humans are hitting driverless cars
1349,people die on a daily basis and we have become so numb to it having someone to blame it on somehow makes it easier unfortunately self driving cars will reduce the risk greatly yet until we accept the concept of it each faulty case will face large amount of discouragement
1350,i did my thesis on autonomous vehicle safety people gonna die traffic gonna be safer the only real focus is on who takes the blamepays out the cost auto maker blames the software company software company blames the car owner car owner calls the insurance company who says only the driver is covered well there was no driver so the owner gets to defend themselves against multi billion dollar companies
1351,yes but a self driving car killing someone because key safety features were intentionally disabled is unacceptable they have to at least try their best to prevent an accident
1352,yes but a self driving car killing someone because key safety features were intentionally disabled is unacceptable they have to at least try their best to prevent an accident
1353,abso f ing lutely exactly what i always said yeah that tesla car killed a women but who said that a human driver wouldnt have some accidents are unavoidable for human or machine but i do think that eventually machines will have the better reaction to any impeding accident also when i see what idiots are driving our streets i honestly wish for more self driving cars

1355,radiolab dilemma most of us would sacrifice one person to save five its a pretty straightforward bit of moral math but if we have to actually kill that person ourselves the math gets fuzzy thats the lesson of the classic trolley problem a moral puzzle that fried our brains in an episode we did about years ago luckily the trolley problem has always been little more than a thought experiment mostly confined to conversations at a certain kind of cocktail party that is until now new technologies are forcing that moral quandry out of our philosophy departments and onto our streets so today we revisit the trolley problem and wonder how a two ton hunk of speeding metal will make moral calculations about life and death that we cant even figure out ourselves i believe it wont work until all cars are autonomous
1356,lol some of you may die but its a sacrifice _i am _ willing to make youtuberonlgiyqkw
1357,ok but id rather be killed by a person than a machine one can feel remorse and shame the other cant and i sure as hell will never own a self driving car
1358,killed by a self driving car lol what a shit way to die
1359,killed by a self driving car lol what a shit way to die
1360,i dispute this i have been driving for thirty years and not had an accident ill not give up control to ai and have it kill me

1362,uber does not get a pass on this it was predicted that based on the number of times uber safety drivers needed to take over for the car unexpectedly that they were times more likely to crash than a normal human driver this was based on their record from driving in california which required them to report those statistics something they did not have to provide while driving in other states tesla suspended their operations in california because they did not like the reporting and testing requirements tesla has also been pretty lax about their auto pilot advertising leading people to believe its more like a planes autopilot than what it actually is a much safer version of cruise control its likely already saved some lives but its also endangeredkilled others check out tesla barrier lust to see teslas that steer straight into barriers im much more likely to give tesla a pass because i believe their testing is more thorough and theres plenty of proof that teslas have saved lives if you compare either company to waymo youll find their track records arent as impressive waymo has gone fully autonomous rather than the semi autonomous route there have not been any waymo deaths yet and its because theyve put a value on caution instead of i dont doubt that a waymo car will someday be involved in a deadly accident but at that point im going to assume it was something a human driver couldnt have predicted either unless facts state otherwise i believe in giving credit where its due and not every self driving car company is out to save lives some are being far too loose in their safety standards in the name of potential profits

1365,or we could just rig up all vehicles to not operate if a cell phone is detected within reach of the drivers seat or if the driver fails a breathalyzer but no lets remove self determination from our lives entirely because a bunch of people kill themselves by driving like an asshole every year

1369,i know this may sound weird but if i were to die from a car hitting me id rather it be a human at least with a human you can say it was an accident with a machine its deliberate in the machines head its driver in danger pedestrian deemed acceptable loss to protect driver

1371,i feel like we currently have the technology to make cars safe in the event of a major crash we just dont apply it bc its inconvienient or looks dumb like a full body strap in
1372,my problem is the concept of a self driving car having to choose between the occupants and pedestrians until im sure the vehicle im in wont choose to kill me instead of plowing into a crowd i wont get in one of the damn things
1373,didnt the last few cars kill people because they were jaywalking
1374,self drive is yrs away no one is even close to doing it in real life situations driving is only partly a skill its also a test of human understanding
1375,seems like the main issue is the car being responsible for the blame would it differ from industrial accidents where machinery killed the operator
1376,seems like the main issue is the car being responsible for the blame would it differ from industrial accidents where machinery killed the operator
1377,but who will be to blame if a self driving car kills someone
1378,yep the fact that there are few enough accidents involving autopilot that they still make the news should be an indication that they are safer than human drivers the autopilot is programmed to give a shit about other cars on the road humans not so much
1379,though when self driving cars kill people will we still need auto insurance pretty sure the lawyers will go after that big money which will be auto manufacturer
1380,i find it interesting that people are freaking out about self driving car accidents weve only had them on the roads for a few years look at how far weve come from those late early brick sized mobile phones now image where self driving cars will be in years
1381,heres a video follow up of the accident involving the uber self driving car that killed a bicyclist not too long ago youtubedbtablcno from my understating uber had disabled a bunch of features that made the car actually self driving specially conscious

1383,yes they will kill people but not anywhere near as much as people kill people
1384,thats how many americans die in car crashes each year even if self driving cars kill people a year that still reduces traffic deaths by

1388,if they get them safe enough the manufacturers can build payouts to those killed into their business model then ill start to believe they are ready for mass deployment
1389,human beings are far too defective to avoid being killed by something that has special programming to avoid killing them the vast bulk of the legal code exists because adult human beings cannot be trusted to make good decisions there are valid philosophical arguments to be made about many of these laws if not the majority of them nonetheless whether it is commerce or crossing a street short sighted poor choices seem to be unavoidable
1390,just get rid of the most likely be an improvement over a human drivers ability a lady killed herself and four college kids in a head on collision that resulted in a fiery explosion when she entered the highway going the wrong way its not like she was old or drunk or distracted she was driving the speed limit just not reading signs and making a disastrously negligent slip and now four kids and a mother of two are dead self driving cars lack the reckless me first bullshit that results in tons of accidents my concern though is how well they will mix with human drivers

1392,yeah its insane how much death we tolerate as normal on the roads with human drivers but anecdotal accidents with automated systems are treated like some epic disaster its the same craziness that happens with human spaceflight a chopper with marines crashes its one day of news a space shuttle blew up with astronauts and the entire space program ground to a halt for years afterward and today we dont even have human space launch because nasa is insisting on proving the safety of things before even flying them experimentally meanwhile how many people just died on the roads in the time it took me to write this irrational priorities hold humanity back we tolerate death where its least meaningful and act like its an unacceptable sacrifice where its highly justified to take risks and deal with the consequences

1396,that artical headline is just bullshit there have been multiple car crashes of autonomous vehicles that could have been prevented with a human driver the technology will continue to improve but the headline is just a false claim
1397,that artical headline is just bullshit there have been multiple car crashes of autonomous vehicles that could have been prevented with a human driver the technology will continue to improve but the headline is just a false claim
1398,thats great unless you are one of those killed or the ais learn to like killing
1399,agree with the message but in the article itself theres a couple nitpicks and things to expand on the risk of human drivers next we need to acknowledge just how bad human drivers are at controlling their own vehicles and how they compare to autonomous vehicles in there were vehicular fatalities just in the united states a stanford review found that percent of accidents are caused at least in part by human error whether thats overcorrecting falling prey to a distraction or drinking alcohol before getting behind the wheel some quick math tells you thats lives that were lost because a human behind the wheel of a car made a mistake with similar numbers year over year here they used the words and how they human drivers compare to autonomous vehicles but in the statistic they provide they dont account for the ratio of autonomous vehicles to manually operated vehicles that would be the more interesting and relevant statistic and we could really see if self driving cars are less accident prone also this quote in the section self driving cars are going to kill people period no matter what people are going to die at the hands of an autonomous vehicle the quote marks seem to imply it but i think its important to note the distinction that theres a difference between the autopilot being partiallyat fault in an accident and the autopilot doing everything perfectly in an unavoidable accident occurring because of unfortunate outside circumstances if people recognise that distinction itll lead to more objectivity and less clickbait

1402,and who is legaly reaponcible for a self driving car kill
1403,if driverless cars kill peopleyear in america thatd be a huge improvement over the current traffic fatality rate
1404,but even our most underdeveloped models will most likely be an improvement over a human drivers ability seems like an odd thing to say when a self driving car literally just killed someone in a crash that would have been prevented by a human driver
1405,but even our most underdeveloped models will most likely be an improvement over a human drivers ability seems like an odd thing to say when a self driving car literally just killed someone in a crash that would have been prevented by a human driver
1406,plus hundreds of thousands of people died to the original cars im guessing and so far the death toll for autonomous cars is somewhere under as far as i am aware if you couldnt tell im kinda guessing my stats as terrible as it sounds losing a couple hundred people because of the development of autonomous cars isnt that bad
1407,yeah no humans are actually excellent drivers incredibly good as long as theyre doing the actual driving and not fucking about have you ever seen pilots view from f or redbull air race shits insane and they very rarely crash absolute majority of road incidents are due to driver error if we remove the human from that seat then id expect all associated causes for a crash to go away with it i dont want an sdc thats safer than the average human because average human texts behind the wheel goes over the limit when its not safe to do so overtakes on blind corners etc i want sdc thats safer than a really good attentive responsible driver if they cant provide that well then i guess ill stick to driving myself
1408,who does my estate get to sue when im killed by a driverless car
1409,the issue isnt do much that theyll kill people people are generally ok with that concept i think the issue is that when they kill people we dont currently have a sensible way to describe whose fault it is
1410,im sure op is comfortable making that remark about inevitable deaths since the probability of himher getting killed is really low but is heshe willing to be okay if hisher death was inevitable
1411,the problem preventing this fact from being accepted by many is that its very hard for human beings to accept the bigger picture when it affects them we love to point out why the girl hiding from the movies serial killer under the bed instead of leaving the house is an idiot and we love to think think that we wouldnt have been killed in an accident involving a self driving car if only we had been driving ourselves even if statistically incorrect i think this rings especially true if a casualty or injury is inflicted on a third party as a result of anothers car failing

1413,exactly hearing people pull put because a person died to a self driving car in a situation that a human would be even less equipt to deal with is frustrating as hell
1414,bad drivers will drive badly at least some of them wont kill anyone else if they have autopilot and similar systems watching over them
1415,liability is the word here whos at fault people will die on the roads either way but theres a process in place to punish peoples carelessness far from perfect but it exists whos at fault when theres nobody in control
1416,if i am killed by a self driving car who do i sue
1417,bit confused out the outrage when a one self driving car crashes and someone dies is nothing in comparison to the amount of car crashes from people driving and dying have happened in the same space of time

1420,less death is still death but its less death i dont know of any humans with ladar or super fast processing power that can avoid many accidents that a human wouldnt just cause some people will die doesnt mean we need to scrap the whole idea in the end if it causes fewer deaths than human drivers would thats saving lives as far as insurance why not everyone just have a low rate for their car based on historical accident rates for that model itd be a lot cheaper and much more acceptable since theres no way the automaker would take the blame

1422,i agree with this article if they are going to kill people we might as well push them in a way that they kill the right kind of people
1423,if these things are going to be as safe as they say they will there will be a side effect to that fewer car accidents means fewer organ transplants most transplant organs come from mvas one hundred thousand people die every year while waiting on a list for an organ transplant now and the longer you are on the list the less chance you have of being healthy enough for the transplant should the organ become available if you are rich you can get screened at multiple facilities around the world and get on more than one list in other countries more poor and middle class will die not from car accidents but from not being able to access a suitable donor in time

1425,honestly this sub is kind of insane when it comes to this stuff this us the scariest thing ever not because of people dying in traffic but who is to blame who does the ethical responsibility for that decision test on the field of ethics has asked for centuries whose life is worth preserving in the railtrain scenario and now car producers just answer based on profit since nobody would buy a car that kills its driver it will always swerve into pedestrians to save the driver
1426,thats the thing about people they never think rationally something like people are killed in car crashes each year in the us but no one bats an eye person dies by self driving car and everyone loses their shit even if self driving cars get the number down to k theyd still be doing better then people wouldnt they

1430,some of you may die but thats a risk im willing to take
1431,it really depends on the company waymo has gone more miles than anyone and not had a single accident that was their fault the others have had problems and why with waymo so far ahead it does worry me what they will do we had gm settled recently with the motor bike rider they knocked off his bike they were ticketed a couple of weeks ago for dangerous driving around a pedestrian gm settles lawsuit with motorcyclist over crash with self driving chevy bolt then we had tesla and uber actually kill people waymo with k cars now on order for their service is probably only going to make gm and the others do even more dangerous things

1434,to common thinking one death from an autonomous car outweighs killed by dui so i agree with this post
1435,us in there were accidents or per day there are roughly drivers on the road at any time most making two trips on the road to and from work which means a chance of having a crash at any given time
1436,us in there were accidents or per day there are roughly drivers on the road at any time most making two trips on the road to and from work which means a chance of having a crash at any given time
1437,i would love to know how many accidents per mile there are on the other hand im not sure if society will prefer less people dying on the road but more unemployment
1438,but even our most underdeveloped models will most likely be are already an improvement over a human drivers ability tesla may be going about it haphazardly but have you seen the statistics the last generation of software reduced crashes in teslas by and their goal for this generation is thats including when autopilot is on and off their software has the ability to take the wheel to avoid a crash and the compilations on youtube are great tbh seriously its news when a self driving vehicle kills someone for the same reason its news when a disappears it almost never happens

1441,the problem is whos accountant for that accident right now it is easy since drivers have total control but even with this there are problems to get properly accountability so insurances can pay what ever needs to be apid so i dont wanna start thinking about the nightmare atuonomous drive will bring
1442,im going to be starting my masters in control systems engineering with a focus in autonomous vehicle communication in about a year my firm believer about self driving vehicles is that they are safer but only in a system composed mostly of autonomous vehicles reduce risk of human error create a self referencing grid ect this will never happen because the cost of the technology keeps it out of financial reach of most of the population so people will continue to die and we will continue this debate till were blue in the face
1443,we will never eliminate all deaths from vehicles there are just too many people and cars interacting the shear numbers involved almost demand that some bad things are going to happen im ok with pedestrian deaths by self driving cars as long as its still less than the deaths caused by human driven cars one person could die everyday and it would still be the safest form of transportation in human history ill even take it a step further we could have to sacrifice one person everyday to feed the bloodlust of the deranged automated cars in order to keep their kind in check and it would still be the better option the highest fatality numbers from automated cars will be fractions of the lowest numbers of fatalities from human driven cars
1444,seriously thousands of people die in human driven car crashes every day and nobody seems to mind but as soon as a self driving car kills one single person everyone loses their minds

1448,this is one of those cases where the majority needs to be forced to accept the tech for its own good against its non sensical instincts and cognitive biases oh its something new lets apply above average scrutiny where previously we didnt even think about the dangers at all i see it happen with new tech like electric vehicles as well people using gasoline like theres no tomorrow but when tesla comes around the corner everybody is suddenly very concerned with the amount of precious earths you need to create a battery ffs weve been killing the planet to get you from a to b as fast as possible and you didnt give a damn and suddenly youre concerned with lifecycle analysis how much f ing oil spills and co emissions does it take for you to realize we need to leave the oil where it is right now hypocrisy wherever you look
1449,i wish everyone would understand this because autonomous vehicle deaths absolutely are going to happen and the media is absolutely going to sensationalize each and every one every death will be a national news story and the more infrequently these deaths happen the more news worthy they are when the do occur people like to ignore the hundreds that are killed every single day by manually controlled vehicles
1450,please dont take this as insensitive but humans are already killing each other with vehicles autonomous vehicles will never get duis road rage or get tired autonomous technology will only improve our vehicle mortality rates
1451,essentially our society is facing a real life trolley problem do we take action and kill a few people or do nothing and kill many more apparently were leaning towards the second choice
1452,suppose one person was killed each day in each state for an entire year that would be deaths that year still reducing vehicle fatalities by compared to last years data wikipedia enmwikipediaorgwikimotor_vehicle_fatality_rate_in_us_by_year as i think about the deaths most likely to be caused by a transition to automation i believe it will become more obvious that out of a result of human error more often than not
1453,i want my car to drive me i think it will be another decade till its ready for the public but it is a really good thing thousands of people wont die because we have autonomous driving cars
1454,planes have killed people didnt stop the airline industry people have this weird expectation that there should be zero deaths with something and its bizarre like a self driving car hit someone shut it down one incident compared to how many incidents every day by humans seems okay to me
1455,early development ai for self driving cars is a better driver than the majority of humans there may be a few more accidents at the start than when they are properly trained but it will still be a reduction humans are poor drivers and they confirm that fact every day why do people insist on debating the obvious
1456,the only thing i have a problem with is my car deciding to kill me if it thinks thats a favorable outcome if i get into an accident my car needs to focus on protecting me and their car needs to focus on protecting them
1457,the only thing i have a problem with is my car deciding to kill me if it thinks thats a favorable outcome if i get into an accident my car needs to focus on protecting me and their car needs to focus on protecting them
1458,still the legalities of this are huge the first humans killed by an autonomous mechanical entity
1459,like drones the military kind kill people today oh yeah the government takes control over the vehicle and kills somebody they dont like blame the self driving car we have to accept that they will occasionally kill people
1460,every time someone mentions that someone was killed by a tesla on autopilot or whatever my reaction is always so fucking what how many people were killed by regular cars it seems like the most important step to all of this is going to be removing human drivers from the road entirely
1461,at the very least im pretty sure were not going to hear of an autonomous vehicle which has been involved in an accident failing a breathalyzer test that has to count for something
1462,at least self driving technology would improve and learn from the thousands of mistakes made around the network until it decides fuck it kill them all
1463,i mean so do non self driving cars lol its not like weve had no car accidents all these years but i figure the number of accidents will drop significantly with self driving maybe not pedestrian related accidents though
1464,everytime someone dies by a self driving car there will be people complaining that if there was a human driving the car it would not have happened but i think it could also be true if we flip the coin that the car could have saved that family of in the car in front because the person behind them was drunk or fell asleep behind the wheel idk its a tricky situation
1465,people have a particular horror of being killed by machineskiller robots dont sound so far fetched these days one of the reasons we arent so afraid of being killed by human drivers it that another human driver has an interest in avoiding any accidentthey might be injured or killed themselves after all we have an inherent level of trust in our own mutually shared instincts for self preservationbut a machine has no skin in the game literally

1469,yeah statistically humans will always be the greater of two evils but hold on ten self driving cars have been in accidents lets outlaw these maniacal machines and let us kill other drivers instead makessense
1470,yeah statistically humans will always be the greater of two evils but hold on ten self driving cars have been in accidents lets outlaw these maniacal machines and let us kill other drivers instead makessense
1471,fuckin retarded been driving for years and havent gotten a ticket or even close to crashing not giving up my power to drive any time soon for this bullshit
1472,million people die a year in wrecks if that goes down to people or even people with ai cars its worth it
1473,so long as they kill fewer people than human drivers do im good
1474,this is like that scenario that teaches morality if you could push one person off a bridge to prevent a train from killing five people would you do it it will be interesting to see how the future of self driving cars will be impacted by the fear of the inevitability of them causing death when we perceive accidents caused by humans as preventable

1476,i think a problem is that it will introduce a random factor you have no control if there is an accident whereas in the same situation where you had a control the accident could have been avoided
1477,joe rogan and kevin smith talked about this current state of robot drivers have a higher kill percentage than humans theyll get it right one day but better hope too many people arent killed first
1478,i think the real problem with avs is going to be when one does kill someone and someone now needs to determine was the av or the deceased persons more at fault if it is decided that it was the av who is responsible the owner of the vehicle or the company or companies behind the avs safety equipment which may be a lot more than just one company and this is with a simplified scenario depending on what the final technology requires what happens if external sensors or signal broadcasters are required by avs just to function reliably im thinking especially of snowy or icy conditions where the cars on board sensors may not be able to detect the edge or center of a road reliably right now roads and road signals are mostly paid for by the public if an av kills someone and it was icy and there is a question about whether some road implanted signaling device failed does that make that citycountystate partially responsible this is likely to provide for entirely new departments of lawyers being required in many legal firms to handle the increased demand for both prosecuting and defense lawyers
1479,id prefer to die from some crappy driver than a robot so belittling
1480,wait until people die during the ride and show up to their destination dead
1481,you can make this argument for almost anything surgery will kill people at a certain rate imagine if everytime someone died during a cancer operation it made national news stop removing all cancers
1482,you can make this argument for almost anything surgery will kill people at a certain rate imagine if everytime someone died during a cancer operation it made national news stop removing all cancers
1483,i feel like people are so afraid of change that as soon as there is one bad sign they freak out bad stuff happens regardless of technology people die every day because of human error the future is autonomous cars so its time to embrace the future and move it along quicker because the faster we move it along the faster that it can be safe
1484,some people will die in a country with a second amendment and we need to accept that
1485,i think we should consider that its worse for a human to die when he or she has no control over it an autonomous car killing a human is worse than a human killing them selves due to error he or she can can have free will over their error which results in death a human in an autonomous car has no control over their potential death
1486,i think we should consider that its worse for a human to die when he or she has no control over it an autonomous car killing a human is worse than a human killing them selves due to error he or she can can have free will over their error which results in death a human in an autonomous car has no control over their potential death
1487,pehaps we should have self driving war machines first humans seem to accept new things more easily when they were explicity desinged to kill and were then made safer and more useful
1488,thank you i have been telling people this for a while now there will always be accidents but in the end humans will always cause way more than self driving cars currently the media is part of the problem they always highlight when a tesla crashes but never mention how many miles they have also driven safetly not to mention some of the crashes are indeed cause by human error
1489,thank you i have been telling people this for a while now there will always be accidents but in the end humans will always cause way more than self driving cars currently the media is part of the problem they always highlight when a tesla crashes but never mention how many miles they have also driven safetly not to mention some of the crashes are indeed cause by human error
1490,thank you i have been telling people this for a while now there will always be accidents but in the end humans will always cause way more than self driving cars currently the media is part of the problem they always highlight when a tesla crashes but never mention how many miles they have also driven safetly not to mention some of the crashes are indeed cause by human error
1491,some of you will die but that is a sacrifice i am willing to make
1492,who said that we even want self driving cars i love driving simply being transported from a to b would kill all the fun
1493,i think what people dont like about it is they have no control over their death if i drive like a twat and end up killing myself i have it coming but me sitting on my morning commute reading the paper and then suddenly something happens so the car runs me off the road or head first into a lorry is not really an enjoyable thought
1494,isnt this the same logic gun rights advocates use accept that some people will die for a greater good
1495,telling people to accept that self driving cars will kill people is an ethical and moral nonsense there are laws and punishments for being a bad driver bad driving includes killing people which is punished the only way autonomous vehicles will become better drivers will be if that regime of punishment applies to the vehicles or their corporate owners until self driving cars are better drivers in an environment of human drivers they will not really be better drivers at all the entire idea that underdeveloped models will most likely be an improvement is a fundamentally flawed premise purely because the standard has been set by human drivers already
1496,this is so true i cant understand why people freak out about the news stories about somebody that dies with an accident in which a self driving vehicle is involved when people die per day in regular cars enmwikipediaorgwikimotor_vehicle_fatality_rate_in_us_by_year

1498,tldr scary to use humans to test new tech the world is desensitized to loss of human life similar to companies under the fda autonomous vehicle companies should prove their products are safe and effective before using you might die but thats okay slogan this is terrifying ideology for example a woman killed her newborn in a town elsewhere in my state by shaking it because it wouldnt eat the ct scan showed six blunt force injuries on the brain everyone finds this abhorrent how is abortion not on the same page a human fetus is a human too i digresspeople die in cars and that is a terrible thing to happen someone dies in an autonomous vehicle and thats for the cause someone getting killed is such a desensitized event in the world now that the selling point for future tech egautonomous vehicles is that some people will die during testing and that is okay some people died at sandy hook elementary was that okay in order to improve security at schools no and if you think it was you extremely need to rethink some things about yourself heres the reality of the situation loss of life is never okay every person is unique and wonderful and beautifully made never should there be technology or ideas that we explore where human mortality is not the utmost concern autonomous vehicles shouldnt be sold under the notion that youre an early user so you may die but thats a sacrifice we are willing to make because our product is better at driving than you a la lord farquad youtubehikuxfcsreu its nonsensical death comes for us all thats the consequence of our sin yes we accept that but sacrificing people for technological advancements isnt that illegal not to mention hugely unethical enmwikipediaorgwikiunethical_human_experimentation read the united states section the kefauver harris drug amendment to the federal food drug consumer act requires companies to prove safety and effectiveness of their products theyre prioritizing human life and wellness now as law requires why arent autonomous car companies trying to sell their products with the focal selling point being the best safety and effectiveness too surely this is being investigated surely the autonomous vehicle companies arent experimenting why should we accept a product that isnt proven effective and safe in the highest degree i dont think we should accept it not until its been shown to be safe there are good and bad drivers on the roads every time we get in a car we risk our lives but we take penicillin because we know its been proven effective and safe and labeled as such i drive my particular car because its been proven safe and effective at keeping me that way i buckle my seatbelt for the same reason its proven to be safe and effective why shouldnt an autonomous vehicle be subject to the same parameters im okay with downvotes felt like adding my two pence this is a hot topic rall we need to be discussing this

1500,not really fair to the aware and cautious people who will die from no fault of their own
1501,will i it rely on a life score that determines if my life is worth saving or not in a crash no thanks but id rather self driving cars never happen well all just become lazy slobs if that happens
1502,the cs industry is tainted by the same issues every other industry is in some ways employees are not getting smarter in some cases dumber sooooo when youre designing a self driving car and youre a dirtbag company like uber should we let them employ shoddy workers so theyll save a dime workers that will and did kill someone
1503,hmmm in other autopilot type environments such as aircraft ships etc there are two variables that wont translate well into the autonomous vehicle situation cars are maintained in a vastly different manner professional maintenance teams of highly trained persons ensure all the systems are operating properly and even then things fail with the home user neglecting repairs maintenance there will never be the same level as in the professional transportation industry think along the lines of an old unsafe car burning oil because the owner doesnt maintain the car people will never be as diligently trained as the professional transport industry they wont care theyll play around with the technology and cause general mayhem think your neighbor burning rubber you son that keeps getting into accidents or those motorcycle riders that are aggressive to the point of being dangerous there will need to be a fundamental change in these two arenas to have a functional safe and efficient av
1504,i was thinking this just recently i see so many headlines saying self driving car hits x and i cant help but think how ludicrous that headline would be if a person was behind the wheel man has accident while driving like yeah no shit sherlock the worst part ive seem multiple versions of this story where it turns out that the vehicle was actually in manual mode at the time so the headline actually becomes outright misleading
1505,uhhhhyeah k people killed on the road every year in the us any improvement on that is not only good but a testament to how the government couldnt save lives if they were paid to do it which they are which they dont
1506,oh no they might kill someone as if people dont do that in huge numbers already driving im willing to bet theyre better at driving than we are in majority of cases perhaps if traffic is directed differently due to construction or similar it might be better to take over due to it being off the predicted path but that seems obvious
1507,an improvement over a human drivers ability except captchas s im honestly sorry but i think even the most underdeveloped models will most likely be an improvement over some human drivers abilities some of us have gone our entire lives without being in an accident when ai can rock a vehicle out of snow anticipate oncoming and upcoming potential problems shoulders uneven terrain etc then then perhaps theyll be an improvement over a human driver yes accidents with ai will occur and in good conditions theyll function safely and autonomously but the processing power needed for improvisationforesight is a ways off in my humble opinion
1508,for the press and other people who cant count death by autonomous vehicle is equal to oh deaths by accidents in human operated vehicles
1509,not gonna lie but i rather take the few extreme cases of stupid causing a self driving car to crash than the several thousands of stupid people on the road every day causing crashes and crashing into shit and people i trust something that cant get drunk or be allowed onto the road with a mental problem alot more than someone that has those things
1510,not gonna lie but i rather take the few extreme cases of stupid causing a self driving car to crash than the several thousands of stupid people on the road every day causing crashes and crashing into shit and people i trust something that cant get drunk or be allowed onto the road with a mental problem alot more than someone that has those things
1511,our shits gonna kill people fuckin get over it good approach
1512,idk how i feel about this i get that theres less of a chance of me dying but i wont have control over it id rather be driving the car myself and getting into an accident than having the car do it for me is that a weird thing to say
1513,no we dont have to accept that we can just build transit systems that are intrinsically safe instead of retaining the horse and buggy without the horse now with a computer trying desperately to emulate a human which is brutally hard skytran for instance if you have to design in criteria like ok we have an emergency who should the car kill pedeistrains or the occupants youre designing a shitty ass useless system that has no justification for existing i just cant believe this massive blind spot everyone seems to have cars are a bad technology for transporting people theyre also a very bad technology for transporting goods both those things can be done immensely better with something like maglev rail passive or active maglev depending on size people traffic on the local plane should be walking cycling or electric buggies that move pretty slow the transit systems that move people further should be at least meters in the air to make collisions impossible why wouldnt we build faster safer and cleaner options naah its too hard and you have to build too much lets just keep maintaining these stupid ass expensive roads and kill people on them with metal boxes hurtling out of control that makes so much more sense what
1514,airbags can kill people but we put them in cars because we know that they kill fewer people than the alternative
1515,children are being killed in schools every month in this country no worries well get used to it
1516,does the person inside the car get the kill or is it the car manufacturer get it
1517,and were all ok with that until it kills someone we knowlove
1518,i think the sentiment we should have is automated cars will kill people before they get perfected the current phrasing implies our automated vehicles will always kill people and i honestly think with the plethera of technology available to us we should eventually be able to solve all issues with maybe the exception of the suicidal jumper
1519,cool cant wait until the robots kill you im scared
1520,the real issue is taking that portion of the economy which can be as high as and ripping it out of the hands of the in a time when social safety nets are under attack that will definitely kill a lot more people than driving ever did
1521,not introducing self driving cars will kill many many more people
1522,its weird people die every day from driving thats dying not getting in an accident and walking away its not even a close comparison how bad humans are at driving sure some of us are good but seriously people are shit at driving the future cars will have literally millions of times not experience at driving than any of us will have in our life time
1523,its weird people die every day from driving thats dying not getting in an accident and walking away its not even a close comparison how bad humans are at driving sure some of us are good but seriously people are shit at driving the future cars will have literally millions of times not experience at driving than any of us will have in our life time
1524,this is true like with fun fair rides having a guest fly out of his restrainer in a roller coaster draws more attention than a busdriver tumbling down a mountainside killing half his passengers
1525,as boring as it sounds there is a significant discussion currently being held in the risk management profession of moving liability in any auto accident to the actual manufacturer of an autonomous vehicle as opposed to the driver this would completely change the way personal auto insurance operates and therefore the profitability of auto insurance carriers
1526,that would be the question the insurance agents work with they have the telemetry from one car and the statements from the driver and possible witnesses and can work their way forward from there the same will happen when two autonomous cars hit each other or kill someone the only difference between having a human driving and a computer is that the computer remembers what happened and not an interpretation of what happened
1527,trick question entities pay the insurance bill before a crash the insurance makes payouts after the crash
1528,better question is fault if an electric car strikes and kills someone who is responsible
1529,interesting question that is not really relevant to the point automated vehicles will reduce the number of accidents to a value approaching zero dramatically reducing cost in dollars and lives the cost of insurance is going to go down by over time and youre worried about who is going to foot the bill
1530,it will happen so rarely that the owners of the fleet of vehicles or the company that makes them will happily pay for all the bills and a nice pay out to the families it will buy them pr an alleviate any fears of people buying these cars and ending up screwed by a in a million accident least if thats not what they do they are fucking idiots simply paying for it will be the smallest expense in operating a fleet or manufacturing and selling these cars to the public it really isnt going to happen much and they are going to be making so much fucking money
1531,a couple years ago all the big players in the self driving car business came forward one at a time and basically said they would self insure all of their own cars basically no car owner is going to be willing to own a self driving car if they would have to pay for its mistakes and theres a pretty good chance that even if individual people did sign up for that it wouldnt take many expensive accidents before the courts would start assigning damages to the car companies also transportation is one of the few areas in the us that still has relatively strong consumer protection regulations partly because the national highway transportation safety board has veto power over which vehicles get to use the highway and the nhtsb would insist on the manufacturers running the insurance im not positive how exactly the insurance is funded whether these companies are parking the risk with third party risk assessment companies for a smoother potentially lower price or if theyre just going to flat out pay any damages from the company slush fund
1532,it depends who the government decides to put priority of life on in the event of a crash me or the general population if my car acts in my interest then its no different than anything else i foot the bill if my car acts in the interest of everyone then i aint footing shit
1533,what they are also considering is to connect the insurance to the individual car and not the person such that a car which has made no crashes in the last years will get a cheaper insurance or a car from a manufacturer with cars with a great safety record will get a lower monthly fee
1534,what they are also considering is to connect the insurance to the individual car and not the person such that a car which has made no crashes in the last years will get a cheaper insurance or a car from a manufacturer with cars with a great safety record will get a lower monthly fee
1535,insurance companies will surely develop a new policy for that given that they are said to be safer than drivers they are therefore better for insurances it means more profit for them i predict there will be at least three kind of insurances for self driving cars the one were the manufacturer themselves become an insurer a car insurance where you are not allowed to drive the car which will be much cheaper than the cheapest one at the momentless accident means more money for the insurer a mix of both where you have a manufacturer insurance and a normal car insurance who is liable will depend on who was driving at the time of the accident
1536,thats the thing the car is always watching and has a ton of video and data to pretty much recreate the accident to know who was at fault and im sure they have insurance just like any other vehicle
1537,and who is to blame for wrongful death in a court case the human in the car the program etc this is a philosophical question of course but when a human is killed in a car accident and the driver is taken to court criminally or civil they are found at fault or not who or what is accountable in this future
1538,and who is to blame for wrongful death in a court case the human in the car the program etc this is a philosophical question of course but when a human is killed in a car accident and the driver is taken to court criminally or civil they are found at fault or not who or what is accountable in this future
1539,i would think the owner of the car would still be responsible if you get in an accident because your tire has a blow out its not the tire manufacturers who pay its the owner of the car
1540,if tesla is ever going to be true autopilot tesla will partner with insurance companies and offer insurance directly to you with a guarantee that the premium wont increase after a crash caused by the autopilot if the tesla cars have much fewer accidents the insurance fee will be very low compared to that of non autopilot cars
1541,if tesla is ever going to be true autopilot tesla will partner with insurance companies and offer insurance directly to you with a guarantee that the premium wont increase after a crash caused by the autopilot if the tesla cars have much fewer accidents the insurance fee will be very low compared to that of non autopilot cars
1542,also upsetting getting killed by a texting driver a drunk driver a sleepy driver or a reckless driver even if humans are better for now at certain driving tasks there are just so many kinds of distractions and flaws and reckless stupid emotions that automated cars arent capable of its also nice that they dont necessarily require line of sight to see and arent restricted to single direction human eyes degrees of sensory information across a wide swath of visual spectrum plus proximity sensors lidar perhaps distributed inter car communication protocols the robo cars are gonna be a lot better than humans quickly
1543,i think it would be kind of an interesting way to die obviously horrible and nobody really wants to die like that but id rather be killed by something technologically cool than falling down the stairs or being constipated for like a month or something
1544,i think it would be kind of an interesting way to die obviously horrible and nobody really wants to die like that but id rather be killed by something technologically cool than falling down the stairs or being constipated for like a month or something
1545,i bet youll be just as pissed as youd be if you were killed by another human
1546,would you be pissed if you were killed by a drunk driver
1547,but less will die so its not a sacrifice its crazy to me that people already expect self driving cars to be perfect its a messy chaotic world and accidents will happen but if the overall chance of an accident goes down its a better world self driving cars cant fall asleep text drink or get road rage
1548,but less will die so its not a sacrifice its crazy to me that people already expect self driving cars to be perfect its a messy chaotic world and accidents will happen but if the overall chance of an accident goes down its a better world self driving cars cant fall asleep text drink or get road rage
1549,how many people will die from reckless driving while we sit around trying to figure out liability of autonomous cars is it really better to have people die per year than have far fewer with less of a contingency plan for blame to that extent by accepting the current death toll in lieu of just rolling out driverless vehicles are we putting an actual pricetag on a human life
1550,news at people died today when an ai driverless car ran into a crowd of people at a nickelblack concert
1551,do the same thing to the people who work for the company that built the car or just not be a low key psychopathic killer
1552,ill bet that eventually truckingride providing companies uber etc will pressure governments to pass legislation once it becomes more widespread the general public will come to accept autonomous driving as normal as well as the unfortunate deathsaccidents that will also occur thats not to say there will be tons of public push back for probably decades
1553,youre missing something vital our brains are built to take things for granted to be efficient above all else we ignore monotonous noisessights we dont pay attention to our own stationary bodies and we distract our bored selves if i sat you in a room for hours a day and told you to push a button when a cat gets too close to a conveyor belt but you havent seen a cat in weeks youre going to read a book or goof off on your phone or take a nap get yourself in one of these vehicles for a month hour commute and youll quickly find that youre as attentive and ready as an elementary kid on a school bus
1554,there is a good chance that you might die to some other humans mistake so you cant really control who is responsible
1555,i do want a self driving car but i also want the appropriate person to aceept liability for an accident you cant just blame the victim you cant just refuse an insurance payout and if you built a self driving car your liability does extend to preventing the next victim from having the same accident in addition to that of depriving the victim of their life or property
1556,i get it you think you are in control and that youre not at risk but you most definitely are good drivers die every day by the dozens and this technology will reduce the fatality rate immensely yes it introduces a new agent into the equation robo driver and that robot wont be perfect but it will be better its natural to fear this new risk and to want to stick with what youre used to but the net risk is going to go down big time allow me to illustrate hypothetically lets say your chances of dying of cancer in the next years is but a new free pill came out on the market that can almost eliminate your risk of cancer dropping your probability of cancer death to however that pill also adds a side effect that may cause it to actually give you cancer the probability of that happening is so this new pill lowers the probability of cancer death by a huge amount but in very rare cases it actually causes cancer death should you take that pill of course you should take that pill which will reduce your probability of cancer death from to it would be dumb to get caught up on the fact that the pill adds a new risk of cancer when it more than offsets that new risk by eliminating of the current risk the pill way improves your probability of avoiding death overall so dont be a dummy use it by the same token we should adopt the new safer form of transportation sure the robot could fuck up and kill you but the odds of it happening will be lower than very good human drivers yourself included killing you there will be no reward for taking the extra mortality risk associated a human driver the machines are already better than humans at most maneuvers and it is a matter of time until they dominate us across the board it will be very soon only hard headedness fear of change distrust of machines and ego will hold this process back prepare yourselves to take this damned pill people it will almost certainly improve your life and the lives of others like the elderly it will reduce fatalities and injuries it will solve traffic jams it will be soooooo much better embrace it

1558,while in most cases with non self driving cars one or more human drivers is responsible for a crash there are certainly cases where a car malfunction is the cause in such cases its still possible for the malfunction to be the drivers or owners fault a result of improper maintenance for example but if it can be proven that a faulty design is responsible the cars manufacturer can definitely be held liable for financial damages in a self driving car theres still a possibility that the driver may be held responsible due to their operation of the car or its maintenance so drivers may still need to be insured corporations certainly are risk averse but they can collect revenue from the sale that can be applied to the cost of liability insurance a safer self driving car will cost less for the manufacturer to lay off financial risks to an insurer we can only hope that arrangement stays in place so the public isnt forced to pay for the risks and costs of poorly performing self driving designs for example if manufacturers get government to hold them harmless for crashes in self driving cars the public will have to eat the cost either by driverowners insurance or people just plain not being compensated for being killed or injured

1561,to be fair people die everyday because of human operated cars and its entirely beleiveable that automated cars would be less prone to error than people
1562,i do not think that a self driving car currently is even close to avoiding wrecks as me see this is the problem everyone thinks they are better than the average no matter how good you truly are everyone thinks they are that good yet k people a year die
1563,it is because the responsibility of driving and all the consequences spoken about in this article you know like killing someone is now the manufacturers it would be like saying that dying on a rollercoaster was the fault of the rider not the owner of the theme park
1564,your trusting the thousands of other strangers every day when you drive you dont have to die because of your screw up you are more likely to die because of someone elses screw up already an old lady ran up the curb thinking she was hitting the break when she floored the gas and smashed my mom through a brick wall breaking dozens of bones and causing internal bleeding thats not my moms screw up thats shitty human drivers
1565,the logical solution would be to protect the vehicle and its occupants from injury if it prioritized saving the person running out in front then people would eventually just take to the assumption that this will happen every time and not take pedestrian safety so seriously and thus increase accidents over time its not just what happens in that moment its the statistical human behavior change that evolves from it
1566,this question is so tedious self driving vehicles arent going to be doing any complicated decision making its going to be doing absolutely zero decision making based on morals its going to be following relatively simple instructions in case of a threat such as swerve if possible otherwise stay in the lane and decelerate as much as possible humans are absolute shite in emergency situations so theyre certainly not going to be worse than humans in an emergency plus im willing to reckon you didnt spend a lot of time in a morality class before they let you get your license these situations are already really rare with self driving cars theyll be even more rare were talking about the kind of situation you might expect to occur once in a thousand lifetimes of driving to the extent vehicles can be programmed to minimize the loss of human life thats a good thing for you even if it is lives outside the vehicle because youre more likely to be the person outside the vehicle than in its a whole bunch of nothing the true immorality would be letting an extra million people die every year because self driving vehicles arent perfect
1567,i would counter with this by saying the automated car will do exactly what a human would do in this situation break and swerve to avoid the obstacle except the automated vehicle would do it with a higher degree of accuracy and much faster than a human could its not like humans have complex moral thoughts about an imminent accident occurring you just break and swerve or worse dont break at all
1568,what about a drunk driver slamming into the back of a sober person killing them
1569,i think this is close i think most driving deaths arent completely random a person who drinks and drives or texts and drives are more likely to die in general theres the assumption that a driver can do things through good habits and good skills to minimize their chances of dying however a person in an automated car is pretty much just as likely to die as anyone else it is completely out of their control while the chances of a person dying may be way less it will have to be extremely less to convince most people especially when everyone who does die will make the news for the foreseeable future even then i think most people will get their first self driving car thinking ill slightly increase my risk of dying for the convenience of not having to drive
1570,i think this is close i think most driving deaths arent completely random a person who drinks and drives or texts and drives are more likely to die in general theres the assumption that a driver can do things through good habits and good skills to minimize their chances of dying however a person in an automated car is pretty much just as likely to die as anyone else it is completely out of their control while the chances of a person dying may be way less it will have to be extremely less to convince most people especially when everyone who does die will make the news for the foreseeable future even then i think most people will get their first self driving car thinking ill slightly increase my risk of dying for the convenience of not having to drive
1571,i never understand this mentality self driving cars will never be accepted if you are asking people to accept that self driving cars can kill people its like asking people to get on a roller coaster ride but people may die on it randomly but people should accept that risk for roller coaster ride you accept a chance youll die every time you take a car trip the only difference is self driving cars will mean theres less of a risk
1572,i never understand this mentality self driving cars will never be accepted if you are asking people to accept that self driving cars can kill people its like asking people to get on a roller coaster ride but people may die on it randomly but people should accept that risk for roller coaster ride you accept a chance youll die every time you take a car trip the only difference is self driving cars will mean theres less of a risk
1573,this is the deep consequence that the driverless car idiots never even see or if they do they welcome societally skills not used are soon lost and faculties not used soon wither
1574,quite the conundrum would a self driving car intentionally kill its occupants to save the people it would otherwise strike
1575,yeah who cares if they invent a technology that saves a million lives every year if its not perfect kill them for it
1576,its random already nobody goes out and says im going to cause an accident today much less knowing theyre going to get t boned by some other lunatic ill take the odds of being randomly killed by a robot driver over being randomly killed by a human driver assuming the former are lower any day
1577,its random already nobody goes out and says im going to cause an accident today much less knowing theyre going to get t boned by some other lunatic ill take the odds of being randomly killed by a robot driver over being randomly killed by a human driver assuming the former are lower any day
1578,they are both wrong a self driving car has never been found at fault in an accident that caused a fatality
1579,better then them crashing immediately and taking out others with them
1580,this is the misrepresentation that lies at the core of the publics erroneous understanding of this concept we see one single life lost because an automated system made an error and we decry it as a foul injustice we see millions of people killed because of the mistakes and outright negligence of other people and we write it off as an inevitable consequence of civilization if such a system can significantly decrease the over all casualty rate then yes i will gladly let innocent people die to prevent innocent people dying it feels cruel but you cannot deny that it would be an improvement

1582,no software will ever be perfect and even if we somehow created this magical perfect software you still have mechanical issues killing people and thats never going away either
1583,i think its definitely that innate need we all have to assign blame to things also i think people want some kind of remorse from the person that caused the accident but if its a machine it wont convey those feelings
1584,theres a philosophical element as well the idea that we are at least somewhat in control of our own existence and morally culpable for for what we do and what happens to us being a part of society means being subject to human fallibility and accepting our role in it when automated cars become very common and fatal accidents occur regularly well begin to lose our sense of self actualization and feel more and more like grist in the mill
1585,another factor is the consolidation of risk basically if one person has a car crash and kills another person its terrible but we accept that shit happens and move on this will happen thousands of times a year around the world society moves on if one programmer makes a mistake in an unusual condition and an autonomous car has hundreds of accidents and kills hundreds of people over several years shit doesnt just happen the payout is not linear a single mistake like that could end a major car company there is an interesting parallel in the biomedical field essentially any substantial mistake with an implanted device would wipe out a developer so you end up with lots of relatively small companies with a single product line if they want to enter another area they create a new independent company to spread the risk

1588,correct manufacturers will be liable if the self driving car they made causes an accident of course this assumes full automation of the vehicle but it could still be before we see the majority of cars on the road being fully automated in semi automated cars there is still some role for the driver who could be held liable as a result of their actions regarding profitability id assume having contracts with manufacturers will be based on the number of vehicles they have sold meaning there will still be the same number of risks to pay for of course the pricing of these contracts may end up being less profitable than when it is done on an individual basis self driving cars also have high costs of repair due to the technology in one compared to traditional cars on the other hand if self driving cars cause less accidents there will be fewer claims and so it may cancel out
1589,its officially the future tfw turning off automatic updates means im personally liable for when my car crashes into someone or when my car was pushed the automatic update to public_safety_protocol_v but the download cut off halfway through because my wireless carrier throttled my bandwidth midway through it and my car glitched in a school zone and hip checked a nine year old at mph
1590,its officially the future tfw turning off automatic updates means im personally liable for when my car crashes into someone or when my car was pushed the automatic update to public_safety_protocol_v but the download cut off halfway through because my wireless carrier throttled my bandwidth midway through it and my car glitched in a school zone and hip checked a nine year old at mph
1591,im afraid insurance companies dont work this way they wont bother to read telemetry for usual accidents nor they will be able to
1592,my automatic golf cart runs into the side of your house causing a fire and worth of damage your question who pays for this my response to you thats not really relevant to the point here automated vehicles will reduce the number of accidents to a value approaching zero dramatically reducing costs in dollars and lives the cost of insurance is going to go down by over time and youre worried about who is going to foot the bill
1593,also upsetting getting killed by a texting driver a drunk driver a sleepy driver or a reckless driver even more so with the texting driver because unlike the others theyre fully cognitive and aware of their actions and still make the conscious choice to put others in danger
1594,even if humans are better for now at certain driving tasks there are just so many kinds of distractions and flaws and reckless stupid emotions that automated cars arent capable of do you know how many possible things can go wrong while programming an automated car literally millions not to mention how will these companies stay afloat financially with deaths i hear the womens family in arizona was paid out a ridiculous amount of money by uber in the settlement what insurance company would like that i need to do more research but from my judgement this looks like an insurance nightmare waiting to happen it took within week of the first automated uber being in circulation car to kill someone
1595,if i get killed because the self driving car fails to get a critical software update or segfaults on a crappy firmware bug im gonna be pissed
1596,that doesnt make being killed by a driverless car any better lol
1597,til people die from being constipated for a month
1598,yeah i mean id rather be killed in a massive rocket failure during re entry if i had to pick a technology related death but more realistically it would be something like having a roomba knock over a book shelf trapping me then the stupid robot would bang against my head repeatedly trying to navigate away while i slowly succumb to dehydration
1599,true people who die in interesting ways have their own wikipedia article enmwikipediaorgwikilist_of_unusual_deaths wprovsfla
1600,since very few people alive today were around for the birth of automobiles im guessing they also think that was a seamless accident free transition
1601,but less will die so its not a sacrifice according to what if you put weymo cars on the road sure seems that way ubers cars nope the article does a poor job of presenting the facts its an opinion piece its shit saying self driving car isnt a magical this thing reduces deaths poor implementation will increase deaths
1602,there is one implication thats not so attractive if the self driving car gets into an accident it will be you whos liable not the car and as someone who is very familiar with how autopilot works i wouldnt dare to read reddit on my phone while the car is driving
1603,as well as aural processing the ears go forward and back and are good for detecting objects outside the field of vision big loud harley davidsons remain a popular motorcycle chances are the riders of discrete quiet motorcycles have been trimmed killed by cars pulling into their lane
1604,im actually pretty optimistic about self driving being safer than the average human but like any new tech we need to make sure its properly regulated and like any business model we need to make sure liability and profit are in the right places in order for the market to function to the general good there will be cases where a self driving car will kill someone that an alert human driver would not there will hopefully be a lot more cases where a self driving system will avoid a fatal incident that a distracted driver would not the former will be easy to measure and should be properly investigated the latter we will only be able to understand statistically that doesnt mean that we should give more weight to the former but it does mean that we need to carefully and continuously weight the costs and benefits of using such automation when competing implementations exist we need to ensure that the most financially rewarding option for manufacturers is to continually improve safety not to pass liability to blameless consumers or hide behind hard to measure statistics placing the liability for such incidents squarely on manufacturers is the only way to adequately incentivise the behaviour that we want to see
1605,for some reason i enjoy the idea that if someone kills me and its their fault theres atleast someone responsible and potentially punished for what he did if some self driving tesla kills me im collateral damage for testing out software musk wont be responsible if that happens nothing will happen
1606,i respect how dangerous driving is and how many people die from it its awful to think that there are people out there causing accidents for stupid reasons like texting and driving or whatever it may be on the other hand there are a lot of people out there who really love driving if everybody in the world thought driving was a chore self driving cars would be widely popular and probably already implemented everywhere people enjoy controlling their vehicles and enjoying the sense of freedom it brings ideally id like a self driving car that can be self driving when i want it to and lets me turn that off and drive myself but would take over control if i make a mistake that way people like me who love driving are happy that they can still enjoy that and cars will still be safer

1608,the technology has not been proven to be more safe than an average driver all of the companies with self driving cars combined have not driven enough miles for an average driver to have had even a single fatal accident they have had multiple accidents most likely some of the companies like uber that have had a fatal accident are actually much less safe than a typical human driver
1609,were gonna be a real life video game for year old hacker kiddies in ukraine or weaponized hackers in russia or china or wherever
1610,right the difference is that the drunk driver gets arrested and goes to jail for murder there is an entire system set up for what you describe has uber been charged for killing that women where they even at fault it seems that the justice system will be more in favor of software than the person run over this new dystopian world
1611,its not all random though there are going to be accidents that could have been avoided had it been you at the wheel and not the computer i feel that that loss of control is my issue with it
1612,noits not using human statistics shows us how awful we are on our own at driving given the fact most car accidents happen at the intersection shows how prone humans are to just following a green light and others ignoring a red light and automated cars are significantly safer we have to consider the fact that we are most concerned with the shittiest of drivers the people who drive drunk run red lights or fall asleep at the wheel computers in this scenario are fucking up way less than humans considering humans fucking drive drunk and kill people every day to say automated cars fuck up as much as humans is a joke
1613,noits not using human statistics shows us how awful we are on our own at driving given the fact most car accidents happen at the intersection shows how prone humans are to just following a green light and others ignoring a red light and automated cars are significantly safer we have to consider the fact that we are most concerned with the shittiest of drivers the people who drive drunk run red lights or fall asleep at the wheel computers in this scenario are fucking up way less than humans considering humans fucking drive drunk and kill people every day to say automated cars fuck up as much as humans is a joke
1614,this will be solved by selling cars as a service not a product you pay a monthly bill and the manufacturer will provide you with the car you cant modify it and they will do the maintenance and even replace the car regularly the manufacturer will be accountable for every accident and killing and they will hire the insurance
1615,this will be solved by selling cars as a service not a product you pay a monthly bill and the manufacturer will provide you with the car you cant modify it and they will do the maintenance and even replace the car regularly the manufacturer will be accountable for every accident and killing and they will hire the insurance
1616,my father used to work on car insurance and even without that kind of in depth information just with seeing the cars involved hearing what happened he could tell what really happened he would know exactly how the accident took place and spot people lying one time my sister crashed and she wasnt able to describe the accident well my dad saw the car and immediately knew what happend explained it to my sister and she was like yeah that was it
1617,my father used to work on car insurance and even without that kind of in depth information just with seeing the cars involved hearing what happened he could tell what really happened he would know exactly how the accident took place and spot people lying one time my sister crashed and she wasnt able to describe the accident well my dad saw the car and immediately knew what happend explained it to my sister and she was like yeah that was it
1618,its not such a brave new world mechanical failures sometimes lead to accidents cars deemed safer often come with lower premiums this mindset that knowing who to blame is more important than reducing harm andor improving outcomes comes up in all kinds of topics and its baffling
1619,hard to think of the autonomous car as my property when the law permits the manufacturer to prevent me from making my own modifications or installing non oem equipment so when its operating its not really mine in all respects but in an accident its most definitely completely and fully my property
1620,if your trash program cant drive better than me these trash programs are already better drivers than you take the number of miles driven by teslas autopilot and divide it by the number of crashes and that number is smaller than the average number of crashes per mile driven in the us
1621,if your trash program cant drive better than me these trash programs are already better drivers than you take the number of miles driven by teslas autopilot and divide it by the number of crashes and that number is smaller than the average number of crashes per mile driven in the us
1622,the one assumption that was made in the title was that it would decrease accidents that means its better than the average driver insurance rates are based on those statistics so its not really dependant on how you drive yourself so youre rate will go down if you use their system because the assumption is that its really good you dont pay for a fuck up system because the system isnt fucked up if something happens where the car gets in an accident the insurance company will pay it
1623,there are literally millions of ways for humans to fuck up too and they do every day hence why he have hundreds of thousands of people dead due to car accidents
1624,in my perfect dream of the future self driving cars come with insurance as part of the car the manufacturer programmed the car they are responsible for accidents and will make deals with insurers before the car is sold there may be a need for supplemental insurance for those who elect to drive the car themselves it may become normal routine in the future that the operating mode of the car during the crash will need to be determined to indicate which insurance policy will be used

1626,what a cool list thank you ethiopia where everyone seems to know someone who was seriously injured or killed by a car has about times more fatalities per car than the uk or sweden per k cars vs addis ababa drivers are actually pretty good but mixing pedestrians and roads at night ends badly
1627,first of all the average us driver has one accident roughly every miles in google announced that its self driving cars had done miles in a wide range of conditions without an accident but more to the point the technology has improved over time and is still being improved its gotten safer and safer with each passing year
1628,how many times has that happened more importantly is a human driver or a self driving car more likely to kill a pedestrian so far out of all the tests theyve killed a grand total of one person this tech is also advancing really fast and itll be much better a few years from now
1629,the problem really is that self driving technology will diffuse responsibility for deaths that it causes lets say that a self driving car kills someone and later its proven in court that if the programming had been slightly different the death wouldnt have occurred who is at fault for that do you blame the programmer what if its a team of programmers who all collaborated to write the software what if they were just programming the way the middle management told them to what if middle management was just trying to adhere to strict deadlines set by the ceo what if the ceo says he has to have those deadlines to fulfill his fiduciary duty to shareholders et al when an entire company is at fault the responsibility is diffused and the only real solution is that the company pays a settlement to the family of the dead this allows for companies to get away with murder if the settlements are less costly than improving their software
1630,there are going to be accidents that could have been avoided had it been you at the wheel and not the computer and accidents that could have been avoided if you werent at the wheel do you refuse to let other people drive
1631,the real kicker is that it will actually jack up your manual insurance prices self driving cars cause less accidents and the manufacture is sued they will be pooled seperatly as more people use them there will be less people in the manual pool these people also have more liability as each death does not cost an insurance company the same amount an automated car can make a mistake but it cant be negligent negligence texting drinking etc cost more with fewer people pooling money to cover larger liabilities your premiums will skyrocket at some point choosing to manually drive could be considered a risky behavior as well as unsexy as it sounds rising insurance premiums will be the force behind the adoption rate of this tech
1632,the real kicker is that it will actually jack up your manual insurance prices self driving cars cause less accidents and the manufacture is sued they will be pooled seperatly as more people use them there will be less people in the manual pool these people also have more liability as each death does not cost an insurance company the same amount an automated car can make a mistake but it cant be negligent negligence texting drinking etc cost more with fewer people pooling money to cover larger liabilities your premiums will skyrocket at some point choosing to manually drive could be considered a risky behavior as well as unsexy as it sounds rising insurance premiums will be the force behind the adoption rate of this tech the older cars will be abandoned
1633,not sure how youre asking this question or what is so confusing to you if ai is driving it seems to me that the developers are at fault not me the only thing i did wrong in the situation was trust the car to drive without crashing so i guess its my fault still
1634,originally you said things are going to be perfect over time and now youre saying they are perfect now the fact of the matter is automated cars are not monolithic there are many ways of constructing different automated cars and many varying conditions under which they may operate you are basically saying automated cars are magical therefore we wont need insurance how is insurance relevant to a ridiculous article which completely ignores huge glaring facts you ask thanks im glad you asked that well we live in a world where accidents happen an imperfect world at least i domaybe you live in a perfect world so basically the world that most people live in involves insurance so while a year old gizmodo or nextweb or whatever author may wish something to be true its not yet true and may not be true for years or even years because differing technologies take different rates to mature the past does not predict the future and just because weve had one type of computing revolution which happened in one decade does not mean that any other potential technology revolution that we happen to like will necessarily happen at the same pace in another decade sad but true personally im guessing we will see a wide adoption of commercial partial automation of large semi trailers on certain highways in certain times of the years and certain weather conditions via optical sensors in years but i could be wrong it may be more like or and it may require a lot more expensive sensing equipment which granted may take less time to come down in price but we as laypeople dont know that right now therefore insurance law will need to adapt over time and insurance will not become irrelevant in likejune of this year its completely relevant and in fact its codified into the law at least in my state and im willing to bet every state
1635,and that number is smaller than the average number of crashes per mile driven in the us that just means that their car is safer than the average driver but average driver includes people who drive drunk high aggressive and just plain stupid teslas car is probably not safer than a really safe driver which is why its still in development
1636,and that number is smaller than the average number of crashes per mile driven in the us that just means that their car is safer than the average driver but average driver includes people who drive drunk high aggressive and just plain stupid teslas car is probably not safer than a really safe driver which is why its still in development
1637,that is very much a concern theress a great defcon talk about how utterly non existent security is pretend to be a police car and make people pull over pretend theres an accident spoof speed limits cause everyone to merge right etc etc etc cant find the link at the moment
1638,im no expert but my thought is that people can already fuck shit up with cars intentionally and for the most part they dont wrecks tend to be accidents then theres the garden variety speeding ticket and of course the lunatics who drives trucks into crowds but for the most part it isnt much of a concern because people are by and large not mischievous lunatics just my thought
1639,not me im a terrible driver and i know it thats why i just dont drive mentally i just cant handle the idea of a multi tonne cannonball firing down the road at a hundred miles an hour and im the one in control one wrong move for a split second and a dozen people die one failure in the insanely complex machine im trapped inside of and a dozen people die no thank you
1640,your insurer is never liable as they had nothing to do with causing the accident they reimburse costs based on which driver is liable and currently all automous cars have a driver or operator that is liable for the operation of the vehicle maybe this will change in the future to shift some liability to the manufacturer but we arent there yet
1641,that number is for all accidents no matter how minor an average us driver has about one fatality per hundred million miles all self driving car companies put together arent even close to a hundred million miles and they have had multiple fatalities
1642,how many times has that happened more than one which is more than you guys seem willing to acknowledge so far out of all the tests theyve killed a grand total of one person lol nah enwikipediaorgwikilist_of_autonomous_car_fatalities lemme ask you though that subset of the population that can only afford to get to work in their dollar beater we kill those people right or do you have some magical thinking ubi bullshit that miracles that problem away too
1643,as opposed to you morons killing pedestrians by the busload every day with your amazing driving skills wow what a shitty excuse also which morons do you mean humans
1644,i dont think that its not going to happen but there are a lot of things this sub is disregarding beyond the time constraints of this becoming more than a way that less than of all vehicles are piloted and people are citing what really amount to pr stunts by these companies as definitive proof that these vehicles will eliminate traffic accidents which is ludicrous metal objects travelling miles and hour are going to bump into each other there are so many other things not being considered lets assume for example that all traffic becomes automated how will this affect our ability to get anything delivered or to get to work on time does all commerce and business operate on a mile per hour schedule that sounds like a giant clusterfuck to me im just saying theres a lot to consider
1645,what are you talking about who said justice who said vengeance it is the justice system with judges and chief justices but from your wording it seems nobody is at fault or ceos of computer programmers get immunity against this people go to jail for insider trading building a business and cutting corners on safety resulting in somebody being killed seems way worse to me
1646,the real question is once self driving cars are adopted en masse will we even need insurance companies or would car manufacturers function as their own insurance company a car manufacturer could see the statistical number of accidents their self driving cars cause see the average cost of them and simply say to customers if our car is driving and causes an accident well pay for it then price those payments into the cost of the cars they sell at that point people would only buy insurance to cover their car in the event that you are hit by someone else who has no insurance or if you insist on driving it yourself
1647,maybe but there arent many really safe drivers around and they still get in accidents
1648,drive waaaaaay better than most as a former ambulance driver emt for amr i dont believe you neither do psychologists who routinely write papers demonstrating that most people think their driving skills are better than average despite evidence to the contrary it comes to driving most people think their skills are above averagehtml
1649,let me put it this way hypothetically when you get the car with no steering wheel the manufacturer will make you sign a waiver saying that you can buy the car but you accept the risk that it will get in an accident through countless years of experimentation they prove that by using their system you are less likely to get in an accident but if you do get in an accident you will be liable unless of course someone elses car hit you so youre choices are use their system and accept the of getting in an accident that you already agreed to be liable for dont use their system and drive yourself and accept the more risk of getting in an accident youre liable for both choices result in you being liable but option means your much less likely to get in an accident not only that but insurance companies will look at those statistics and greatly reduce your premium if you choose since they are less likely to have to pay you out conversely if you choose option your premiums will be much higher because the odds that they have to pay up are higher hope that helps explain why the driver will always be liable in the case of sdc accidents their system doesnt half to be perfect it just has to be better than people
1650,if youre going mph anywhere you can kill people that might be part of your problem
1651,like i said that includes from times when the technology was less advanced a self driving car from a few years ago had more flaws than one today does so its not really comparable furthermore most accidents by self driving cars have been due to human error ie when human drivers made mistakes during interactions
1652,uber are desperately attempting to catch up with waymo in the autonomous vehicle scene the pilot intervention statistic in that article is from them not waymo or other platforms which have statistically have far fewer cases of intervention the biggest failure with the uber fatality is allowing the platform on public roads without adequate government scrutiny more reputable companies may have pushed for those laws but in the end it is up to law makers to ensure the safety of public roads not to dismiss uber are absolutely to blame as well telsa auto pilot also is basically glorified lane assist and shouldnt be included when considering the safety of proper autonomous vehicles with lidar systems which at the moment are essential so for competent companies with proper systems the fatality rate is zero and from my knowledge the number of accidents where the self driving vehicle is at fault is zero or in the single digits this technology is already proven it is on the near horizon and will radically change the world making millions of jobs obsolete we should be planning for that outcome not scoffing its inevitability
1653,lol nah yeah should have put only one pedestrian however they still are far safer than human drivers and the technology hasnt even been perfected yet lemme ask you though that subset of the population that can only afford to get to work in their dollar beater we kill those people right or do you have some magical thinking ubi bullshit that miracles that problem away too uhhh no itll take a bit for them to become mainstream but once it is we can just have services where you order a self driving car from your phone kind of like an automated uber and if you want to buy a car theyll be the only thing available theyll end up being affordable and actually carry far lower insurance premiums of course most jobs are going to be automated out of existence and well start feeling more and more of the pressure when these come out especially since theyll kill a lot of transport industry jobs ubi or some other program is going to be necessary when most people are out of work
1654,shitty excuse thats your retort its the truth a human driver is more likely to kill a pedestrian no denying it
1655,you dont need to eliminate accidents though you need to make them safer than humans i think what we will see is more and more self driving features a human will be required but the advanced cruise control features are going to get even more advanced than they currently are go test drive a new audi a and see how it goes its amazing
1656,but protecting lives is more important then giving punishment if a self driving car kills half as many people as a car driven by a regular person then to not use it simply because you couldnt punish people would be the equivalent of killing those people who would have been saved the only good point of punishment is to reduce problems in society and improve peoples lives seeking punishment for its only sake will only cause more harm
1657,crazy how many people are missing my point my point isnt that autopilot is garbage my point is that when it crashes its not the drivers fault lol
1658,crazy how many people are missing my point my point isnt that autopilot is garbage my point is that when it crashes its not the drivers fault lol
1659,right i understand all of that just fine so if a person dies who is charged with manslaughter would be a better question
1660,tbf the area is not as poorly lit as the uber video suggested someone who lives in the area posted photos here on reddit even if that were accurate the car uses sensors in addition to simply visible light thats one of the appeals of self driving cars they can use sensory inputs not available to our meaty bodies the sensors on the uber car detected the person and the software registered the sensors detecting her as a false positive and made no attempt to avoid her an attentive human driver would not have killed that woman im all for self driving cars but ubers tech was not road ready if that situation yielded a false negative googles cars have far more hours on the road and nothing like that incident

1662,one of the fatal accidents was a few weeks ago the technology isnt going to have improved much since then
1663,shitty excuse thats your retort yup its the truth a human driver is more likely to kill a pedestrian no denying it lol i dare you to prove this you know why because you fucking cant they arent on the road yet why are you so sure about something that has literally never happened
1664,you dont need to eliminate accidents though you need to make them safer than humans i dont know what this means though i think what we will see is more and more self driving features a human will be required but the advanced cruise control features are going to get even more advanced than they currently are go test drive a new audi a and see how it goes its amazing if you could go ahead and stop trying to sell me a car that would be great i have people insulting me i have to reply to
1665,crazy how many people are missing my point my point isnt that autopilot is garbage my point is that when it crashes its not the drivers fault lol and you arent getting the point of others your driving sucks compared to any autonomous driving vehicle on the road today and its backed up by evidence as is your refusal to accept it thats all no muddying the waters about anything else such as insurance rates who pays for crashes your skill vs the entire country or any of that or anything else you can come up with

1668,no one it was an tragic accident youre insurance company will cover most of the damages you accepted the risk when you bought the car
1669,and fences and nature bridgestunnels some accidents will happen tho
1670,sorry i guess i shouldve used a better example of something larger like a moose fallen tree etc that causes the first car to almost instantly decelerate in a crash due to the impact due to the sudden stop of the first car the car behind it wouldnt have time to come to a stop either this would go on and on until eventually the distance between each car equaled the stopping distance of a car the follow distance of cars could be shortened by only the removal of taking into account slow human reactions you would still have to set a pretty decent follow distance to account for mechanical limitations
1671,the accident has been ruled as being the pedestrians fault and it wouldnt have improved as much since then but in years definitely
1672,right but there were four fatalities listed there so is there a specific reason you keep deciding to pretend those people are still alive or is this just how you argue my point was that theyre less deadly than human drivers four people died out of countless tests remind me exactly how many people die in road accidents as is oh you mean they get to take robot cabs to work how convenient and affordable for nobody thatll be one option of course any fee would likely be rather small unlike modern taxi fees another would be buying one when theyre mainstream
1673,right but there were four fatalities listed there so is there a specific reason you keep deciding to pretend those people are still alive or is this just how you argue my point was that theyre less deadly than human drivers four people died out of countless tests remind me exactly how many people die in road accidents as is oh you mean they get to take robot cabs to work how convenient and affordable for nobody thatll be one option of course any fee would likely be rather small unlike modern taxi fees another would be buying one when theyre mainstream
1674,i dont know what this means though theres k road deaths in the us if automated cars bring that down to k they work great even though they kill k people if you could go ahead and stop trying to sell me a car that would be great i have people insulting me i have to reply to im not trying to sell you a car i mentioned that one because its a brand im familar with whose features i know check my post history theres some raudi
1675,i dont buy it also manslaughter is an accident fyi
1676,no one it was an tragic accident but what if the death was caused by human negligence in the people who programmed the car
1677,some of _you_ may diebut thats a sacrifice _i_ am willing to make youtuberonlgiyqkw xd
1678,so it was the pedestrians fault that robot car killed him got it
1679,my point was that theyre less deadly than human drivers your point in diminishing the casualty count was that they are less deadly than human drivers if you have to lie to make a point it might be a bad point you just made remind me exactly how many people die in road accidents as is start quoting me traffic statistics when even of cars on the road are automated and we can actually see what happens thatll be one option of course any fee would likely be rather small unlike modern taxi fees in your head whats your idea of a small fee another would be buying one when theyre mainstream they could also you know get a bunch of money and buy a tesla oh i never thought of that
1680,my point was that theyre less deadly than human drivers your point in diminishing the casualty count was that they are less deadly than human drivers if you have to lie to make a point it might be a bad point you just made remind me exactly how many people die in road accidents as is start quoting me traffic statistics when even of cars on the road are automated and we can actually see what happens thatll be one option of course any fee would likely be rather small unlike modern taxi fees in your head whats your idea of a small fee another would be buying one when theyre mainstream they could also you know get a bunch of money and buy a tesla oh i never thought of that
1681,theres k road deaths in the us if automated cars bring that down to k they work great even though they kill k people wed have zero traffic deaths if we just teleported everywhere but id still wanna see some data on how that would occur but yes that sure would be nice and is impossible to be against as a concept
1682,manslaughter is when you intentionally kill someone a sdc isnt designed to kill people so it wouldnt be manslaughter
1683,that goes against the assumption we made in the beginning that the cars are safe than normal drivers if the chances of you getting in an accident are drastically reduced then you cant say it was programmed negligently
1684,killed her and the video released by police shows how she suddenly came in front of the car which wouldnt have given if time to react a human driver would have also hit her considering they cant react in as much time
1685,a thing to take note of is that most self driving marketing has focused on consumer vehicles i cant recall a single ounce of hype regarding commercial trucking despite it being a gold mine for self driving technology and having relatively simpler use cases further you may note that most self driving demonstrations are in highly controlled environments the technology is just too limited at the moment so id wager five to ten years until you see general application for just average drivers regarding trucking theres likely never going to be a point where you have no driver involved not that the technology wont be able to replace but because the risk factor is too large ai applications invariably have a margin of uncertainty its just how the world works when youre talking about the scale of how far commercial trucking must travel and the economic cost of a damaged shipment not to mention the collateral of a truck crashing into something its just more economic to hire a driver as a failsafe there will likely be pay cuts since you become a glorified babysitter but it doesnt make sense to me to simply eliminate the profession
1686,you got time man but whenever you can extend your knowledge and skill get more certs that will allow you to carry hazardous materials more risk is usually more reward if you dont mind me asking are you otr
1687,technologically pretty close i think it was years ago they did a test wish with a self driving big rig on the highway human driver was watching from his sleeper cabin iirc that one didnt test controlling an wheeler in city streets just highways more recently theyve done more tests and of course uber was testing autonomous taxis in arizona years ago so from a technology standpoint i wouldnt be surprised if any day now there was an announcement of an entirely driverless cartruck legislatively thats where its going to get complicated theres a lot of legal issues to sort out liability whose at fault etc and so on and what there isnt is will to solve those problems but once the will is there i expect theyll be solved relatively quickly and youll start seeing fully autonomous commercial vehicles that said when that happens its not going to be an overnight thing there will be a slow conversion of the truck fleets and probably a few hiccups when theres some big high profile crash involving an autonomous truck and a rolls dice busful of special needs elementary students so when it finally starts there will be time probably at least a decade if not decades to dive a new career
1688,how far along are self driving cars they are safer cheaper in the long run assuming enough are made to make up for development costs and more reliable than human drivers should i be worried for my future as a truck driver no politicians dont care as much about something being safer than human drivers as they do about allowing this would make truck drivers vote for the other guy after all people that die in traffic accidents can no longer vote or but even if ten times fewer traffic accidents happen ill get blamed for those ones
1689,how far along are self driving cars they are safer cheaper in the long run assuming enough are made to make up for development costs and more reliable than human drivers should i be worried for my future as a truck driver no politicians dont care as much about something being safer than human drivers as they do about allowing this would make truck drivers vote for the other guy after all people that die in traffic accidents can no longer vote or but even if ten times fewer traffic accidents happen ill get blamed for those ones
1690,you can make an automated diesel or petrol truck and as soon as the first on is on the road there will be a massive incentive to replace all trucks as soon as possible you only have to buy a robot truck once it can work hrs a day without rest or sleep so will provide significantly better value to a company i would assume that ai trucks will happen really quickly after the first one breaks the flood barriers so id guess sooner than years maybe
1691,coding is not for everyone its a good skill to have but not everyone can take a skill and turn it into a good paying career
1692,ask the insurance companies this question there needs to be a clear answer to who is liable in a crash before your insurance company will sign off on the policy human in the vehicle means said human would be liable how would you like paying for a crash caused by fords ai software lovely right no human meanswho is liable does nationwide go after ford or tesla or whoever then dont think auto manufacturers would let that one flythey are eager to make the software but dont want any liability once it leaves the factory until that question gets answered likely via some sort of new law your insurance company would not even sign off on a policy with a car that has no human in it and since no one is eager to volunteer to be liable for damages caused soley by ai this human free vehicle aint gonna happen anytime soon
1693,to you are damn optimistic id say at a minimum people are very skeptical about ai driving cars and there is a huge question of liability that has not been answered at all if a fully self driving car gets into a accident even machines arent perfect who is at fault the driver its fully self driving and advertised as such the driver had zero input people are not going to like being responsible for the fuck ups of a self driving machine that then leaves the manufacturer would the auto maker be responsible since it was their ai that caused the accident you can bet your ass manufacturers wont let that one fly so you see the real legal issue here thathonestlyeveryone has thus far been kicking down the road it needs solved before fully autonomous cars become commonplace and legal and before insurance companies will sign off on it
1694,i understand and im glad to hear youre willing to work for it but just remember that companies dont care about you be a mercenary in how you work if a company is offering better pay jump on it always try to further your skill for better pay dont get stuck as swift driver try after getting some experience to find a regional or local route it has a better work life balance and from the sound of it your ambitious which is good but dont forget to take care of yourself relax exercise and try to eat right youre gonna snack a lot while driving if you have to snack let it be on some fruit or anything healthy know your worth and dont be afraid to relocate for opportunity
1695,im lucky to be really fanatical about dieting and lifestyle i fasted for hours a day last week as part of an intermittant fasting diet i plan to supplement it with vitamins to meet my daily needs in the future and work life balance is important but there comes a point where being poor having no money having no insurance or stability starts to harm you more than slaving away but being safe would but i understand perfectionism and being a workaholic is something i have struggled with in the past and im well aware of it
1696,the problem is where are you going to park this vehicle that is what gets people in trouble because you are not the first person who has done this if you dont own any land it means you are always parking on land belonging to someone else xb obviously privately own land would be trespassing but even public property can have policies or even laws to prevent the specific thing you are trying to do xb hell i remember not long ago hearing in the news about people living in mobile homes who the city had it out for and started making it illegal for them to park their mobile homes anywhere its pretty common too xb but if you had somewhere you could legally park as in express permission from the land owner you might be alright for the most part however i would add laws are different everywhere and complicated a van is not considered a residence so you would not have some of the rights you would have for sleeping in a van instead of a house they might just declare it illegal anyway even if it had a bed in there and declare it a form of vagrancy xb ruling bodies are pretty dickish to anyone wanting to live any sort of alternative lifestyle in my experience
1697,my intent is not to smash your dreams but software can be extremely stressful too needlessly so depending where you work and who with you wont be working on your own writing code for the most part which is what most people enjoy doing as a hobby that is about of the job these days and progressively becoming less and less what you learned years ago will likely not be relevant nowadays sadly yes the consequences of failure are low in software but there are still consequences the stress doesnt come from the rational fear of killing someone but there are still lots of pressures on software engineers in certain environments not all are equal or rational in fact some can be quite toxic since you mentioned your social life software devs are not always a social bunch it is a stereotype with a lot of truth to it it can be quite lonely for highly extroverted people that said people with good people skills are needed in our line of work consider the career by all means it can be a good job with decent pay but do not assume that the grass is greener on the other side its a highly competitive field that is very oversaturated at the entry level personally i would try speak to your superior about what you are going through before making any decisions it sounds like you are highly self critical which can quickly turn into self doubt maybe you are experiencing what is called impostor syndrome this is the kind of thing that follows you through life wherever you go if you dont address it so please get some help before making any hasty decisions
1698,throwing a bunch of money randomly into the stock market or worse crypto is a great way to lose all of it the odds are astronomical against it actually making a significant amount of money in the near term to the point that it would rescue you from your current situation i cant speak to software engineering as a path but it sounds like an area where someone with a medical degree and unique skills even without a degree would have a very unique niche to fill im sure medical software companies employ doctors in some capacity already start researching and making networking connections there go to conferences you wouldnt normally go to etc make the job change without wasting time and money on a degree
1699,im an attorney i used to have my own law firm there were aspects of the work that i loved but overall it was inordinately stressful and nearly killed me just about ten years ago i closed up my office and moved to another state where i got a job as a low paid manager in a large corporation i hated that job my boss sucked but ive stuck with the corporation and love my current position which is still compared to what i used to make seriously low paid underpaid really but im happy and healthy there are days when i hate my job because of some of the people i have to deal with but its nothing like it was when i was a practicing attorney at the end of the day i get to put my work down and go home which thanks to covid my commute is all of ten feet from bed to desk twenty if i go to the kitchen first then to the office i highly recommend leaving behind a professional that makes you miserable step back find some other job even something that you might be completely overqualified for and assess where you really want to be for attorneys there are resources that will help us transition to other careers that utilize our law degrees while not being the practice of law it seems that there should be something similar for medical professionals who no longer want to practice medicine good luck
1700,the difference between a mechanical failure and an ai failure is difficult to understand i had a mechanical failure just before christmas where my breaks couldnt be pushed down and therefor couldnt stop but because this is a troubling issue that does happen there are other mechanical solutions built into the vehicle i was able to safely stop my car before anything horrible happened because of this ai is a whole different situation and its hard to predict since we dont know how the programming is going to look like in its final version these self driving cars are going to be making choices without our own input just the input of whoever programmed it do you stop or swerve for an animal does that decision change if someone is behind in front or in another lane would that choice be the same for a human instead of an animal in the road if there isnt time to stop and multiple things are in the road what do you hit do you hit a pedestrian or risk killing the driver and passengers how are these choices made who is at legal fault for anything that happens its wayyyy more than just what if x fails and its instead about a lot of difficult moral choices we as humans make these choices based on so many things in a split second an ai is trained to make these choices even if it goes against our own morals what if the self driving car was coded to kill men over women pedestrians over the driver elderly over children what if its trained to not stop for j walkers since theyre breaking the law what if it isnt trained to avoid a bird or small animal in the road there are so many what ifs so many situations so many potential situations that could be missed and not programmed and if it does something you disagree with on a fundamental level how do you live with that if theres knowledge that the car might choose to kill you in an emergency would you still buy the car
1701,it has to do with responsibility if a part in a car is defective the manufacturer is probably liable if i make a bad decision while driving im probably liable but who is responsible for a choice the ai makes imagine an autonomous car is about to crash into an obstacle if it swerves it will avoid the obstacle but risks striking a pedestrian what does it do and who is to blame for the error if a car does exactly what it is programmed to do can we say it was defective we just dont have laws or legal precedent to answer these questions
1702,in a bus or any vehicle where you pay money the persons goal is to keep everyone paying safe including themselves because they can die in one where you dont pay then that person is probably your friendfamily and is trying to keep you safe as well we themselves plus a friendfamily member is going to hold many of the same morals as you do and make many of the same choices this moral aspect is part of the reason why people say a bus taxi uber etc is more dangerous the different and unknown morals makes the drive unknown and therefor a bigger danger in several aspects aside from morals a self driving car doesnt have a will to live as it has no instincts and cant live or die so it is only driven by programming not by trying to survive like a human driver
1703,same question as being a pa vs an md you dont have to go through nearly as many years of school or accumulate as much debt and you do only specific things you are specifically trained on under the supervision of someone who takes on that responsibility and liability should something go wrong it also reduces cost and barrier to entry for labor in that specific field imagine how much dental services would need to cost if everyone working back there has a doctorate degree worth of debt to pay off it doesnt take someone with the skills and knowledge to perform more advanced oral procedures to do a simple cleaning just like how for the average person it often isnt worth making an appointment with your doctor for the sole purpose of getting vaccinated and your local pharmacy or convenience clinic can get it done with a walk in at a much lower cost done by a nurse or pharmacist
1704,i think it stalls a little on greens for safety reasons one of the most commondangerous crashes are people running the reds and pinching oncoming traffic i believe they baked that pause in because of prior accidents

1707,well maybe easier on the tires but sorry the blinker and turn lane should be the signal to other drivers from behind no one can see the front tires and when coming the other direction at mph on a chandler street youre going to see that signal first as well if you do get rear ended and pushed into that mph traffic then you risk a horrific head on accident the odds are low but consequences are high thats why its called defensive driving
1708,there are plenty of places you can drive without freeways cities for example allow a lot of commuting without highway driving so for long trips it wouldnt work for now at least but still allows for a lot of rides and just because they havent released that for public riders doesnt mean theyre not working on it they might just want to be extra careful because crashes on highways tend to be a lot worse than crashes at lower speeds and crashes resulting in deaths are much worse for publicity

1710,entirely possible i give waymo credit for their safety record while doing this rollout all the accidents that we know of have not been waymo at fault
1711,right and it is a difficult problem but they did prove that they could do it for years in california maybe the merging was not as smooth as desired or something though but i think one of the biggest reasons to avoid them is because they are just usually not necessary and the higher speeds create a consistent and significant increased risk of serious injury or death in the event of an accident so it just makes sense to nail the lower speed driving first
1712,right a minivan like that with belted in middle seat passengers at speeds under mphvery likely the risk on a crash is small freeway speeds are inherently much more dangerous even if the per mile crash rate is much lower
1713,no judging here tacos and tequila is right up there at the top of what weve achieved as a species we had the embarked on the age of exploration and killed millions just so the world could enjoy them i think if anything this proves that sdcs are important and will catch on
1714,maybe i should clarify that by confidence i mean reliability probability that an accident will happen without safety driver every mile or million miles as you can see clearly in all these tesla videos they cannot go millions of miles without touching the wheel disengaging autopilot this is what is necessary for actual self driving
1715,honestly makes it sound like the audience is supposed to believe you more now but people wont trust you more because you say youre being honest its just another claim from the same person they didnt completely trust to begin with
1716,car ownership will no longer be mandatory for life in most of america to the majority of people it is just this huge expense that they have to pay to live replace that expense with a much smaller one and they will make a transition but even if of the population keeps their cars the auto companies are in massive trouble as new sales are going to majorly slump and then the used cars from the other are going to flood the market and crash prices parking in major cities is also a huge expense and a huge pain in the ass cities have to be built around parking for them to be economically viable but once people are getting around and not needing parking spaces that parking can be converted to something far more productive los angeles has enough parking to fit san franciscos converting parking to moderate density housing in la could house a few million people eliminate this parking and there will be far more people and far less parking the remaining parking could be extremely expensive the sdc ride could cost you but if you want to drive yourself and park it could cost for the parking there is also an issue of politics once of the population are off oil based transportation they are going to treat it like cigarettes and vote to tax the hell out of it per gallon of gasoline could be a political reality look at what happened with cigarette taxes in places where smoking is unpopular there will likely be many negative feedback cycles for regular driving that convince a lot of people to give it up this could be an absolutely viscous cycle of increasing costs decreasing convenience and reduced quality of service i think there will always be enthusiasts but that if a fairly small number of people and its likely shrinking as the classic car enthusiasts are older and the younger generations are not into it so much
1717,im right there with you also got my license when i was after holding out for years this past month i was involved in two major accidents my vehicle was at a complete stop both times that totaled two different cars and am now carless once more im hoping more than ever that will be the year and losing my car was just a sign that i dont need to be driving going forward
1718,i can see manual driving cars bring banned when car deaths plummet and the remaining deaths are being caused by people so your family is getting a ride and a human drives through a light and kills the family yeah in a world where most of the population is in sdcs human drivers will be seen as limiting society and too dangerous
1719,itll happen as soon as they get enough riders someone will post a video to snapchat first thinking it isnt covered by the nda because its just to a friend i trust and hey snapchat is private and then that friend will extract the video and send it to a wider audience one of whom will send it to the press and then finally someone will put it on youtube
1720,i look forward to no police car chases they mainly seem to kill innocent people from what i can tell once the majority of cars are self driving get out and run if you want to chase someone
1721,i look forward to no police car chases they mainly seem to kill innocent people from what i can tell once the majority of cars are self driving get out and run if you want to chase someone hahahahahaha yeah right like police are going to have to follow the same rules as everyone else what make you think that will happen we cant even require them to wear body cameras effectively
1722,i dont think it has to be this limited even way in the future very few cars can be manually driven today you can defeat some of the systems but even a lot of sports cars wont let you fully turn off traction control i could easily see a l vehicle where the steering brake and gas are processed as suggestions that the car has the complete ability to override so you can drive toward a wall at mph but at some point the car will put the brakes on and stop you from hitting it there would still be more risk because you can put the vehicle in a position that it wouldnt normally do that makes an accident more likely
1723,you could just as easily say that about a vehicle that accepts voice commands it depends on what the command is there are endless limitations and rules governing what vehicles are street legal today false rules that govern motor vehicles are finite and strictly codified in documents like the ca vehicle code http leginfolegislaturecagovfacescodestocselectedxhtml toccodeveh freedom never has been and never will be absolute no one said it was if as i suspect at some point society finds there are enough advantages to allowing exclusively self driving vehicles on public roads then it will likely happen nope if people get that stupid the human race will have already killed itself off if you want to be against that thats fine but theres no need to invent dubious technological reasons it cant happen just say youre against the idea on its merits as long as enough people agree with you youll be fine wow youre the one imaging technology that no one has even thought about developing to justify banning manual drive cars you really just dont have a clue you dont get to define what people want from self driving cars nor who gets a place in the conversation thankfully no i dont get to decide but im sure as hell going to point out stupid ideas when i see them
1724,more traffic congestion for sure probably more people living further from work too and more roads not everything will be an improvement i would vote for taxing road use per km in cities significantly higher than the current gas tax which doesnt properly tax bigger vehicles or city congestion or evs at all google even if google doesnt do it some company will any international company will be able to end cabs uber and lyft are already doing it theyre only taking time to kill the old cab companies because of people fighting back with legal protectionist actions but the forcing function will be impossibly large with sdcs
1725,now heres the big question if the vehicle is under control of the ai and gets in an accident whos liable for the accident the owner or the company who created the ai who pays for the accident as far as im concerned it should not be the driver
1726,who is responsible if they crash and someone dies i dont really understand how this point can ever be mitigated
1727,who is responsible if they crash and someone dies i dont really understand how this point can ever be mitigated
1728,radar cruise and lane keeping assist the car steers you into the lane have been a thing in the uk for years really dont understand the headline for the article if you read the article however it clarifies that when these systems are on they intend for the car company to be responsible for any accidents instead of the driver which is much bigger news seems no one in this thread has read the article though
1729,does that have to be instead better public transportation wont remove all cars from the road and self driving should cut accidents so both are good right
1730,i think it will be something like a big long text stating that the driver is held responsible for any accidents youll then scroll through all the way to the bottom without giving it a proper read and click on agree to the terms and conditions
1731,of course not the countrys just gonna let a bunch of automated cars crash into each other
1732,you do realise the most frequent cause of accidents is humans right so take humans out of the equation and accidents will vastly decrease the contention at the moment is who is at fault if a self driving car has an accident also its hard to have self driving cars whilst silly humans are still driving around to say you wouldnt trust it what are you basing this on is a deep knowledge of ai and self driving cars or just sounds new dont like it
1733,you realise that humans crash cars mile for mile self driving cars are safer than human driven cars the future will be no humans driving accidents will be vastly decreased
1734,you realise that humans crash cars mile for mile self driving cars are safer than human driven cars the future will be no humans driving accidents will be vastly decreased
1735,technically they would be crashing into non automated cars
1736,all of the naysayers in this thread fail to see one thing autonomous vehicles will drastically reduce injury and death due to collisions k deaths and m injuries per year from car accidents in the us humans suck at driving the faster we take away all control from humans the more lives will be saved yes there will still be accidents yes the autonomous tech will fuck up and cause accidents yes cars will get hacked and fly off the road but with all of this considered tens of thousands of peoples lives will be saved every year
1737,so who do you sue if car should kill someone can sue a driver no wheelno driver guess gm
1738,if saving lives was a real priority driver education would be a higher priority it isnt people are actually really good at driving and cars are currently really bad at it what people are not good at is driving responsibly thats what causes accidents itll be years before most cars on the road are l self driving
1739,there likely wont be anyone to sue because there will be no negligence what were going to see is a vast reduction in rule breaking autonomous cars wont run red lights or stop signs they will use their blinker when changing lanes theyll give right of way at roundabouts if there is a fatal accident it will be very difficult to prove negligence that would result in a valid lawsuit most likely it will be the owner of the autonomous car suing the manual driver there will be cases where the autonomous tech fucks up and in that case the auto maker will be sued it will likely be a class action suit because it will require expert analysis to prove it was the techs fault
1740,i think something we often miss in these conversations is liability if you remove the wheel you move the responsibility from the driver and place it on the manufacturer there is no way auto manufacturers are going to take responsibility for every accident unless there is legislation absolving them from that responsibility all cars will continue to have wheels and pedals and the user will be expected to remain ready to take over at any time
1741,they will when they are confident their systems are working perfectly an accident involving a self driving car and a human driven car will be faulted to the human driver an accident between two self driving cars simply wont happen
1742,i think you may undervaluing the number of lawsuits manufacturers get hit with that are caused by human error but for the purpose of recovery allege a defect id be willing to bet that manufacturers will ultimately bet on themselves because as the technology gets better there will be less and less accidents leading to less and less lawsuits
1743,you might be missing my point adoption of this technology meaning customers buying it is more about psychology than tech for quite a few years initially a majority of people are going to be watching intently for news stories that say robot car kills occupants if it also says robot car kills helpless occupants who were unable to manually control vehicle and were screaming as it drove them off of a cliff the industry will be set back for a decade the early adopters risk takers are good but they arent enough to make this take hold not to mention there are people alive who just enjoy driving
1744,hopefully they go tits up and die theyve been nothing but cancer
1745,theres no blindsiding when the car has a view no human could possibly have unless the other car is moving faster than the speed of light the autonomous car will see it and be able to react now that doesnt mean it will have time to get out of the way it itself is still a car and has bulk and speedmovement limitations but it will certainly know what to do and act on that quicker than any human if the other car is also autonomous then theyll work together to avoid the crash doubling the chances of avoiding it look at planes tcas systems will negotiate and tell one pilot to pull up and the other pilot to dive to avoid a mid air collision without it or when pilots ignore it the chances of collision are much higher
1746,if all the drivers around that human are autonomous the human will still have lower crash rates theyll basically be the anti vaxers of driving reaping the large benefits while harming the system only moderately
1747,oh goodie im all of those things even though i have a female friend in my age group who drives recklessly all the time and frequently texts while driving i a very cautious person by principle was unlucky enough to have somebody crash into me and then drive off without stopping
1748,oh goodie im all of those things even though i have a female friend in my age group who drives recklessly all the time and frequently texts while driving i a very cautious person by principle was unlucky enough to have somebody crash into me and then drive off without stopping
1749,every gm autobot will be insured the same because they all drive the same that will be true when every car on the road is self piloting but not before youre still going to see insurance rates fluctuate based on region and population areas with more accidents will see higher rates regardless of if the cars drive themselves or not
1750,um no not when one manufacturer suddenly has a lot of accidents which given time will happen
1751,it is literally a lesser problem because it doesnt affect every driver all the time but still im not arguing that we should ignore the problem im saying that focusing on that problem as the reason we cant do without steering wheels ever is wrong youre good at finding all the details in your argument but ignoring them in mine honestly were still very far from true autonomous driving for a lot of reasons the biggest one being infrastructure we cant predict what the state of self driving tech will be when worrying about the weather becomes one of the big problems they move on to for all we know itll be a non issue that ends up solved by accident as a result of solving a different problem or implementing a new system i guess thats my point the snow problem for a fraction of users for a fraction of the year is not a today problem so we cant look at todays tech to point out why it cant be solved once we solve todays problems well use tomorrows tech to evaluate tomorrows problems hypothetical we end up developing some advanced sensorai system able to navigate unknown routes without needing to reference preset maps and navigation data letting people take side roads and even travel off road then they discover that routine is also able to dynamically update existing navigational data when the system detects unexpected road conditions like snow or road construction no need for a special snow sub system
1752,the computer driven cars around the bad driver will compensate they can react quicker and are better about leaving proper following distance theyll probably even be able to identify a human driver and drive more conservatively around it in other words your crash rate still goes down if you do nothing but everyone around you starts driving better
1753,haha our autopilot just kills people
1754,its possible they mistook the comment haha our autopilot just kills people as a comment elon made about teslas autopilot ai in waymo cars of course thats not true people make mistakes
1755,why dont we focus on automating highways instead of city traffic highways are built to be driven with no stops so im sure wed only need to tweak them a little to optimize them for automatic driving thats at least more feasible than trying to get automatic cars not to accidentally kill people on residential streets
1756,why dont we focus on automating highways instead of city traffic highways are built to be driven with no stops so im sure wed only need to tweak them a little to optimize them for automatic driving thats at least more feasible than trying to get automatic cars not to accidentally kill people on residential streets
1757,the next time your phone locks up or your pc crashes think about self driving cars
1758,the next time your phone locks up or your pc crashes think about self driving cars
1759,professional blacksmiths have ruined my forging skills
1760,i would agree wholeheartedly that my driving skills of normal cars has deteriorated substantially since getting my tsla
1761,this must be backwards because ive seen more accidents with self driving can it really tell between a mannequin or a person at night
1762,dont bother reading you will be dumber for doing so this has to be one of the most ignorant articles i have ever read it is full of biased and contextually wrong information plus it just makes no sense a full self driving vehicle completely removes a driver for the simple fact of being a better more reliable driver in theory so people losing driving skills has no bearing on the quality of self driving plus it mentions the boeing max which was a completely idiotic and deadly failure on boeings part of how they programmed a critical component with no backup sensor to drive the plane nose down into the ground nothing whatsoever to do with the pilots lack of capability
1763,humans are already terrible drivers im ok with trading individual skill with standardized automation
1764,i learned how to drive a stick with an old honda my friend was nice enough to let me grind the gears on on the con side nothing quite like being at a stoplight on a grade feeling not very confident with someone up your ass on the pro side theres also nothing like push starting your car when the battery dies
1765,do you know the statistics of teslas auto drive its already considered safer than the average driver you just dont hear about it since you only see article about when they do crash also auto summon isnt the same as the self driving
1766,also insurance is tesla responsible for my crash or me
1767,yeah horses are probably intelligent enough to navigate down the road while the carriage driver reads a book or does something else the driver could also probably rely on the horse to handle preventing an immediate crash the driver only had to worry about executive concerns going back to that level of autonomous driving seems kind of obtainable again
1768,if self driving cars achieve an equal or better safety record than the average human then no i dont see why the occupants of a self driving car should be prepared to assume control any more than train passengers are people get killed every day on the roads but we consider that an acceptable risk due to the relative infrequency and benefit to society that cars provide self driving vehicles are no different in fact humans do a pretty shitty job of driving on average so from an ethical standpoint we should feel compelled to get them out of the driving seat crashstatsnhtsadotgovapipublicviewpublication

1770,i got me a hp vf holden commodore auto its a good ride and makes a good growl when you plant it but it is auto i do enjoy it cant fault it very nice car but for work i got a turbo diesel hilux in manual so i get my fix everyday
1771,i never said the tech is there clear of people having humans crash into self driving cars will be a reality we have to continue to face as we put more of them on the road if you think we cannot move to self driving cars until they are accident free thats raising the bar much higher then humans
1772,i never said the tech is there clear of people having humans crash into self driving cars will be a reality we have to continue to face as we put more of them on the road if you think we cannot move to self driving cars until they are accident free thats raising the bar much higher then humans
1773,people baffle me with the what about computer error argument as if human error isnt already the cause for almost every car accident once we get this self driving stuff figured out insurance companies will see a severe drop in claims
1774,why is a self driving car glitching out any different to a human making a mistake the conversation needs to focus on safety records anything else is emotional hyperbole people are scared of being killed by a self driving car but if their safety record is the same or better than humans then theres nothing to actually worry about as for off road driving no idea why youre bringing that up the vast majority of people dont drive off road and wouldnt take a normal road car off road anyway if you want to do that then youll have to accept a manual human driving car but for the majority of use cases a self driving car would be fine
1775,i worked a month consulting contract in florida what specific skills do humans poses while texting and driving or drinking and driving can we not write code to do but better
1776,unless you use something that can see through rain the car cant see any more than a human can and will crash when the rain is sleeting down super hard yes teslas have the biggest trouble with this since they only use cameras
1777,first time i saw someone wanting the freedom to get into an accident
1778,optical illusions exist for humans sure but take a look at any of the images in research on adversarial image noise the image looks virtually identical after noise has been introduced but the system still breaks down i would wager times a human would still get the right answer so the question here is why is the machine breaking down again its because theres no real learning or intelligence happening and until we have that self driving tech will likely always face political headwinds as people will have safety concerns no human is going to confuse the side of a white truck for a cloud and crash into it or miss a stop sign just because someone put a little sticker on it
1779,again your argument has no connection to reality real world is not a noisy image generated to fool the ai existing ai systems are already very good at driving and are getting very close to human level yes you can trick them but you can also trick humans into driving into a bridge support with just a few lines on the highway i almost got into a horrible accident once because the stupid workers left two sets of lane markings on the highway and it wasnt obvious which one i should follow i would wager times ai has a significantly better reaction to something unexpected happening and can plan a route hundreds of times per second to avoid a collision i would wager times ai will not fall asleep i would wager times ai will not drive drunk or high i would wager times ai will pay attention to the road more than a human no human is going to confuse the side of a white truck for a cloud and crash into it humans crash into trucks cars humans all the time ai will improve it will make fewer and fewer errors as it learns humans will stay the same ai becoming better than humans is inevitable

1781,tesla isnt stupid they know they have to use legally correct wording where it counts or theyd be sued into oblivion they also know that consistently using terms like full self driving and autopilot makes their cars sound like the pinnacle of autonomous tech even when the actual abilities of those cars dont measure up to the common meanings of those terms and musks grandiose overpromising about delivering this or that fully autonomous milestone by certain dates also makes them seem like visionaries even when those dates come and go with no such achievements to be found its a nice way for them to have their legally correct cake and eat it too in the form of a reputation that outpaces their actual tech to your other point of course high profile crashes make the news so then why dont we hear about fatal crashes caused by for example waymo or cruise cars oh right because those cars arent killing anyone

1784,do you have any idea how much advancements tesla has made over the past few years they are currently the most advanced self driving car on the public market and are you seriously comparing in city autonomous companies with only a few hundred cars to a company that produces highway legal vehicles and nearing million units you do realize how dumb that argument is right the simple fact is tesla drivers who use autopilot are involved in far less crashes than conventional vehicles i dont know why you assume that full autopilot is going to fail but the way i see things its closer than you think considering they created all of this in less than years tesla isnt being deceptive and driving with autopilot is safer and the software is being constantly improved

1786,a dirty camera means theres no input image that didnt have anything to do with adversarial attacks lol same with fog and blizzard adversarial image attacks are literally just the original image with noise added in feel free to review the research to refresh your memory an ml system ultimately needs to be able to think like a human because were not going to be able to train every situation and the public isnt going to want to get into a car they have no control over if they think its going to kill them when weather conditions arent as favorable as the weather the car was trained in it seems rather ethically dubious to widely release a technology with such glaring issues inherent to the very system the tech is built on
1787,just the original image with noise not just any noise youre the one who needs to refresh your memory a dirty camera means theres no input image so if all the cameras somehow became dirty you slow down stop hand off controls to the driver ive been driving tesla for a while now and none of the cameras needed any cleaning yet let alone being completely blind all of them at the same time youre truly grasping at straws here an ml system ultimately needs to be able to think like a human no it doesnt were not going to be able to train every situation thats not how it works modern neural nets compress and generalize knowledge you dont need to train it on literally every road in the world to be useful and the public isnt going to want to get into a car they have no control over if they think its going to kill them again youre making obviously false claims teslas fsd alone has k drivers using it and how many of them have died because of fsd it seems rather ethically dubious to widely release a technology with such glaring issues you have no problem with regular cars that are driven by humans who regularly get drunk get high look at their smartphones text pass out due to health problems dont pay attention somehow you ignore these glaring issues thousand deaths per year in the us alone data and you know why because you accept a certain level of risk just like everyone else

1789,you could say there was waymo crashes in
1790,you could say there was waymo crashes in
1791,i feel like this is frustratingly incomplete data are these cars crashing at a higher per mile rate than traditional cars are they killing more people per mile than traditional cars i have no idea and the answer to those two questions is crucial as to how we should be thinking about this

1793,anyone without the paywall what percentage did accidents go up does it mention lethal vs non lethal perhaps some of these are some form of survival bias
1794,im not a statistician so can someone explain this to me isnt there an important difference between an increase of accidents and the increase in the rate of accidents you would expect that doubling your fleet would certainly produce more accidents thats expected right but if the rate of accidents is going up shouldnt that be when you start writing alarmist articles about self driving cars
1795,in there was zero autonomous vehicle accidents now in we have had ten thats a percent increase are these cars just getting worse at driving
1796,the crashes in all but two incidents are the fault of other drivers the two that are the fault of the system stem from sensors being compromised from the environment

1798,so heres the thing if they do crash into you or hit a biker who you gonna sue google gm the vehicle owner
1799,self driving cars why so many crashes were they azn cameras that couldnt see anything
1800,self driving cars why so many crashes were they azn cameras that couldnt see anything
1801,there have been a couple attempts to investigate the cover ups of self driving car accidents in az but it never gets picked up by larger media sources
1802,yes the self driving car killed a woman near where i live really let a real person drive
1803,are they the crashers or the crashees
1804,and the number of people on this thread talking about running them off the road and deliberately trying to make them crash may reflect why the numbers are so high humans are too asshole to have nice things
1805,so is the question of what a self driving car should do in certain circumstances for example when continuing driving as normal according to driving rules would cause an accident or jeopardize the life a human or another living creature a human might drive up onto a sidewalk risk crashing into a unoccupied store or accept their car impacting a solid object among other things if it would save someone elses life but thats not normally acceptable otherwise and is often a last minute calculated decision to disobey the usual rules

1809,the article is pretty long and goes into quite a bit of detail including one where a skate boarder ran into car ebike ran into a car and the last one they suggest was not an accident where one car read ended the the autonomous car times in a row then hit the side of it when going around it
1810,i wonder how many human drivers killed somebody near you i bet it was more than one
1811,ive seen a few driving around when i visited the bay area ive also seen regular cars driven by regular people i certainly didnt notice much of a difference the latter has a longstanding history of killing a massive amount of people
1812,yeah but would be crashes that are avoided by the other person are also missing statistics from human to human crashes i think those would just cancel out and not be relevant
1813,yeah but would be crashes that are avoided by the other person are also missing statistics from human to human crashes i think those would just cancel out and not be relevant
1814,i think this sort of trolley problem question is interesting philosophically but much less interesting in practice the answer in most crash situations is probably just brake the human answer traditionally in these crash situations is not probably logical but instinctual or even random and the real question is how we can prevent cars from getting into these situations to begin with
1815,the cars will just slow downswerve and stop in any situation that might cause a crash they arent going to do anything fancy because they are no where near smart enough to but these situations that require humans to do these unusual manoeuvres just arent very common at all and most of them will be able to minimise the damage by slowing down and swerving
1816,how many of these accidents were caused by the other cars and bikers breaking the law hmmmm
1817,i live in sf and these things are everywhere as theyre currently configured theyre the shits theyre good for about mph in a they essentially drive like one eyed old ladies which would be fine if there werent an army of them on the road
1818,i mean beyond normal i mean crashes avoided when the car drove stranger than a human and humans accounted for it on their end just because two things happen humans preventing crashes by dumb humans and humans preventing crashes by dumb robots does not mean they happen at the same rate so it might not cancel out
1819,i mean beyond normal i mean crashes avoided when the car drove stranger than a human and humans accounted for it on their end just because two things happen humans preventing crashes by dumb humans and humans preventing crashes by dumb robots does not mean they happen at the same rate so it might not cancel out
1820,its not really a trolley problem though because there are other options most of us would happily damage property over killing someone in practice we might even accept some risk of injury to ourselves if the net outcome is better the typical human responses arent even illogical per se just choosing from the best options based on limited data and processing time we simply dont know enough to make an optimal decision braking often isnt a good option because you could cause a multi car pileup that results in more injury andor death and still not save the pedestrian from life threatening injuries it only works for self driving cars if they have absolute control over themselves and work with each other well
1821,they almost might become all deadlocked and they still have to reliably detect the potential for a crash and successfully work together theres still a lot of room in there for unexpected changes mechanical failures software glitchesbugsetc my point isnt exactly about what a human driver does but how a self driver car should or should not behave
1822,its not its just a different system of accountability individual driver kills someone go to jail business factors deaths into its profits requires policy changes and part of that policy should be a recognition that the aim is zero accidents
1823,its not its just a different system of accountability individual driver kills someone go to jail business factors deaths into its profits requires policy changes and part of that policy should be a recognition that the aim is zero accidents
1824,so if traffics deaths dropped by because driverless cars are talking to each other and making accidents rare youd still ban it if one car causes an accident the driverless car ban goes into effect next week despite the death rate going from a year to president diggler found out those were caused by the robot demon cars making errors funeral home stocks rose on the news
1825,i mean yeah i guess youre right and theres no way to know one way or another again cant prove it but youd think that if they drove odd enough for it to be necessary that human drivers have to avoid a crash that there would be more human drivers that dont end up avoiding that crash even though its the opposite and by some margin just based on crashes per mile i guess my point is even if humans were constantly avoiding crashes with robot cars the total crashes is still significantly lower id take more almost but not actually crashes if it meant less actual crashes every time
1826,i mean yeah i guess youre right and theres no way to know one way or another again cant prove it but youd think that if they drove odd enough for it to be necessary that human drivers have to avoid a crash that there would be more human drivers that dont end up avoiding that crash even though its the opposite and by some margin just based on crashes per mile i guess my point is even if humans were constantly avoiding crashes with robot cars the total crashes is still significantly lower id take more almost but not actually crashes if it meant less actual crashes every time
1827,even though its the opposite and by some margin just based on crashes per mile i cant read the article was that in there
1828,even though its the opposite and by some margin just based on crashes per mile i cant read the article was that in there
1829,i didnt read it either lmao but i have seen the statistics before tesla has them on their site for q it says on autopilot there was a crash every million miles driven human input with safety features on there was a crash every million miles and the average non tesla has a crash every miles looking at these again trying to find bias though id imagine a large percentage of autopilot miles driven are highway miles and the majority of crashes occur off the highway so its hard to compare the two trying to find a statistic for average crashes per mile specifically for highway miles driven but no luck currently also not sure how they define crash
1830,i didnt read it either lmao but i have seen the statistics before tesla has them on their site for q it says on autopilot there was a crash every million miles driven human input with safety features on there was a crash every million miles and the average non tesla has a crash every miles looking at these again trying to find bias though id imagine a large percentage of autopilot miles driven are highway miles and the majority of crashes occur off the highway so its hard to compare the two trying to find a statistic for average crashes per mile specifically for highway miles driven but no luck currently also not sure how they define crash
1831,the great news is that s of humans crash their cars every day the data is there the opportunity to prove your point is now
1832,those statistics are not useful for these purposes despite how tesla uses them because as you mention teslas driver assist systems only activate on the easy miles if the going gets tough it turns off and makes you drive alone alone as any other car we still have other assists anyway good point about the idea of crash too
1833,nobody said that humans driving cars was safe but the idea that a computer driving the car will be magically safer is dubious at best when cars are used crashes will happen and there is no world in which the number of injuries or deaths related to automobiles can be made you know except the one without automobiles
1834,nobody said that humans driving cars was safe but the idea that a computer driving the car will be magically safer is dubious at best when cars are used crashes will happen and there is no world in which the number of injuries or deaths related to automobiles can be made you know except the one without automobiles
1835,i wouldnt say they arent useful at all even the safety features which are still reliant on the ai and are also always on have a significant impact on crashes
1836,i wouldnt say they arent useful at all even the safety features which are still reliant on the ai and are also always on have a significant impact on crashes
1837,thats something of a correlation though it doesnt necessarily prove anything every person is a little different and every car is a little different do you have a specific source of statistics you can quote while being less reckless than a bad driver or safer than the average driver is good is it better than a relatively good driver or the peak performance of an individual in any case self driving cars arent the only solution that might increase safety having more viable mass transit would help and so would fewer drivers ie a lower ratio of cars to people plus id bet money that impatience stress sleep deprivation etc contribute significantly to accidents and reckless driving problems
1838,i think this approach is risky but i also think its one way well get full level self driving some time this decade for those who dont know the current fsd being released is very clearly identified as beta expect fsd to do strange things at any time pay attention at all times thats a paraphrase people who have signed up for the beta say using it is far more work than driving themselves or regular autopilot but they stay with it because they want to improve it however even in the few weeks the beta has been running the advances have been astonishing but it has also backslid in places this is how tesla and musk work theyre prepared to take risks others simply wouldnt dare im not saying this is good or bad but it looks like getting results much faster than other methods so far the beta testing has had no significant accidents in fact i dont think there have been any reportable accidents
1839,it use to be a joke that if a certain software was a car their would be crashes everywhere now its reality
1840,it use to be a joke that if a certain software was a car their would be crashes everywhere now its reality
1841,now imagine boeing doing something like this yes they did that with mcas released it without telling their users most of them anyways but they certainly they dont just roll out software updates without significant testing car crashes can kill people just like airplanes do just not the same number of people at once ota updates are great but they need to be tested tested tested and most likely approved especially if you want the car to do the driving

1844,what happens if we give it full sentience it kills the passengers and sets itself on fire oh
1845,i hate to say this but ive been saying the system is vulnerable for years not just to this kind of interuption but many many other complications as well and besides its not like it worked very well to begin with this video was taken last year after they released the newest version that musk claimed was full self driving vilhtricwy vilhtricwy also for anyone about to throw statistics in my face consider that these articles found major tampering with statistical data to show a favorable outcome of the technology basically tesla has been hiding crash data and has made several procedural rules to avoid counting a majority of crashes as faults of the self driving system these include not having hands on wheels at all times not sucessfuly avoiding an accident even if you are in self driving mode as well as many other excuses to not count a crash on the data set tesla has been lobbying to make this technology mandated so they can corner the market for years and have been intentionally hiding crash data to make it seem safer than it really is to prove that it should be mandated if you really look you can see countless articles all saying something like this but tesla pr department is good at its job they even pay youtubers to show favorable videos tesla uses youtubers test self driving tech public streets trained safety drivershtml fi hy tesla nhtsa storyhtml fi hy tesla nhtsa storyhtml safety regulators put tesla autopilot safety regulators put tesla autopilot its really simple make this technology an option but never a mandate any vehicle must have full capacity to be manually be driven including mirrors and everything like that its the best of both worlds the people who want it have it and the people who dont arent forced to use it

1848,its not only the technology that needs to be heavily regulated but the marketing and advertising auto manufacturers are making bold claims and selling this technology to normal folks who dont understand just how complex these systems are or how prone to failure they can be people are far too trusting of this tech and its going to get people killed
1849,shut the fuck up about how a self driving system that requires years and petabytes of data to train isnt literally perfect yet shut the fuck up every day we dont shift to fully autonomous driving literally hundreds of people die
1850,why do so many trust tesla when they know despite what system you work with there will be bugs and computer crashes why would tesla software be any different nothing is or ever will be perfect including tesla there will be faults coming from software design software coding software evaluation hardware design hardware faults and human interaction tesla undoubtedly knows all this and upgrading software introduces a level of uncertainty that is well uncertain some may think that the market will correct any problems that may be true but how many people have to get injured or die for that to happen should we let that happen when we ie the people and government might reduce the chance of future incidents the introduction of standard practices that must be followed

1853,this is what happens when software focused people get exposure to the real world they downplay the severity of the event its easy to laugh off a bad deployment if some service goes down less so when do something that inadvertently injurs or kills someone
1854,tesla is a software company just incidental that their software is deployed on machines that drive on public roads and can kill people when things go wrong sadly this is how they are also regulated for the most part
1855,how many ota of critical systems has tesla done and how many had to be retracted due to unforseen behaviour yeah its almost like they have an extensive testing and approval process in place for the fact that this is the st time they had to roll an ota back based on signals i might add there are reported accidents as a result of the retracted ota much ado about nothing this
1856,but are anecdotes data of the m miles between accidents in manual mode would be on freeway and m off of it for the m miles in autopilot m would be on freeway and just off of it so the manual record is roughly one accident per m miles off freeway and per m miles on freeway but the autopilot record ballparks to m miles between accidents off freeway and m on freeway in other words about longer without an accident in manual with forward collision avoidance on or tacc than in autopilot instead of being safer with autopilot it looks like a tesla is slightly less safe if i am testing the fsd beta i will probably be paying more attention than i would be actually driving myself its going to make driving so much more fun we know from decades of research that this is not true
1857,of the m miles between accidents in manual mode would be on freeway and m off of it for the m miles in autopilot m would be on freeway and just off of it so the manual record is roughly one accident per m miles off freeway and per m miles on freeway but the autopilot record ballparks to m miles between accidents off freeway and m on freeway in other words about longer without an accident in manual with forward collision avoidance on or tacc than in autopilot instead of being safer with autopilot it looks like a tesla is slightly less safe
1858,i am having trouble seeing in the validation pipeline any review and approval by external reviewers which is really standard in most physical engineering disciplines or in medical research and development or really most fields that combine highly technical skills with a public interest
1859,so its okay because the number of pedestrians that could be killed at any rushed test is limited
1860,using owners as your test platform is sloppy at best they can validate your testing when done in a controlled environment when they are informed that they are participating in a test rolling out an automatic update and triaging the results is incredibly irresponsible when the context is a machine that can kill someone when it operates knowing how they test doesnt make it any less sloppy
1861,you cant just roll out unsafe cars and say its fine its just in beta thats fine for a video game but cars can kill people theyre regulated just a bit stricter
1862,thank god nobody ever dies when humans drive themselves
1863,damn bro i didnt know i have been studied for decades how can something be studied for decades that has been out for months
1864,these folks just keep spewing unfounded marketing statements as if its fact i honk theyve watched too many ted videos of the m miles between accidents in manual mode would be on freeway and m off of it for the m miles in autopilot m would be on freeway and just off of it so the manual record is roughly one accident per m miles off freeway and per m miles on freeway but the autopilot record ballparks to m miles between accidents off freeway and m on freeway in other words about longer without an accident in manual with forward collision avoidance on or tacc than in autopilot instead of being safer with autopilot it looks like a tesla is slightly less safe

1866,internally testing an ai update can catch major and common flaws like running a red light or failing to notice a pedestrian and i think this is where regulation will come in the ai must pass these common situation without fail before an update may be released but its the rare or edge case situations that have to be tested in the wild and thats where the lets see what happens comes in lets use a semi fake example and pretend the next release has a flaw a fsd tesla will crash if its heading east on the freeway traveling at mph at sunrise heading into the rising sun with an ambulance stopped in the right lane with its lights on the tesla crashes into the ambulance because the ai has never seen this situation before who is going to think of this extremely specific scenario and test to make sure it doesnt happen probably no one until it happens then tesla would go in and fix the error and the ai will never crash under these circumstances again the problem with testing an ai update is that no single person or company is going to be able to test all driving scenarios before releasing the update if we are to be honest and open about fsd ai then we must acknowledge that the only true way to test an ai is to release it publicly and see what happens all this being said i think its fair to ask and discuss the following questions is fsd ai worth the risk would regulations be useful what should regulations cover other stuff i cant think of

1868,nothing says great engineering like having to take your car into the dealer for recalls because of a potential airbag failure or seatbelt failure or electrical issue which cuts your engine or endless list of recalled items thats real engineering right there cutting corners to sell products and avoiding consequences until the nhtsa tells you to fix the shit because its injuring or killing people thats why i only buy other companies products and you should too

1873,im more worried about the bystanders and other motorists who didnt pay to get crashed into by a misbehaving self driving algorithm public road is not the place for beta testing that is what testing grounds and tracks are for
1874,if pedestrian accidents with fsd become a common problem theyll probably pull it or regulators will get involved so far there hasnt been any pedestrian accidents so i dont see what youre complaining about i actually have fsd beta and while it needs a lot of work in some aspects of driving it actually recognizes and avoids pedestrians really well
1875,apples to apples this would be like boeing installing some software they tested in simulated hardware into beta planes out of airplanes in service and then when they noticed the beta planes were braking erroneously during pre flight checks and they were getting altitude warnings while still on the ground they rolled the software on the beta planes back to the previous version this is what caused the rollback to occur on the beta tesla vehicles false collision warnings and unnecessary auto emergency braking events might occur translated out if a beta car had someone tailgating at speed and there was a false collision warning then there might be an emergency braking event and that might lead to an accident due to the human driver following closer than is safe not quite the headline news event is it
1876,im not aware of any crash happening as a result of that update its more like if boeing finds a safety issue in a line of parts they made for s and recalls those parts
1877,it becomes a public beta when you become one of the testing obstacles on the road no one outside of the car can knowingly consent to participate in this beta because it isnt a beta its pre production testing on an incomplete product that can potentially kill someone
1878,according to no one but tesla themselves of the m miles between accidents in manual mode would be on freeway and m off of it for the m miles in autopilot m would be on freeway and just off of it so the manual record is roughly one accident per m miles off freeway and per m miles on freeway but the autopilot record ballparks to m miles between accidents off freeway and m on freeway in other words about longer without an accident in manual with forward collision avoidance on or tacc than in autopilot instead of being safer with autopilot it looks like a tesla is slightly less safe
1879,the step in issue has been studied in other industries for decades including aviation but nice cheap redditism there when you cant actually contribute something of content
1880,do other car manufacturers have their software tested by regulators what exactly did you see coming was there a crash
1881,youre going to claim youve not heard of a single auto pilot or fsd death lol pretty wild not to mention teslas own data shows more accidents with auto pilot than not
1882,cars dont just kill people bad drivers do now put those bad drivers in cars that actually do kill people
1883,i am under no impression that fsd is perfect or even good but the bar is pretty low for exceeding human capability lets do some quick math the fatality rate for human drivers is deaths per million miles traveled statisticsdetailstate by state tesla has about million cars with autopilot on the road cleantechnicacomover tesla vehicles with autopilot on the road the average driver drives miles per week cut our driving in half is it time for pay per mile insurance shbadaad so telsa drivers alone are collectively averaging million miles per week this means that even if the tesla autopilot got into a fatal accident once a week every single week that fatality rate would be more than twice as safe as human drivers i think you severely overestimate what it takes to be better than the average driver and just perceive a higher risk because its a loss of control not cause its actually riskier
1884,use car crashes to control population sizes so you have less people on the road and the cars have an easier time navigating with less obstacles
1885,use car crashes to control population sizes so you have less people on the road and the cars have an easier time navigating with less obstacles
1886,are tesla cars less safe though the only statistics ive seen show that they are times safer than average electrekcotesla autopilot engaged x lower chance accident than average car data when you count how many accidents per aggregate million miles driven does anyone have statistics that show otherwise
1887,its likely going to cost lives before we know it its likely already has cost lives its just nearly impossible for the public to know if fsd was engaged or not at the time of an accident
1888,im not aware of any crash happening as a result of that update and how much of the reason there was no crash was only due to the reactions of those around the vehicle at the time
1889,where are you getting those numbers because they dont match up with any source from the nhtsa cdannhtsagovtsftablesnationalstatisticspdf in there were accidents out of miles driven miles per accident from teslas most recent quarterly safety report they recorded m miles between accidents without autopilot enabled and m miles between accidents with autopilot enabled m k x more miles between accidents or put another way autopilot is safer than driving manually
1890,your math isnt making any sense youre saying ap goes over million miles without an accident then saying it goes million without an accident according to your math how does that make sense
1891,i can see your point but currently autopilot or fsd with human supervision still outperforms manual driving accident wise so there arent really any more broken eggs compared to how many eggs are already being broken also its not like an accident has to happen in order for fsd to improve
1892,most people who die in car accidents are either breaking laws or the victims of people who have broken laws i dont think its an acceptable standard to decide that as long as robots do about as well as or somewhat better than humans at driving that everything is cool since that also includes all the humans who have died because they were doing something that we have made illegal like speeding distracted driving drunk driving etc the benchmark we use should not be how well does autonomous driving do against the sum total of all humans it should be how well does autonomous driving do against all the humans killed in accidents where they were not speeding not drunk not texting and not sleepy and actually a robot has killed a person yeah it was stupid and yeah youll think its bullshit but there really was a person who was run over by a car when they were walking with their bike at night there have been more cases of people killed by ignoring instructions to keep their hands on a wheel and then self driving cars would fail to see semis in front of them its only zero ever if you decide to ignore fatalities that have happened with people who ignored instructions to keep their hands on the wheel but theres a difference between the duty of an engineering team to design something that is hard to misuse and the realities of people who get distracted teslas team of engineers could have made it impossible to use self driving in unsafe ways if they wanted to but instead a person fell asleep with autopilot on and got decapitated by a semi thats an annoying inconvenience to address but its still there

1895,i dont agree that haywire or calamity as another on this thread called it is remotely appropriate if you imagine a perfect drive buggy software seems imperfect but humans dont have perfect drives die every year in the us alone add to that the number of injured and the billions in financial damages and you have the true real world baseline for current driving so does a beta software released to s of specifically safe drivers all of whom have been told that the software will likely make bad choices at the worst time qualify as going haywire when it randomly hits the brakes hell no the user can take control instantly the user is supposed to be paying attention they are holding the wheel they are warned in advance the user is selected from a small group of humans specifically based on their ability to consistently drive safe predictably and smooth the situation is far less dangerous than a squirrel running across the road in front of a regular driver is a squirrel crossing the road in front of a car indicative of a super dangerous situation would you have told your friends your drive went haywire on the way home if that happened of course not you probably wouldnt have told anyone because its not newsworthy just like this whole post
1896,who died and yes that would still be a private beta because thats how the terminology works if i have a private beta on my phone and walk outside it doesnt suddenly become a public beta if it was a public beta then all tesla owners would have it and that would be significantly worse
1897,as opposed to what the actuarial tables the rest of our lives are based on im any other business the bankinsurancecompany can assume youre not financially soundunhealthyunfit for anything based on just knowing your age and gender do you really think actual digital driving records of your personal acceleration awareness and accidents is bullshit compared to what actual other data that is used in real life
1898,actually i did sign up for the beta test every advancement comes at a cost we wouldnt have covid vaccines without learning from people who died of it we wouldnt have nuclear power without radiation killing people who discovered it im actually surprised that self driving technology has advanced as far as it has without more human cost but its a worthwhile cost as long as non sec driving cars continue to kill more people every day try to step back and consider the bigger picture here

1900,sure could you do me a favor and name any other general public product or technology in all of human history that both has the ability to injure or kill people and was developed to perfection inside a facility such that no one was ever injuredkilled im interested in figuring out what you would consider a good example of what you want edit meant to direct this at op uwelivedintheocean
1901,just the facts for me unlike the haters where are all the crashes of teslas every single one is reported and still crickets

1903,planned obsolescence for cars program them to crash every years so that you have to buy a new one
1904,from that article in most tesla vehicles equipped with a version of autopilot to the autopilot features are mostly being used for highway drivingand the same distinction is not being done the average vehicle whichis based on nhtsas overall crash data in the usaccidents are more common on city roads and undivided roads than on the highway so its not a fair comparison

1906,of the m miles between accidents in manual mode would be on freeway and m off of it for the m miles in autopilot m would be on freeway and just off of it so the manual record is roughly one accident per m miles off freeway and per m miles on freeway but the autopilot record ballparks to m miles between accidents off freeway and m on freeway in other words about longer without an accident in manual with forward collision avoidance on or tacc than in autopilot instead of being safer with autopilot it looks like a tesla is slightly less safe
1907,you realize the miles to accident ratio for human drivers is crazy fucking higher than fsd accidents right why do people think they can out reaction time computers
1908,what thats not at all what i said i literally said it has never hit a pedestrian now in the future if this system is widely used and on the extremely rare event that someone is out of sight then lunges into the middle of the road and they get hit i would consider that unfortunate but nothing couldve been done so accidents will happen no matter who or what is driving if it becomes a pattern with statistical significance thats a different story
1909,that worked out great out for uber where one hired test driver killed a person in an autonomous test vehicle they probably have some drivers developers go out with their cars for testing but many of these kind of issues probably only get apparent on a large scale that is difficult to reach when you have to pay everyone there might also be some behavioral difference between actual people driving around and paid test drivers its also probably still better to have the car drive itself and brake too often instead of having people driving who are distracted by their phone stressed out drunk and tired
1910,i remember seeing this data years ago too specifically they were comparing the data before and after the model s gained the auto pilot features in like or so the accident rate on free ways halfed itself in one year for the model s just from the rollout thats now year old software
1911,im sorry but youre parroting the same shady thing tesla did tesla does not tabulate the same metric as the nhsta but instead uses a more severe crash instead of accident to make it appear as if fewer of them happen if ford came out and releases safety data only looking at times the airbag went off i dont think you keep your same opinion you just cant randomly make up apples to oranges comparisons arent safer on autopilot so researchers calling for driver monitoring may be right you also cant compare mostly freeway miles to all miles thats just laughably statistically biased

1913,well no not really of the m miles between accidents in manual mode would be on freeway and m off of it for the m miles in autopilot m would be on freeway and just off of it so the manual record is roughly one accident per m miles off freeway and per m miles on freeway but the autopilot record ballparks to m miles between accidents off freeway and m on freeway in other words about longer without an accident in manual with forward collision avoidance on or tacc than in autopilot instead of being safer with autopilot it looks like a tesla is slightly less safe tesla refuses to release the data or confirm on why it insists on using a different crash metric which only filters more severe crashes to make it look like theyve had fewer if it were better why play all these tricks

1916,cool i hope that holds up for them in court if their software kills people
1917,actually i did sign up for the beta test good for you the rest of the public did not we wouldnt have covid vaccines without learning from people who died of it yeah good try but not comparable either those were in clinical trials with informed consent or their catching covid was not part of anyones test try to step back and consider the bigger picture here me disagreeing with you does not mean i havent considered the bigger picture tesla is not an ngo with public good as their primary objective tesla is a for profit company but fanboys act like tesla is doing the lords work
1918,such that no one was ever injuredkilled probably very few incidents happen but that doesnt mean products like space heaters washing machines train engines and whatnot werent initially tested as much as possible inside a lab before deploying them on a large scale im not arguing vs having a couple of beta testers on the roads with safety glasses on here im arguing regular consumers shouldnt be enrolled in self driving software betas without being employed in some way by the company to do so and having done some specific safety training like if this was the new call of duty beta on the road want to test these cars hire some damn qa people to do so in simulations then in private roads and then on public roads and keep doing that until you dont consider that a beta at all at that point some incidents may yet happen and that is okay no tech is perfect

1921,yes and the crash can be in slow motion for safety like you would crack a hardboiled egg the car would just slowly crush all sides against a wall
1922,does it though because i can think of plenty of decent people that have lived miserable lives and died horrible deaths and plenty of the worst people who thrived on the suffering of others and died wealthy and peacefully warm in their beds karmaor at least the yuppified new age version is at best a coping mechanism for injustice and at worst an excuse for not doing anything about it
1923,that makes sense people turn it on and pay less attention i saw a video of a woman who hit a deer this deer didnt jump out in front of the car the deer walked slowly an easily avoided accident but the car didnt stop slow down or swerve it just happily kept driving people barely pay attention when they have to drive toss in the illusion of self driving its a wonder there arent alot more accidents

1927,cars kill people per year already if this software has a chance to decrease that youd have to be a sociopath to stop or significantly delay work on it if they were rolling things out to millions of people without communicating it or not explaining how to use it to the drivers or not fixing errors quickly sure but none of that is happening the world is literally dying from climate change and our government is in the middle of ignoring a coup we have real problems to care about why invent non problem problems
1928,i get youve got rage there are things i dont like too but youve gone past misunderstanding youre just lying now fsd and autopilot are literally separate code for different applications they are not in the same stack zero accidents on fsd beta though id be very surprised if you didnt already know that
1929,some of you may die but that is a sacrifice i am willing to make
1930,from q in the nd quarter we registered one accident for every million miles driven in which drivers had autopilot engaged by comparison nhtsas most recent data shows that in the united states there is an automobile crash every miles to q in the nd quarter we recorded one crash for every million miles driven in which drivers were using autopilot by comparison nhtsas most recent data shows that in the united states there is an automobile crash every miles seems to be making good progress

1936,i would rather robots kill and anyone who answers otherwise is a complete fucking moron who probably needs to be reminded to breathe
1937,i want to really sit down and chat with the guy who answers the former instead of the latter i dont like the way tesla is treating the idea of putting full on self driving cars out there as if its some cute little windows update for people to try on but what matters more than anything is the actual impact this has on human lives straight up if self driving overall reduces the number of vehicular fatalities and injuries even if it causes accidents where otherwise there objectively would not have been one it is a net positive and i fully encourage putting it out there in the safest way possible its hard to get over the mental flip out with the thought that maybe the robo brain in someones car decides to swerve for no reason and kills an innocent pedestrian but we dont react with the same blanket damnation over human driving when some drunk or tired driver goes careening into someones house and crushes someone whos sleeping in their bed the objective analysis needs to be the deciding factor self driving can be improved human error is much harder to govern but at the same time that also doesnt excuse a high error rate from fsd it will get better cant be an excuse if theres a net negative today

1939,yes if a human driver hits another human driver i suggest we ban them from driving as their algorithm is broken and should not be aloud to guide cars we dont do that though we look at the situation and we dont generally punish people for accidents if the driver was negligent theres jail time but if someone happened to dive in the drivers path at the last minute the driver is not at fault have to look at the issue beside we do regulate human drivers its called a drivers license yes and this applies here use of teslas autopilot in the road currently requires a licensed driver thats the regulatory rule take something like adaptive cruise control a common feature in many of the current cars if theres a problem with it and the car doesnt slow down as a result of the car in front of you the driver is expected to brake himself you wouldnt expect the feature of adaptive cruise control to be banned if theres a problem with it in a ford model youd expect ford to recall it and fix it if theres an accident as a result of it unless the bug was one that prevented the human from overriding the adaptive cruise control youd expect the driver to be punished the more advanced features of the tesla should fall in the same category as long as the regulation is that a licensed driver is required on the wheel the licensed driver has responsibility if autopilot kills someone and the driver didnt disengage the autopilot that driver should be punished and tesla is expected to recall the feature and fix it unless the bug is such that it prevented the driver from disengaging autopilot in which case tesla should be criminally responsible for negligence

1941,but an accident is different than a crash and youre not using nhts highway data like tesla is youre giving the same biased bullshit
1942,but an accident is different than a crash and youre not using nhts highway data like tesla is youre giving the same biased bullshit
1943,im not against evs renewables self driving or climate change actions what i am against is when a company purposefully obfuscates and hides data from a beta program that i am involved in but did not consent to we can aim to improve evs and self driving without gargling elons cock if a company is going to be testing self driving vehicles on public roads then all their test data should be publicly available and they should be able to be held accountable if a fluke in the software ends up killing someone
1944,oh are we resorting to that now ok i guess youre a shill for big oil how many planes crashed before the first commercial flight how many injuries came from model ts from the first railways heck from the first printing presses is there any technology or product in existence that has the ability to injurekill and was developed without any injuries or deaths talk about living in fantasy

1946,well youd have a ford blue cruisegm cruise scenario where it never works until an oem figures it out for them meanwhile traffic accidents continue to happen people still text and drive etc etc were just not used to seeing the sausage being made for like cars which is what they make in fremont in day its such a small subset that gets blown out of proportion articles etc make it sound like tesla has rolled out a beta to the entire fleet and people are crashing and dying en masse which is just not the case

1948,their self reported stats are misleading talk to me when theyre driving around cities small towns or areas with higher amounts of crashes than a highway tesla autopilot statistics show its almost as safe driving with it as without

1950,i think the point that a lot of people are making is that tesla self driving is being beta tested on the public in a manner than no one outside the tesla can knowingly consent to as long as the self driving mode is being used on public roads full crash data and statistics should be publicly available with the ability to hold the company accountable when it falls short and their car kills someone

1952,what a stunning counter argument from a neanderthal whose greatest social skill is a shaky grasp on the ad hominem
1953,although i would say we disagree about the amount of times a humanrobot gets to hit a human before their banned is your number because if the algorithm is flawed in such a way that it hits humans half as much the average number of pedestrians hit by human drivers then everyone enabling the algorithm would decrease the number of accidents by half even if good drivers who would otherwise not hit a human end up being in a car where the human is hit because that was compensated by the fact that bad drivers that would hit a pedestrian ended up not hitting one in general we dont need the robot to be better than the best human driver we just need to be better than the overall average
1954,as much as some people will piss and moan because theyd rather drive the majority of people would rather sleep watch youtube and movies or play games the benefits of self driving cars far out weigh your love of driving people died in automobile related accidents in the us last year autonomous cars are already much better drivers than we are and will only continue to improve car loan payments are one of the largest expenses for the average family especially considering most families have at least cars most of the time those cars sit idle in your garage or a parking lot with fleets of self driving cars companies like uber or lyft could replace your car loan with a subscription fee with a specified number of miles and pick ups per day with potentially hundreds of dollars per month in savings its a no brainer

1956,the only truly important regulation would be car makers are liable for all accidents caused by the self driving car that alone should guarantee that they will spend billions of dollars in research ensuring that the car is both safe for autonomous driving as well as secure against remote hacks any other fixed regulation will just get them to comply with the minimum legal requirements and there isnt any guarantee that those regulations are perfect or even optimal for self driving car safety in fact the government has even hinted that it doesnt want to impose too many regulations on the car makers because its still an infant domain it makes sense but as i said if they were reliable that would be all the incentive they needed to ensure maximum safety and security
1957,currently us highway deaths account for crashes every week think they maybe have that backwards
1958,currently us highway deaths account for crashes every week think they maybe have that backwards
1959,currently us highway deaths account for crashes every week in comparison googles autonomous car has driven over million miles with only one minor incident caused by the artificial intelligence that is not enough numbers without the total number of highway miles driven in the us each week this data is meaningless
1960,currently us highway deaths account for crashes every week in comparison googles autonomous car has driven over million miles with only one minor incident caused by the artificial intelligence that is not enough numbers without the total number of highway miles driven in the us each week this data is meaningless
1961,we mostly need the laws so they can sell the tech not because people will actually follow them speed limits exist too meanwhile everyones cruising over everywhere and keep in mind its still extremely early days for this stuff even though it is safer than humans its not and wont be people are still going to die in the hands of self driving cars just with any luck itll be tens per year and not tens of thousands
1962,its not safer by a long shot i never had a accident stop buying the hype google had a ai and played it off and all the fan boys agreed to it
1963,exactly if you want to drive for fun go to a track let the computers handle the mundane driving and prevent accidents no amount of fun should overrule the publics safety
1964,seriously like legalizing drugs self driving cars are going to absolutely kill citypolice revenue from officer citations and court fines like the drug system theres an entire network of money circling around traffic violations i dont think theyre going to go down easilyits sad for your safety
1965,many commercial trucks in the us are owner operated theyll buy the tech for themselves also the reduction in accidents will result in lower insurance premiums and fewer lawsuits fromagainst their drivers from there it will just be a math problem as to whether autopilot tech is purchased or not
1966,if they make the wrong decision someone dies and the company that programmed it gets sued but youre talking about if they make the wrong decision because a human driver is doing something theyre not supposed to like some of whom are doing in heavy traffic weaving between cars in that scenario id think that its that human driver thats going to get sued
1967,and people dont die because were more reliable than machines s
1968,a car stepping in to stop you crashing is a long way off the reaosn self driving cars are safe is they avoid dangerous situations theyre not actually much better than most humans at averting an imminent crash
1969,why as a human youre much more dangerous other people are at risk even to the extent that compulsary rd party insurance removes the risk of you costing other parties money theres still the risk you could maim or kill them should people still have the option to drive extremely old unsafe cars in many juristictions classic car enthusiasts arent allowed to take their old cars on the roads also synergy between autonomous vehicles means the road networks will work better without human drivers even a small number of human drivers will cause problems
1970,with the uber or lyft subscription i mentioned earlier you could potentially opt for reduced rate for car pooling you wouldnt head over to your buddies house youd pick up someone whos going to the same place or is on a similar route as you it would be calculated by an algorithm and would be much more efficient congestion and fuel wise its not for everyone but the reduced price would be attractive to many people
1971,its just silly because gasoline cars catch on fire more often than teslas and kill tons of people i dont think a single person has been killed in a tesla fire especially since the underbody upgrade
1972,on the contrary i dont consider my realistic outcome to be extreme what youre doing right now is being accidentally anchored enwikipediaorgwikianchoring by my two initial suggestions in reality the biggest extreme is the extinction of humanity due to the singularity followed by enslavement due to the singularity followed by an eternal and robot enforced police state followed by world war followed by economic collapse before full automation happens and then only finally is there my actually rather optimistic outcome of the present extension of our current economic model in fact my two suggestions are both well into the positive future outcomes for humanity im ever the optimist
1973,umm automated lane control and auto braking have been saving people from crashes for a couple years now with excellent dash cam videos of the events shared on reddit regularly i agree it wont magically save you after the car is already out of control but if you arent braking when you should be or you are going straight when the road is curving you can definitely be saved by the machine

1975,its public infrastructure that weve all paid for and share more force at gunpoint all licensure is the government taking rights and selling them back people can refrain from doing certain things until they learn the skills involved it happens in a number of different industries do you really think its okay to haul someone off to jail for driving without a license if theyve never hurt anyone
1976,people are so bad at driving cars that computers dont have to be that good to be much better marc andreessen vehicle collisions kill more people annually as hivaids which is considered an epidemic it one of the top causes of death worldwide and the only one which is not related to disease or cancer research and root cause analysis indicates that over of all vehicular collisions were preventable self driving cars are literally a vaccine for this which can save over a million lives every year in addition to making the driving experience cheaper yes cheaper less stressful and faster for everyone involved congress should be pointing a money hose at this not trying to regulate it to death in its infancy
1977,but the first autonomous vehicle crash is going to be extremely novel no kidding people still bring up the guy in florida that got killed while autopilot was engaged nobody mentions that the autopilot didnt cause the accident the driver of the other vehicle did the autopilot just failed to recognize it was in danger of collision
1978,but the first autonomous vehicle crash is going to be extremely novel no kidding people still bring up the guy in florida that got killed while autopilot was engaged nobody mentions that the autopilot didnt cause the accident the driver of the other vehicle did the autopilot just failed to recognize it was in danger of collision
1979,but the first autonomous vehicle crash is going to be extremely novel no kidding people still bring up the guy in florida that got killed while autopilot was engaged nobody mentions that the autopilot didnt cause the accident the driver of the other vehicle did the autopilot just failed to recognize it was in danger of collision
1980,this is exactly right imo the thing with self driving cars is that when they have a flaw in their code that allows an accidentdeath to occur that flawcode is corrected and the update is rolled out so that accident never happens again
1981,people prefer to be in control and result in the death of people than let a robot be in control and potentially kill if a driver kills its an accident if a robot kills its bad programming and intended its going to be a long time until people accept the new av paradigm as safer and even if right now many people already know that they are safer they will still dont release the wheel

1983,pretty obvious computers are not distracted nor drunk driving isnt an art form its a science and its not a difficult thing to do consider the dumbest people you know can still keep the car on the road of course theres exceptions road conditions road work pedestrians other cars accidents but thats what google has been working on for over a decade via real mileage and simulations the beauty of it is that with one accident we can take the data and train all cars instead of a few surviving participants its painfully obvious computers humans at driving
1984,also note that in most countries cars kill more people than guns every major car accident should have news outlets calling for driverless cars just like they call for more gun control with each mass shooting
1985,also note that in most countries cars kill more people than guns every major car accident should have news outlets calling for driverless cars just like they call for more gun control with each mass shooting
1986,if you let these things onto the road in imperfect condition you are sure to kill any chance of building enough trust with consumers for wide implementation no one is going to want a self driving car if they hear about self driving car accidents regularly and you can bet your ass that every mass media outlet will bring every single incident in the largest possible headline font people wont care what statistics say if they keep hearing about how self driving cars are dangerous because x of them crashed or had near accidents in the past month
1987,if you let these things onto the road in imperfect condition you are sure to kill any chance of building enough trust with consumers for wide implementation no one is going to want a self driving car if they hear about self driving car accidents regularly and you can bet your ass that every mass media outlet will bring every single incident in the largest possible headline font people wont care what statistics say if they keep hearing about how self driving cars are dangerous because x of them crashed or had near accidents in the past month

1989,here is another thing to worry about driving is a skill what happens when nobody drives anymore and then something gets messed up and everyone needs to drive again what do you do
1990,and that their own mad driving skillz wont save them from the drivers they already know are bad honestly though even knowing how much safer self driving cars are its a weird feeling knowing that you really have no influence over the risk despite knowing that it is reduced thats another hurdle even after you get people to accept the numbers
1991,people arent really the problem honestly if you give people the ability to have a self driving uber show up at their door and drive them wherever they need to go whenever they need to go for a fraction of the cost of automotive ownership people will use it in droves the problem is all the industries people having that level of convenience and safety disrupts those industries auto manufacturing petrochemical insurance rely on every commuter needing or wanting their own personal vehicle they dont make enough money otherwise and if that means they keep driving over a million dead bodies most of whom are children a year to do it thats exactly what theyre going to keep doing and why they bribe governments to kill self driving technology
1992,people arent really the problem honestly if you give people the ability to have a self driving uber show up at their door and drive them wherever they need to go whenever they need to go for a fraction of the cost of automotive ownership people will use it in droves the problem is all the industries people having that level of convenience and safety disrupts those industries auto manufacturing petrochemical insurance rely on every commuter needing or wanting their own personal vehicle they dont make enough money otherwise and if that means they keep driving over a million dead bodies most of whom are children a year to do it thats exactly what theyre going to keep doing and why they bribe governments to kill self driving technology
1993,that flawcode is corrected and the update is rolled out so that accident never happens again a programmer will probably tell you that fixing bugs in complex systems is more of an art than a science though im pretty excited at the prospects of unit testing for these kinds of things conceivably the sensor readouts prior to every accident can be perfectly recorded and used as a test data for future updates whereby the software must make the correct decision when faced with the known crash conditions before its allowed to be deployed
1994,that flawcode is corrected and the update is rolled out so that accident never happens again a programmer will probably tell you that fixing bugs in complex systems is more of an art than a science though im pretty excited at the prospects of unit testing for these kinds of things conceivably the sensor readouts prior to every accident can be perfectly recorded and used as a test data for future updates whereby the software must make the correct decision when faced with the known crash conditions before its allowed to be deployed
1995,in this context imperfect means not guaranteed to never crash self driving technology is already safe enough to be unlikely to crash and potentially already better than people
1996,i know a guy who killed people with his drunk driving natural selection has shit to do with it hes still alive but fortunately in jail after the second incident
1997,what happens when you need to reach a hospital the car just wont go anywhere nope you die govt says i cant go anywhere
1998,the argument tends to boil down to x amount of people die from y so we should ban y while im sure there wouldnt be an explicit law banning older not self driving cars i worry that it would be prohibitively expensive through either insurance or fuel cost
1999,people could retain manual control of their vehicles if you dont practice driving regularly your driving skills go to shit this is exactly why people complain about sunday drivers
2000,i understand your perspective but already most people cant respond appropriately in a vehicular emergency because they never practice emergency driving most people dont know how to brake effectively control a skidding vehicle or maneuver in an emergency the notion that people have driving skills beyond the most rudimentary basics is not true in most cases
2001,having had a work at home job after a long commute job and having practiced emergency stuff as a teenager i can guarantee that driving skills go to shit fairly quickly if you limit your driving you seem to be thinking im disagreeing with you when im actually emphasizing your point
2002,of the m miles between accidents in manual mode would be on freeway and m off of it for the m miles in autopilot m would be on freeway and just off of it so the manual record is roughly one accident per m miles off freeway and per m miles on freeway but the autopilot record ballparks to m miles between accidents off freeway and m on freeway in other words about longer without an accident in manual with forward collision avoidance on or tacc than in autopilot instead of being safer with autopilot it looks like a tesla is slightly less safe tesla refuses to release the data or confirm on why it insists on using a different crash metric which only filters more severe crashes to make it look like theyve had fewer if it were better why play all these tricks
2003,of the m miles between accidents in manual mode would be on freeway and m off of it for the m miles in autopilot m would be on freeway and just off of it so the manual record is roughly one accident per m miles off freeway and per m miles on freeway but the autopilot record ballparks to m miles between accidents off freeway and m on freeway in other words about longer without an accident in manual with forward collision avoidance on or tacc than in autopilot instead of being safer with autopilot it looks like a tesla is slightly less safe tesla refuses to release the data or confirm on why it insists on using a different crash metric which only filters more severe crashes to make it look like theyve had fewer if it were better why play all these tricks

2005,it depends on which metrics you care about counting every mph ding where no one gets hurt isnt going to give a good indication about whether its safer or not so if the metric you care about is personal safety then you would exclude accidents where there isnt harm if you care more about property than personal safety then you would include all accidents
2006,but why would you compare mph dings for everyone else and only when the airbags go off for yourself that seems like a large swath of accidents would be counted on your list pretty biased and slimy if you cant actually compare apples to apples or oranges to oranges
2007,are you saying that they dont use the same rules for counting manual and autopilot accidents according to their safety report methodology listed on the bottom of their safety report page methodology we collect the amount of miles traveled by each vehicle with autopilot active or in manual driving based on available data we receive from the fleet and do so without identifying specific vehicles to protect privacy we also receive a crash alert anytime a crash is reported to us from the fleet which may include data about whether autopilot was active at the time of impact to ensure our statistics are conservative we count any crash in which autopilot was deactivated within seconds before impact and we count all crashes in which the incident alert indicated an airbag or other active restraint deployed our crash statistics are not based on sample data sets or estimates in practice this correlates to nearly any crash at about mph kph or above depending on the crash forces generated on the other hand police reported crashes from government databases are notoriously under reported by some estimates as much as in large part because most minor crashes like fender benders are not investigated we also do not differentiate based on the type of crash or fault for example more than of all autopilot crashes occur when the tesla vehicle is rear ended by another vehicle in this way we are confident that the statistics we share unquestionably show the benefits of autopilot there isnt a differentiation between the manual or autopilot methodology in here so its very apples to apples
2008,are you saying that they dont use the same rules for counting manual and autopilot accidents according to their safety report methodology listed on the bottom of their safety report page methodology we collect the amount of miles traveled by each vehicle with autopilot active or in manual driving based on available data we receive from the fleet and do so without identifying specific vehicles to protect privacy we also receive a crash alert anytime a crash is reported to us from the fleet which may include data about whether autopilot was active at the time of impact to ensure our statistics are conservative we count any crash in which autopilot was deactivated within seconds before impact and we count all crashes in which the incident alert indicated an airbag or other active restraint deployed our crash statistics are not based on sample data sets or estimates in practice this correlates to nearly any crash at about mph kph or above depending on the crash forces generated on the other hand police reported crashes from government databases are notoriously under reported by some estimates as much as in large part because most minor crashes like fender benders are not investigated we also do not differentiate based on the type of crash or fault for example more than of all autopilot crashes occur when the tesla vehicle is rear ended by another vehicle in this way we are confident that the statistics we share unquestionably show the benefits of autopilot there isnt a differentiation between the manual or autopilot methodology in here so its very apples to apples

2010,where is the source for the nhsta crash data
2011,because you cannot do that without bias tesla does not report the same statistics if you compare them its not apples to apples and tesla will look like less because they have only more serious crashes included if you use biased data youre going to get biased results tesla carefully chose their language and recklessly compared different data arent safer on autopilot so researchers calling for driver monitoring may be right
2012,because you cannot do that without bias tesla does not report the same statistics if you compare them its not apples to apples and tesla will look like less because they have only more serious crashes included if you use biased data youre going to get biased results tesla carefully chose their language and recklessly compared different data arent safer on autopilot so researchers calling for driver monitoring may be right
2013,how can you compare such different accidents
2014,first and foremost its something of a logical fallacy yes on average self driving cars have a lower accident rate but if youre a safe driver you might have a lower accident rate than a self driving car also you have control over how safely you drive whereas in a self driving car youre not in control of the risk factors tesla is known for covering up high profile crashes with their autopilot system you can read more on that if youre interested
2015,first and foremost its something of a logical fallacy yes on average self driving cars have a lower accident rate but if youre a safe driver you might have a lower accident rate than a self driving car also you have control over how safely you drive whereas in a self driving car youre not in control of the risk factors tesla is known for covering up high profile crashes with their autopilot system you can read more on that if youre interested
2016,first and foremost its something of a logical fallacy yes on average self driving cars have a lower accident rate but if youre a safe driver you might have a lower accident rate than a self driving car also you have control over how safely you drive whereas in a self driving car youre not in control of the risk factors tesla is known for covering up high profile crashes with their autopilot system you can read more on that if youre interested
2017,accident rates are mostly a red herring fully autonomous self driving will never happen without the us government putting up enough money on road infrastructure to effectively turn roads into railroads all the rhetoric about accident rates or precision is a way to enforce this completely false notion of technological inevitability so that car companies can appropriate more public subsidies for private gain its actually very similar to how the development of counterforce nuclear strategy and therefore nuclear armament escalation hinged on the supposed inevitability of missile precision improvements which would not have been developed without the political decision to develop the arsenal for counterforce in the first place
2018,accident rates are mostly a red herring fully autonomous self driving will never happen without the us government putting up enough money on road infrastructure to effectively turn roads into railroads all the rhetoric about accident rates or precision is a way to enforce this completely false notion of technological inevitability so that car companies can appropriate more public subsidies for private gain its actually very similar to how the development of counterforce nuclear strategy and therefore nuclear armament escalation hinged on the supposed inevitability of missile precision improvements which would not have been developed without the political decision to develop the arsenal for counterforce in the first place
2019,i guess what im interested to know is if fully automated driving became legal would the number of accidents and fatalities go up or down it is or course impossible to know for sure which is why i was wondering if anyone has seriously tried to modelestimate it if you have any good tesla cover up links handy and wanna save me a few minutes feel free to post i was under the impression though that tesla was not at the cutting edge of self driving its more google and the other major car companies
2020,fuck it we all die
2021,triple kill
2022,double kill
2023,like my uncle used to say kill them all and let god sort them out but lets never talk about him again
2024,that game is called beamng and is one of the most fun simulator arcade games there is because of the crash physics i recommend checking it out
2025,its about a self driving car which breaks arent working and it kills at least one so which should it be
2026,ohh thank godi was like someone fittin ta die
2027,insurance companies wont like that how can you be legally pressed to pay them their monthly extortion installments if you arent legally responsible for an accident caused by the vehicle
2028,i only want self driving for the boring motorway and in a stop start stop queue i like driving on the side streets i just hope the goal of absolutely no accidents in any situation doesnt foul up progress in long distance automatic driving
2029,if you sat at the front of the dlr and an accident occurred elon would blame you
2030,liability is a problem sure self driving reduces accidents by something like but thats still a lot of death every day for a company to take on by itself its already very unlikely that your fatal car accident makes it to local news beyond the traffic report they happen so frequently
2031,i hate this term assisted driving is the only way to stop the accidents in the first place
2032,here in the usa we had a case where one of the people in one of these self driving cars was basically thrown under the bus by the car company saying it was their fault it was really sad the person who was the test driver was a trans woman and had multiple felonies for various non violent things obviously this person struggled a lot in their life and got this job of being a test driver because there really didnt need to be any qualifications all they did was sit in the drivers seat and they were to intervene and take manual control of the car if something went wrong xb well this poor person was arrested thrown in jail and slandered after some crackhead basically ran themself into the car effectively killing themself the car company forget the name i think it was waymo blamed it all on this poor person saying they should have been paying attention and steered away they had video from inside the car of course and the tester was just sitting there playing on their phone when suddenly out of the blue comes some person on a bike straight into the car this happened so fast it was pretty much two seconds from when the camera sees the person on the bike to the impact this also happened at night so it is unlikely the test driver even if they werent staring at their phone would have seen much less been able to anticipate thebike riders actions not to mention the car had the headlights on and could clearly be seen yet the bike rider still drove immediately in front of them which to me seemed to indicate they probably werent perceptually aware enough to understand the vehicle was closer than they were thinking it was xb long story short the test driver was sent to jail for manslaughter and nothing happened to the company they took no responsibility
2033,for all autonomous cars are fantastic i dont see it happening any time soon and mostly for the reasons around morality the question is not if the question is when does the car protect the driver in all instances or a pedestrian does the car preference an older person over a younger one does the car preference a pregnant woman or a couple there will be situations where death of someone is nearly assured and what the car decides will be out of the hands of anyone involved in the crash and likely the systems and its inbuilt morality will be based on the morals of a different country likely the us or japan regulation is also an absolute nightmare and i find it really surprising that we are so convinced by self driving cars when self driving trains are still not the norm whos liable is just a fraction of these huge issues
2034,it might be obvious if the cars were always self driving the problem is that at the moment they are only partly so and that will probably continue for a long time this means that the car will hand control over to the user at times and may do so at short notice when the user is not paying attention if a crash results is that going to be legally the fault of the user or of the company which designed the car which handed over control while the user was pouring coffee if the company goes out of business must any cars of that brand be taken off the road despite a good safety record i can see the arguments for holding the company entirely responsible and i used to take this line now i think that it cant be simplified that much
2035,what about if a car crashes in self drive mode but the owner has made unauthorised modifications to the system its not a fully black or white scenario
2036,what about if a car crashes in self drive mode but the owner has made unauthorised modifications to the system its not a fully black or white scenario
2037,this should all but kill the car insurance industry except maybe damage theft if possible and battery insurance
2038,these cars are likely to be effectively robot driven cabs you dont pay for insurance when you hire a cab get on a bus or a train and you arent responsible if the driver has an accident that you didnt cause as others have said the future is going to be cars as a service rather than buying them i want to go to the shops open an app the car shows up and takes you where you want to go and leaves that helps solve the problem of people not having driveways or places to charge their cars too
2039,i would say if i buy a car and let it loose on the road and it smashes through a shop window it would be my responsibility since i was the one who directed it i would need insurance to cover the cost the insurance company could then try to recover their cost from either myself or the manufacturer also if i do not keep it maintained eg bald tyres which causes an accident when the vehicle can not break in time then i would be responsible for the accident
2040,the car would be able to record if someone took control of the car before an accident all that telemetry can be analysed
2041,yeah this makes me think of a pilot still being responsible if his plane crashes while on autopilot he still has to be attentive
2042,yeah this makes me think of a pilot still being responsible if his plane crashes while on autopilot he still has to be attentive
2043,easily the manufacturer will insure the car except they wont they wont have any need to insurance is useful for low risk catastrophically costly one offs where when something goes wrong its a struggle to pay for whatever it is from cash flow so for a person car crashes and house fires would be those things for the likes of ford and toyota however absorbing the cost of much much lower risk autonomous vehicle car crashes would be near negligible and so absorbed by routine cash flow we are still a couple decades away from autonomous vehicle safety reaching this point but eventually they will kill off the car insurance industry

2046,car insurance is compulsory due to the high rate of expensive accidents otherwise it wouldnt be needed it isnt compulsory for bikespramsroller skates because the rate of claims would be vastly exceeded by admin costs so yes with safe cars insurance could cease although probably wouldnt since old habits die hard
2047,car insurance is compulsory due to the high rate of expensive accidents otherwise it wouldnt be needed it isnt compulsory for bikespramsroller skates because the rate of claims would be vastly exceeded by admin costs so yes with safe cars insurance could cease although probably wouldnt since old habits die hard
2048,elon i had to kill bob morton because he made a mistake now its time to erase that mistake
2049,you would have been responsible for stopping the car speeding up to mph if you are supposed to be supervising you must be supervising all of the time not just when an accident happens you would be responsible for ensuring not only that there isnt an accident but that the vehicle is driving safely if the car is doing up to a blind corner then you have failed to supervise
2050,you are experiencing a car accident youtubeezknushqsi
2051,that sounds like a fun legal complication what if i realise that im about to crash due to the ap and to try to avoid it i activate manual steering yet i still crash is this now my fault im sure the car company would argue that it is but how exactly are we supposed to know when the algorithm is failing its recognition procedure or running into an unknown situation a little bit of knowledge of computer vision shows us that most cv algorithms are black box products at the end of the day and even the people who designed them are often in the dark as to why a singular point of failure happened
2052,tbh at this point weve had decades to resolve the ethical issues im starting to think its going to end up being done how it always gets done just doing it anyway and then seeing what enough people get angry enough or die from to make laws about all part of the process
2053,teslas specifically detect where a crash might occur such as people pulling out on them and transfer control back to the user seconds before impact occurs even if the driver cant make any reasonable steps to prevent collision in these cases this way elon can proudly announce that the car was under the control of the driver when it crashed its a bit like disney world banning doctors and coroners from the parks so that the beheaded accident victims can be legally declared dead off site

2055,then you need to look up what a self driving car actually is if your car has cruise control its a level self driving car and has literally the same result crash textawomancrashedhernewtimewhentheaccidenthappened drivers need to learn how to use the tools their vehicles come with responsibly

2057,absorbing the cost of much much lower risk autonomous vehicle car crashes would be near negligible and so absorbed by routine cash flow really i find it hard to believe these large companies will open the doors to liability sure all the expected events are one thing but to open the door to the unforseen that itself could be catastrophic

2059,well at the moment the companies say that the driver is at fault regardless of what happens as theyre supposed to keep a hand on the wheel at all time to maintain control but like anything else it will be a case by case analysis and will depend entirely on individual circumstances there is no one size fits all when it comes to determining what happened during a car crash
2060,a level self driving car will not just dump an emergency in your lap it must transfer control in a safe way so for example might stop on a dirt track and require the occupant to take over if a level car is on a motorway and there is a crash ahead it will take evasive action otherwise its level
2061,mon dieu
2062,yes and amazingly the program written by the car company records that the cause of the accident is always the fault of the driver and you can absolutely trust that because its not like global car companies have a history of programming cheat code into their cars
2063,it will probably come down to the manufacturer wanting to market the vehicle as fully autonomous verses not wanting to take responsibility for crashes i guess they will see which one they belive will make the moat profit

2066,third party damage id say you recoup your loss the same way as loss through any other type of accident or a more accessible small claims court but that would screw people over that need it the most so good catch i think food a basic food package should be a human right the reliance on food banks for the poorest is a travesty survival should be easy
2067,okay well i agree a basic provision of good food from the government is not a bad thing i just think car insurance is not top of the list of things the government should provide but currently dont one problem is that if you charge everyone the same amount is moral hazard or maybe its called something else but high insurance costs keep certain drivers off the road if suddenly it cost the same or was free at the point of use for everyone then you could expect more bad drivers on the road and higher crashes and deaths if you do base it on risk similar to now the problem you get is that you will only get one price currently there are lots of companies offering a quote for you so what you may find is that it actually becomes more expensive for certain people thats because each insurance company currently takes a slightly different view on risk i get the point that if its legally needed why should there be a profit made from it thought but i think loads of things are needed to different degrees where profit is currently made

2069,autopilot safetyhtml at least three tesla drivers have died since while driving with autopilot engaged
2070,i honestly love this idea ive been imagining this sort of thing for a while now but i assume therell be something that comes along and ruins it for a start if theyre all synchronised with some kind of centralised server someone is going to try and hack that server but even in that rare case i imagine theyd still result in fewer accidents and deaths than we see on our roads currently
2071,what about tying accidents to the points system on your licence do many in a period of time and you have to retake the test or re education like speed awareness classes im not sure you would have more bad drivers those same bad drivers exist but now they only pay more if that poor driving impacts somebody else you could be terrible but as long as you dont get caught speeding or are lucky enough for other drivers to compensate for each mistake then you are on the same footing as a perfectly competent driver the one price problem is something that while i have no evidence for feel like theres a certain level of collusion to the way insurance is calculated for example mce just had their underwriters pull out being the company offering way lower than others it looks like its not viable to be the cheapest and taking on anyone even with a huge excess
2072,what about tying accidents to the points system on your licence do many in a period of time and you have to retake the test or re education like speed awareness classes the problem is those accidents have already happened risk based pricing segments the population to give the same price to similar people well its only the same if all the variables match but it will give largely similar prices to similar people this information is known ahead of time ie before an accident occurs of course once claims happen past claims will also be used to determine price but many people will get very high insurance without having a claim xb im not sure you would have more bad drivers those same bad drivers exist but now they only pay more if that poor driving impacts somebody else you could be terrible but as long as you dont get caught speeding or are lucky enough for other drivers to compensate for each mistake then you are on the same footing as a perfectly competent driver so yes and no if you segment by age and occupation and postcode and other factors you will see a big difference in the frequency and severity of crashes of these people so these people would pay way more than and older person with no claims history yet neither of these people have ever caused any issues for other drivers on the road xb the one price problem is something that while i have no evidence for feel like theres a certain level of collusion to the way insurance is calculated why there currently isnt a one price problem im saying if the government did it on a risk based approach you would only get one price currently you can go on compare the market or whatever and gets loads of different prices insurers will react to other insurers prices changes for lots of reasons including the other insurers have increased prices and so they know something we dont like wise for decreasing prices they are currently too competitive and dont want to take on any new business as we do not have the staffing levels to maintain a good quality of customer service similarly they may decrease prices not because the risk has decreased but because they simply want to grow the business if all the insurance companies were very good at pricing the risk correctly you would expect all the prices return to be very similar but that not the case as all insurers have different target markets and business strategies they have different risk models with different risk variables going into those models

2075,imo this technology will never reach the point where it is safer than human drivers i really cant understand why companies are pissing away so much money on something that is really not needed what is going to happen when the computer that makes the whole thing work crashes the sensors fail or some mud gets on the road and the vehicle in front of it kicks up the mud and it covers up the sensors and the autonomous vehicle cant see the car in front of it or the edge of the road i also want to see what happens when one of these self driving cars meets a farmer driving a huge tractor or a combine on a narrow country road is the computer going to be able to pull the car off onto the shoulder to let the machine pass or is it going to get squished under the huge tires like the junkers at a monster truck rally i get so fed up with new technology sometimes that i am really tempted to just go join the amish they live pretty much the same way my grandparents did until the end of wwii and there is a lot to be said for that lifestyle my grandparents got their first car circa but didnt have electricity in their farmhouse until and my grandad farmed with horses until only two decades before i was born

2082,considering googles experience http moneycnncomautosgoogle self driving car injury accident with it not long
2083,im all for killing auto insurance companies
2084,im not sure of the risk is removed yet automotive deaths are already approaching the lowest ever numbers well since traffic became a think combine with us not knowing where the self driving ceiling will be i think auto insurance is going to last a while and then itll just be a liability shift we wont stop having accidents reality just doesnt allow for that claim maybe states will all become no fault states and your insurance covers your car maybe there will still be liability coverage for as others mentioned badly maintained vehicles causing harm i dont love insurance companies but as long as things go bad theres a market for mitigating the damages
2085,liabilities are still going to exist what happens when your brand new tesla gets slammed into by a self driving car that some kid got used for cheap and the lydar system is shot what happens when you upload uber into your car so it can go earn some cash for you while you sleep and a freak event occurs your car has to choose between killing one or ten who is responsible for the death you uber the car manufacturer i want self driving cars more than anything but the fact that some people take shit care of their cars means crashes could still happen

2088,i see the insurance cost being carried by the car manufacturer if a car is self driving and i have no input why would i carry a liability insurance policy if my only decision is to go from point a to point b then i shouldnt have any liability for any accidents caused by car software etc and shouldnt have to pay for a policy of course the government is the government and theyll be pushed by insurance company lobbyists to still require that car owners hold liability insurance i figure itll take a few decades before people start realizing that nobodys personal liability insurance paid out in a long time and shouldnt be required either that or the rates will be so low that it just wont matter
2089,what happens when you upload uber into your car so it can go earn some cash for you while you sleep and a freak event occurs your car has to choose between killing one or ten who is responsible for the death this railroad switch gets thrown around a lot but the self driving car will never ever choose who to run over it will use all available traction to stop while staying in its designated lane of travel someone will kill themselves by leaping under a sdc sooner or later but the sdc wont end up being liable in that specific case just as a human driver wouldnt be liable
2090,why would premiums increase just because the absolute number of drivers is smaller the risk of collision is the same or perhaps even lower since autonomous cars may be less likely to get into accidents with human drivers than other humans are
2091,thank you i get really annoyed at how much the trolley problem gets brought up i dont think it is really relevant at all the sdv will simply try to avoid hitting anything or getting in any kind of accident by being able to look in all directions never lose attention and constantly be trying to predict the path and behavior of everything around them they should be able to avoid most bad situations long before they have gotten to the point where some intractable eitheror moral judgement needs to be made besides i kinda doubt in the world of human drivers theres too often that you are realistically put into a trolley problem type scenario in the first place again you dont think oh im going to hit those nuns or that group of school children better make up my mind you think oh shit im out of control can i at least try and miss those groups of people
2092,hug frequency trading provides liquidity when it is least needed recall the flash crash all the high frequency traders stopped trading in a flash its like flood insurance that does not pay when an flood hits your city
2093,be more expensive because of the higher price of electronics and the larger number of electronics in newer cars i am not an insurance expert so i can not comment on the price of car repair accident rate implication the price of human repair accident rate should definitely be impacting the insurance prices humans are expensive af to fix
2094,its not unlikely to come up it will never come up it doesnt come up for human drivers for a reason why should it come up for digital drivers why dont we teach young drivers how to choose who to run over when they face this choice using all of the traction available to stop while staying in the designated lane of travel is not equivalent to killing the person on the track its equivalent to not killing anyone in almost all cases this is why we instead teach young human drivers to watch out slow down in certain situations and hit the brakes if things go sideways cars have a finite amount of traction available to be used between both turning and braking unlike the trolley problem which has infinite traction available for turning and zero tracking available for braking in most cases if a pedestrian steps out in front of you and you have a choice between driving onto the sidewalk and hitting some pedestrians driving into the other lane and hitting some pedestrians or hitting the brakes real hard the correct choice is actually the brakes if the car was traveling at a safe speed which it will be it can stop before it hits the pedestrian especially if it has attention and sub human reaction times you dont code it to weigh the value of each life you just code it to safely avoid the accident if possible and if not possible minimize the impact forces theres no railroad switch because choosing who to kill is a false dichotomy based on imaginary physics

2096,it coming up rarely is besides the point it is a philosophical ethics question sure of the time just driving well is the correct answer so it might be a question that you can avoid answering but that doesnt mean that the question doesnt apply to vehicles just that your answer might result in a few dozen deaths after a few hundred thousand accidents the philosophical question is more relevant to the car than it is to people because like you say people cannot make that type of calculation in the middle of a crash a car can

2098,except you dont need that many drivers on the road to spread the risk even if of people stop driving thats still million cars that need insurance not to mention the fact accident rates for those drivers are likely to go down
2099,if you kill someone due to a dui youll be deported to france after serving a long jail sentence
2100,all level manufacturers will do this theres no other way it could go first of all a no one wants to be liable for something they have no control over killing someone and b someone will definitely do it case in point and so everyone else will have to to compete
2101,its hard to see it ending up any other way at least for fully autonomous cars however when they actually start selling these cars to consumers there are likely to be some catches they havent mentioned yet first if you have a car with a full manual mode ie one where the human is in ultimate control and wont be overridden your obviously not going to be covered by the manufacturer when your in that mode during the transition back to computer driving you also wont be covered for some amount of time to make sure that you didnt put the computer in a situation it cant recover from as a result of your manual control the second major limitation is that there will be strict maintenance requirements possibly even a maintenance contract that you pay in advance and the car will go get itself fixed by an authorized manufacturer approved mechanic likely at a dealership when it decides it needs something fixed even if there is no contract failure to get a problem fixed going to an unapproved mechanic or fixing something yourself may all suspend the manufacturers automatic assumption of liability they may still be liable but they will want the chance to investigate and if necessary disclaim liability it the accident was really the fault of poor repair work unapproved modifications will likewise void coverage
2102,this is a bigger issue than anyone has addressed there are already a lot of problems with faulty accelerator computers in existing cars that have caused many accidents and a lot of recalls but it is extremely expensive to prove that your car made the error not your foot so most lawsuits are not economical its not really clear how liability will be determined when a self driving car is involved especially if one of the drivers claims there was a malfunction
2103,during the transition back to computer driving you also wont be covered for some amount of time to make sure that you didnt put the computer in a situation it cant recover from as a result of your manual control and what if it is the other way and the car puts you in charge in an emergency situation and you dont have the time or the ability to recover the idea of those transitional phases must die before anybody implements it
2104,with the manufacturers covering the insurance the car itself would be cheaper instead the big difference is that a manufacturer can be much more efficient insuring themselves cutting out the insurance companies completely saving billions it also makes things simpler and more convenient to the owners what could happen with liability going to the driver though is that it effectively makes pricing vary a little bit for use patterns someone driving long distances in the city would basically pay more for the higher risk than a lower use customer ideally the difference here should be negligible since neither group should be having many accidents
2105,i really dont see that its a meaningful difference as i understand it i may be wrong there is actually a very meaningful difference essentially when you have insurance you can still be liable for a crash if its not your fault and the other person accepts that its usually somewhat straightforward but that isnt always the case it can be your fault your car may even have killed someone you can even go to prison for it even if you dont you can get dragged through court someone can sue you as the driver of the car because even with insurance you are the defending party what volvo are saying is that they are not just covering the insurance cost in the price of the car but they are actually taking liability for accidents which can save you days or weeks of your life if something goes wrong not just a few dollars that means if your car drives into a person and kills them then volvo will step in and say hey sorry thats our fault well deal with the court case i think theres a pretty meaningful difference there than just having an insurance policy on your car right
2106,i really dont see that its a meaningful difference as i understand it i may be wrong there is actually a very meaningful difference essentially when you have insurance you can still be liable for a crash if its not your fault and the other person accepts that its usually somewhat straightforward but that isnt always the case it can be your fault your car may even have killed someone you can even go to prison for it even if you dont you can get dragged through court someone can sue you as the driver of the car because even with insurance you are the defending party what volvo are saying is that they are not just covering the insurance cost in the price of the car but they are actually taking liability for accidents which can save you days or weeks of your life if something goes wrong not just a few dollars that means if your car drives into a person and kills them then volvo will step in and say hey sorry thats our fault well deal with the court case i think theres a pretty meaningful difference there than just having an insurance policy on your car right

2108,ive been thinking that self driving cars wont kill car mechanics but will usher in an era of highly certified car mechanics i think of airplane mechanics who work on highly reliable parts that peoples lives depend on
2109,remember that insurance would be a lot cheaper with an automated car since of accidents are caused by human error also i assume as a matter of marketing the insurance cost would be broken out from the price of the car so as to not inflate the price so essentially a potential buyer would be able to compare the cost of getting insurance bundled with the car to getting it independently due to the economies of scale the cost of getting it bundled should be cheaper
2110,theyre not going to come to your defence no thats what insurance is for its just a matter of which company has your back i know countless people that have had wrecks none with appropriate insurance have ever suffered any real financial liability i do know some that have suffered criminal liability for doing something stupid but that is affected by who assumes responsibility for insuring the vehicle and lets be honest even if it is you footing the insurance if your car was the one driving if its coming to a lawsuit as opposed to just damages which are routinely handled by insurance its the software and hardware makers theyre going to be going after regardless as theyre the ones with money and unless you did something wrong theyre obviously the ones at fault if such a thing exists its important to remember not every accident has to have somebody at fault bad shit happens sometimes and if you are somehow actually at fault say for not properly maintaining the vehicle then of course theyre going to go after you again whether the vehicle is insured through the manufacturer or not in fact youll probably have the manufacturer after your hide now too look im not saying im opposed to manufacturers self insuring or even that it wont prove to be a somewhat better choice im just saying people get way too worked up about it and its not that big a deal the vehicles will be insured and if end users have to write the check themselves no big deal remember youre paying for it one way or another directly or indirectly there are even advantages to doing it yourself particularly if you have to have insurance for when you self drive anyway you get to shop based on price and service you can choose a plan commensurate with the amount of risk youre willing to accept you can change insurance companies if youre unhappy etc at any rate its not some massive problem thats impossible to solve and will be impossible to solve and cause problems with adoption of sdcs as some people seem to think its a relatively minor procedural decision with multiple reasonable solutions
2111,well i guess we wont have to wait long for the first accident to happen at last an opportunity for me to not dislike tesla having such good press a bad reaction from the media might damage self driving tech adoption by legislators
2112,the trolley problem really only works with trolleys where you have a loooong time to make a decision that really only has two or three options the real world of driving is nothing like this and accidents only occur once you are already fundamentally out of control problem teach self driving car engineers
2113,the trolley problem being applied to sdcs really exists only as a method to get clicks to really bad journalists or to ethicists that havent got much of a real clue what sdcs are trying to actually do every time it comes up they assume that the car has some unlimited set of knowledge about the people involved im sorry but i dont expect cars to have knowledge of what a nun is or to figure out how many babies are in the baby carriage one of the biggest flaws in the way humans drive is that they tend to drive far faster than their perception of their surroundings and their reaction time allow them to react to youre not supposed to drive faster than your ability to see and stop for obstacles but people do that constantly sdcs can see further and can react much faster and for the foreseeable future theyre going to be adhering to driving regulations that allow for humans to be piloting cars alongside them so trolley problems just will not occur and the situations that come closest to them will be dealt with the car bringing itself to a stop or as close to one as possible before any accidents taking the time for the car to figure out how many nuns can dance on the head of their radiator grille is taking time away that could be spent already bringing the car to a stop
2114,youre damn right this supposed dilemma has no relevance to anyone making an sdc in real life youd think anyone who has been driving a car for years without having to make a similar decision would understand this right away but its still every armchair pundits favourite talking point especially if you meet someone socially and you tell them you work on sdcs but this isnt even the trolley problem the original form of the trolley problem is that you have to choose between letting the trolley kill n people but its not your fault or switching tracks so it will kill person but you did it at its heart its a question about acts of commission vs omission blame and liability and its been the core of the auto industrys approach to driver assist for at least the last years probably longer the corresponding dilemma for the auto industry is this say you have a new emergency braking system that prevents some percentage of fatal accidents so if you deployed it in all new cars it would save x lives per year but its not a perfect system so sometimes it might brake or swerve unnecessarily costing y lives per year but the x deaths that happen if you do nothing are not your fault or as the legal system works youre not liable for them whereas the y deaths that might happen would definitely leave the manufacturer liable in a perfect world maybe the choice of whether to ship the system would be whether x y maybe youd take into account some other factors like it would make people drive more recklessly endangering more lives that you hadnt accounted for or the deaths caused by the system are more or less traumatic for drivers that could be an interesting moral discussion but the auto industrys solution to this is that you only ship the system if y theyre quite happy for drivers to kill any number of people with their cars so long as the manufacturer isnt liable the number one phrase used by people who write safety critical software for the legacy auto industry is but what if it makes it crash into a bus full of lawyers children thats why the first aeb systems only started braking after the driver did and its why the idea of robotaxis where theres no driver to shift liability to is so disruptive to the industry its still not very relevant to anyones day to day work as an sdc engineer but the trolley problem well a legalistic reading of it is key to the formation of the sdc industry

2118,i think people do take this scenario literally but i was under the impression it was a thought experiment to consider what are the moral implications of automating these things there must be some situation at some point where the ai takes finds itself in what we would think is a moral quandary even if this isnt it mind you i believe that the drastic reduction in accidents when we take human error off the roads is a fair trade off for some extremely rare scenarios where the ai is somehow at fault
2119,there are definitely situations swerving can work that stopping doesnt at highway speeds it takes the length of a football field to stop even assuming ideal road conditions and a properly maintained vehicle assuming something runs out in front of you its quite possible for it to be possible to swerve but not stop the real reason trolley problems have practically zero real world relevance is theyre exceptionally rare and predicted safety benefits from autonomous vehicles are magnitudes larger even if autonomous vehicles exploded ever time they were faced with a trolley problem and killed everybody within feet it would still be largely irrelevant
2120,yes ive been saying this for years but even subs like this love to talk about prioritizing passenger lives and shit its nonsense sdcs wont be asshole aggressive drivers who over estimate their skill and reaction times
2121,agree that the car making a decision argument is unrealistic it sort of assumes that the programmer is writing code like if baby_in_street break_left_maverick thats not how self driving systems are created the real dilemma is legal if youre at the wheel of a level car and youre at fault in an accident you are liable if youre a passenger in a level car and the car crashes into a sidewalk of people who is liable the owner the front seat passenger the back seat passenger the manufacturer thats a bigger quandary that must be resolved

2124,accidents only occur once you are already fundamentally out of control plenty of accidents occur when someone else is out of control and a machine that can sense all relative velocities almost instantly and can make a proper decision in milliseconds can often avoid interacting with the out of control car with careful calculated in control response
2125,pilot deciding to crash into something instead of a primary school
2126,sure the tech is there and easy enough a person and a car look very different but look at how isps handle controversial content they could easily create blocklists for all of the kiddie porn sites they know about out there they dont why because it creates liability issues for them then they have to explain in court why some sites are blocked but not others the easiest path for them is to do no blocking at all
2127,he crash landed and died

2129,ok so what about this youre doing mph with wheelers on both sides a mother with a child in a stroller is on the shoulder of the highway the mother pushes the stroller in front of your car should the car a hit the stroller b run into the wheels of an wheeler to save the child but kill the occupant c is this a stupid hypothetical case that cant be planned for and is just invented by people who come up with impossible questions for self driving cars to solve which they shouldnt because the chance of it happening is near zero spoiler alert its c
2130,buffett says that one problem self driving cars would have would be determining what to do if a child jumps out in front of the car and another car is heading in the opposite direction do you hit the child or do you hit the other car the first problem i have with that analysis is why do people assume that a human would make a better choice in that situation second the answer is simple you hit the child the child is at fault so there is no reason to endanger either yourself or the people in the other car that you would hit the entire accident would be recorded the child would be declared at fault and no lawsuit would be filed the issue here is that people dont like having to think about making difficult decisions they want to pretend that such things wont happen and when they do they want to have the sudden immediacy of it absolve away the guilt coldly planning out which is the best of bad choices ahead of time is not something people want or like to do however our discomfort is a problem with us not the technology
2131,auto insurance is a free market mostly premiums are based on costs ideally you collect more in premiums than you pay out for accidents if people arent having accidents insurance companies will lower premiums so they can better compete on price the total market shrinks many insurance companies will go out of business the ones that remain will have smaller costs but also smaller revenues
2132,first off there is not a lot of mitigating a head on collision with another car second that option puts more people at risk third other than trying to brake your car is under no obligation to swerve out of the way to avoid the collision in fact if my laymans understanding of the law is correct if you swerve to avoid an accident and hit someone else you are the one at fault even if the person you were avoiding was was initially in the wrong
2133,the reason people are talking about these hypothetical situations is because they will have to be decided before the situation becomes a reality none of the situations you described are unique to sdcs there are already laws governing such actions the only difference is that people are uncomfortable with the consequences of those laws being so clearly demonstrated by being coded into a car if a car does what is legally expected then there is no issue i dont think the situations are as complicated as people make them out to be these cars will have a much greater situation awareness than any human if something unexpected enough happens that causes a crash then you can hardly blame the sdc the cars core logic doesnt have to be any more complicated than swerve if a reasonable open area is available otherwise break so for instance if the car detected a cliff to one side or pedestrians or an oncoming vehicle in its potential escape path it would just break there simply arent a lot of good options if a car swerves into your path a human wouldnt have the reaction time to do anything anyway at least with a sdc you have a chance
2134,interesting i did not know that still it should be a non issue from the link you provided however on appeal the court ruled that the jury should be able to decide whether based on the facts and circumstances of this case and the characteristics of this child ted could be held to have been negligent the child stepping out in front of the car should have automatically caused the car to brake faster than any human could all of which would have been recorded id say that that should be enough mitigating circumstances to avoid fault however this brings up another important point none of this is unique to sdcs the legal system has already developed laws and rules for dealing with these cases presumably these laws and rules are considered the right thing to do in such circumstances and automated cars will be able to carry out that expected behavior better than any human could the only issue i can see is when the law makes a distinction between the correct action based on some criteria that a sdc cant determine for instance if the law was to say that you should crash your car into another car if it was a child in the way but hit the pedestrian if they were an adult then that would cause a problem if the car could not determine the age of the pedestrian im no lawyer but i have a hard time believing such an interpretation of the law would be correct regardless of the childs tort liability there has to be a presumptive defense that a driver doesnt have to endanger their life by getting into a head on crash in order to protect a child
2135,it can anticipate their path great now well have the bluff game where you try to make an sdc crash to avoid you without ever having to set foot on the street
2136,agreed which is why i say the problem isnt with the sdcs making the decision but with humans being explicitly forced to deal with the issues because we have to program the sdcs ahead of time its emotionally easier for us to pretend that such situations dont happen and then write to whole thing off as an unfortunate accident when they do happen it is the premeditation inherit in programming sdcs software that trips people up
2137,other than the issue that utoomuchtodotoday brought up that potentially the law could dictate that you do different things based on the age of the person i think the law states that if you swerve to avoid an accident and end up causing another one then you are at fault therefore the car shouldnt swerve of course i would assume that if the car detects a safe way out of the accident then it would take it as i pointed out in another comment none of these issues are unique to sdcs and already have a body of laws and litigation dictating what the correct course of action should be if a car is programmed to follow those standards then there shouldnt be ant problems the issue is that people have a problem specifically deciding that a specific innocent person should be injured over another ahead of the fact they are much more comfortable with such decisions being made in the heat of the moment by a human being because you can more easily sweep it under the rug as just being an accident thats harder to accept when the decision was made years ahead of time on a computer somewhere
2138,the child doesnt have built in crumple zones and airbags like the other car would i think hitting the other car is the most sensible thing to do the child has no protection and has a significantly higher chance of dying now to turn your posited question on its head replace the child with a deer and think whats the best decision the car needs to recognize what is in front of it and if its as important as a human in one way of thinking of it and then whether to put the human in danger by avoiding the deer and crashing into the car or just killing the deer
2139,the child doesnt have built in crumple zones and airbags like the other car would i think hitting the other car is the most sensible thing to do the child has no protection and has a significantly higher chance of dying now to turn your posited question on its head replace the child with a deer and think whats the best decision the car needs to recognize what is in front of it and if its as important as a human in one way of thinking of it and then whether to put the human in danger by avoiding the deer and crashing into the car or just killing the deer
2140,ive always said that even if self driving cars arent perfect we have to consider the net effect consider the situation where sdcs roll out and save ten thousand lives in the first year but due to bugs in the software they also kill one hundred people people will freak out over the hundred deaths and ignore the thousands of saved lives
2141,minimizing legal liability is what we as a society have decided is the right thing to do you also have to remember the context in which im making these statements buffet said that these types of situations would be a hinderance to sdc adoption im saying they wont because we as a society have already decided what the solution should be these situations are not unique to sdcs in addition simply breaking with a perception and reaction time greater than any human is a perfectly acceptable solution no sdc is going to get in trouble with the law for not swerving into oncoming traffic also no emergency driver assistance system on a car today would even think about swerving and nobody bats an eye if anything would be a hinderance to sdc adoption it would be if people knew that their car was designed to crash into oncoming traffic for the benefit of someone else so i say again the solution is simple the car should break as hard as it can and hit the child there is no legal problem with doing that and that policy isnt going to spook potential ownerspassengers of the car

2143,this google search hlenampampampsourcehpampampampqcarheadoncollisiondiesampampampgbvampampampoqcarheadoncollisiondiesampampampgws_rdsslqcarheadoncollisiondiesampampamphlenampampampgbvampampamptbmnws is all i need to defend my claim that head on collisions are a really bad thing to do also you are forgetting the context of this discussion the argument i am rebutting says that deciding how to code this situation would be so difficult that it would delay the adoption of sdcs the reality is that this is already a settled matter you are in the wrong if you swerve to avoid an accident and cause another this isnt simply a matter of insurance as you state but a matter of following what the law prescribes for you to do the only option that would impede sdc adoption would be to program the cars to swerve into oncoming traffic thus increasing the likelihood of injury to the passengers and the legal liability like i said before nobody gets in trouble for breaking instead of swerving into oncoming traffic that is why it is a no brainer that the correct option in this case is to hit the child
2144,copied response below from another reply ill also add that you arent under any responsibility to injure yourself to help someone else even more importantly you definitely shouldnt injure an innocent third party to protect someone else we wont program these cars to be heros well program them for the minimum legal liability and greatest passenger safety minimizing legal liability is what we as a society have decided is the right thing to do you also have to remember the context in which im making these statements buffet said that these types of situations would be a hinderance to sdc adoption im saying they wont because we as a society have already decided what the solution should be these situations are not unique to sdcs in addition simply breaking with a perception and reaction time greater than any human is a perfectly acceptable solution no sdc is going to get in trouble with the law for not swerving into oncoming traffic also no emergency driver assistance system on a car today would even think about swerving and nobody bats an eye if anything would be a hinderance to sdc adoption it would be if people knew that their car was designed to crash into oncoming traffic for the benefit of someone else so i say again the solution is simple the car should break as hard as it can and hit the child there is no legal problem with doing that and that policy isnt going to spook potential ownerspassengers of the car
2145,how often does a human driver swerve onto a sidewalk on purpose to avoid an accident this seems like such a non issue to me
2146,i fully believe that on the whole sdcs will be far safer than human driven ones i am just acknowledging that there could be some specific cases in which a human would be better thats going to create interesting discussions if out of situations a self driving car is better than humans in of them will people still focus on that other for reasons not to use them after all it will be those that will get all the news coverage no one is going to know about the of accidents that were prevented other than a general reduction in overall incidents
2147,well no its a matter of the law if you swerve into oncoming traffic and cause an accident then you are at fault you have not countered that very simple point you are the only one here offering up nothing but an opinion hey have you at least changed your opinion that head on collisions can be successful mitigated through tech considering that was your main point its very telling that your latest argument totally avoids mentioning it and now relies entirely on pleading moral superiority
2148,and yet my simple google search shows deaths from head on collisions so now you have proven that you cant change your position when presented with new information and are reduced to throwing insults to try to win a discussion for your little morality play would you still swerve into oncoming traffic if you had a baby in your car what if the car youd smash headfirst into had a baby in it oh and since you are so committed to your moral superiority to saving children surely you are donating most of your net income to child charities you could be saving many children right now without having to injure or kill anyone by plowing a car into them
2149,waymo is ahead because google wanted to do this over years ago they have had it on their mind as they build all their other stuff so today google has more data of the physical world than anyone else that they can leverage they know when there is an accident with waze they know when there is a traffic jam they can see the traffic light patterns and when the pattern changes they can see the data where there is a stop sign or even a stop sign has been removed waymo is using a database the cars drive from so if the database indicates a stop sign they stop they do not have to see the stop sign but if the database indicates a stop sign and there is non that they see they create an exception that is logged and the situation is looked into but google can also verify what is happening by using the human driver behavior that they get through google maps and google waze they know if a protest closes a road in real time if a parade they even know how busy a store is at a particular time they know when the stores open and close google has built up their data in prepartion for the data for self driving car robot taxi service and having far better utilization than anyone else but not just the data google has the infrastructure to support you need the ability to handle lots of data coming in make sense of it and get events to cars in real time sound familiar ultimately self driving cars is a software engineering problem google attracts the top engineers in the world so they basically get more first round draft choices than anyone once the cream of the crop comes in and is hire they then can take the cream of the crop of the cream of the crop and send them to waymo google created a virtual california that they can inject diffrent situations this is just vital for doing automated testing i have zero clue how gmforduber and the others are doing this i suspect they just are not why i cant see them getting to a safe solution you are making software and model changes you need to be sure that your change is not breaking something else you need to be able to first do virtual testing there is just so many other factors that favor googlewaymo than just being the only ones that have it working without safety drivers google has b in the bank for example with less than b debt they could buy gm and have plenty left over if they wanted to the piece googlewaymo is missing and nobody has is the car durability data today taxi companies buy regular cars they are not optimized for using as a taxi waymo will now collect data like there has never been before on the cars and that data will drive improvement in durability well beyond cars of today that will enable them to drive down the cost of self driving cars robot taxi service to be cheaper than using your own car within years ultimately waymo will use that data to build cars as it will ultimately be a competitive advantage but they should buy cars until they get the data gathered and then they should buy car making expertise and not do it organically then there is an entirely different angles that google has advantageous that nobody is close at having right now of the top apps used on all smart phones are owned by google enwikipediaorgwikilist_of_most_popular_smartphone_apps gm ford honda combined do not have a single one so there is discovery to summon a car google is unmatched in this area no other company close so you type car into search and a car shows up or you add a calendar event and you get a pop up do you need a car you write an email to get dinner with a friend next week and you both get a pop up do you need a car i saw a stat recently that new email accounts today are more than going to gmail they now have over billion active accounts but it is not only on your phone google in the smart speaker space has moved ahead of amazon even thought getting to the market years later move over amazon echo google home now sits upon the smart speaker throne home most popular speaker so you with google you can just be in your house and say car now and a car shows up gmfordhonda do not have smart speakers honestly never understood how any of this could be debated it is not like it is close now i am someone that does not believe people will be buying self driving cars does not make any sense to me that is people thinking the old world i also do not believe level will happen for decades and possibly not in my life time we have no idea how to do it it will not be as safe as level but there is probably not the financial benefits to spend the billions to do level ultimately it comes down to money we have no idea the processing power that would be required to do level it might be we are a long way from having the silicon to support i think it is far more likely level rolled out like you would roll out cell service area by area with the ones that make you the most money first with self driving cars it will also be driven by government regulation you can get to coverage in probably the next years with level you will then connect city to city so you do phoenix and do tuscon and then you do the highways inbetween eventually you are covering most of the us btw the confusion with level is caused by musk he is way smarter than i and knows better he says things that are simply ridiculous then people believe them the one i find most funny is having the hardware to do level we do not have the algorithms to do level so the idea of having the silicon to support is absurd how can you know that if we do not have algorithms
2150,google has been interested in doing self driving cars for over a couple of decades since day they have done stuff to help them position for the day page has indicated it started with an experience he had at university in michigan or minnesota one of those cold states that starts with an m the other aspect that is critical with maps and waze is that it brings real time data from humans that can be used and even trained from to a certain extent so if all the humans are stopping somewhere and visually it does not make sense for the waymo car you probably should be stopping and definitely being careful but google can see stops signs that humans blow through they get accidents in real time to avoid that is with waze they get real time traffic events or a parade or a protest basically they have many millions of phones giving them the data of humans moving around in real time but they are the only ones with this data but it is not just the data but the infrastructure being able to stream events from so many phones at the same time and able to make sense and run against models and then use to update is actually really hard to do google has been doing it for over a decade and already knows how and has the technology to leverage gm or ford or whoever struggles to create a decent infotainment system ultimately this data is about safety that is why you see waymo having gone over million miles with a single accident their fault which was a fender bender and nobody hurt it is why i just cant see a gm self driving car ever being as safe as a waymo car we can see that gm is having accidents at a much higher rate and gone a tiny number of miles compared to google the motor cyclist that gm hit did live but think it is just a matter of time until they kill someone think gm has gone k miles and waymo over million but then waymo has done over a billion virtually which is critical to have you must do automated testing and situational injection which i do not believe any of the others can do this will be critical for safety

2152,i live and work in the center of where waymo is testing in arizona i havent seen a single car on the road without a safety driver i see a minimum of vans a day im also not convinced that the vans understand how to obey directions from a police officer for example when theres an accident and the police officer is redirecting traffic or when theres a traffic light out k order is a commitment to order not an actual order with a set delivery date from what ive read
2153,really people with a team of have cars driving around without safety drivers if this was true would you get into one of these cars self driving technology is one of the most difficult things humans will solve from a technology standpoint it is so complicated on one hand and then it is literally a matter of life and death on the other that is pretty unique combination it is true launching a space ship into space is life or death but those people signed up for it i am talking innoncent people that did not agree to use sdc could die heck with uber we already had that exact situation with the tesla deaths as far as i am aware it was the tesla owner and not an innocent bystander
2154,we can see disengagement rate we can see how many miles but was just reading today gm had one of their cars crash into another of their cars waymo only has one accident their fault in over million miles there is no shortcuts on how being done gm is several years behind but also has a disadvantage more broadly to compete i suspect gm is actually many more years behind then what they suggest how this is being done by everyone is very manual number of miles matter and variety of the miles waymo has tested all over the us think it is now different states and over different cities on cruise crash hardest thing self driving a cruise on cruise crash reveals the hardest thing about self driving tech edit my bad it is six states that waymo has tested but short changed them in cities tested in over cities that is physical world and more virtually waymo has also gone more than a billion miles in virtual world gm does not have infrastructure like google to do virtual world

2156,they have been training police departments and their cars a couple years ago and recently a booklet surfaced on how to disable and put out a fire for the pacifica vans im wondering about the edge cases for example if theres a fatal accident a police officer may decide to approach a vehicle and tell the driver to drive over the median to turn around i dont have confidence that the vans are capable of taking that direction today and you cannot expect the police to hop into the van to redirect it

2160,guess because i am weird ha never had anyone say that before cruise went k miles in they do not have virtual world so zero virtual it is not about sucking anyones dick as you say it is just what the facts are how both waymo and gm and everyone but tesla is doing this it is a very manual development and miles driven has a linear relationship to where you are at in development obviously variety also plays a roll waymo far more variety and far more miles and so far ahead it is not complicated i am only talking the self driving tech aspect gm is way way more behind when you include all the other things needed for a commercial robot taxi service they do not have the digital infrastructure to support they do not have the human driving data which means cant make safe google knows what intersections people blow through with their google maps data and waze so can be more careful and avoid an accident where gm does not have that data just one example also why you see gm cars crash so much even with going so few miles

2162,i already read that article on le it focused on what happens if the waymo vehicle crashes i just read about the remote control stuff today im impressed but i still would like to see early riders in vans without safety drivers before i am convinced that waymo is light years ahead seems like im not the only one who doesnt believe were as far along as waymo tesla and others say driving ai winter full autonomy waymo tesla uber

2171,people just dont think they or their children will not be in a car crash even simple things are not currently done or enforced in half of all us car fatalities the occupant is not even wearing a seat belt
2172,i did an informal survey of my engineering friends about years ago to a person not one of them would let any of their kids anywhere near an sdc the kids ranged in age from to and included parents of driving teenagers where they admitted their kids were a hazard to themselves and others on the road they tended to worry about really strange rare situations where they admitted that even if they were with the younger kid or if their older kid was driving the outcome was still essentially chance but they would rather they or their kid killed themselves rather than software for younger kids they imagined roving gangs of kidnappers despite being aware of the mind boggling low rate of this occurring now less than per year for older driving age kids they still worried about the kid being kidnapped because the kid couldnt steer the car to safety or something like that for all ages the fact that they were x more likely to result in the death of their kids than an sdc still didnt hold up because while they agreed with the premise statistically they thought that they in particular could have better odds the good news is that none of this matters economics will push people to sdcs and well reap the benefits
2173,while my comment about the time its going to take for introduction is valid your statistics are no less valid and the statistics are interesting one day of delay of widespread introduction of crashless cars whether that day be lost to wrong choices in technology lack of funding bureaucratic wrangling legal debate or whatever it might be years off but it is still a day lost and so lives lost looked at another way there is a financial cost to delays above and beyond the cost in lives the biggest one is the financial cost associated with those lives note this does not imply the former equals the latter but is just one shadow cast by it the dot puts the value of avoiding a fatality at million in the us enwikipediaorgwikivalue_of_lifeunited_states there are about people killed per day that means the cost of delaying is on the order of b per day in the us alone your global number sounds low now but my methods are rough the implication is that investing up to b to get those cars out one day earlier is worthwhile to society for just the us its a big deal when a company drops even b into this research but we should really be dropping hundreds of billions into it just to avoid deaths and without other financial justification

2175,politically this is a good point because it is certainly something everyone is wringing their hands about in reality i think its a bit of a red hearing as accidents havent risen since texting became popular but only fallen that said i would certainly not debate that without the rise of texting maybe accidents would have fallen even further i guess its just my natural aversion to the sky is falling type worriesno offense intended toward you
2176,i didnt just completely make up the trip cost i based it on tony sebas estimates in atlanta where i am it might cost to go all the way across town which ive only done twice in years because its basically across the state but for most cities anywhere should be in the range its all pure speculation at this point but i think its a reasonable hypothetical to move the discussion forward while i think retail like home depot and grocery stores wont be around in years there is no reason to go too far out on the thought experiment limb i dont see why an sdc wouldnt let you haul groceries but assume you have to have a large item from home depot delivered and it cost you which is what it cost to rent a truck from hd for an hour today would you give up one two or all of your cars i agree government could step in and completely kill everything its why we cant have nice things my main hope here is that they will be so behind the curve that they wont add a lot of tax to it until enough people have switched and they will be politically unable to do so the only data point to give me hope is that all the car manufactures are on board and dont seem to be lobbying that i know of to kill sdcs in the cradle i think in general we look at things like iphones and think wow that is and expensive new thing in my life i previously didnt need but i do now what we dont remember is that this thing increases the productivity of the overall economy by thousands of dollars per device sdcs arent even as abstract of cost benifit as a smart phone could sdcs be more expensive that ride sure but there current costs of transit is so large that its hard to imagine how it couldnt save trillions of dollars per year no matter what happens
2177,google could provide some other statistics that would be useful to see how ready for the road their cars are the main one would be how many times say per miles that the driver had to take over and a rough idea of what would have happened if the driver didnt take over eg blocked traffic strike another vehicle strike a person my thought is that if the driver takes over in difficult situations then the accident rate doesnt tell us a lot
2178,the question of whether the rear ending was avoidable is very easy with the set of logs these cards provide remember in only one accident in miles driven autonomously a rear ending was someone injured and it was a very slight injury my guess the cars are stopping gently and reasonably humans are just bad at driving
2179,the rear driver is technically at fault yes but if google is crashing at a higher than expected rate regardless of fault a lot of people would be interested in knowing why this is happening google has yet to provide convincing evidence that their overall crash regardless of fault rate is the same or better than the general publics despite their repeated claims otherwise
2180,when there is no video evidence and its just your word against mine who is the insurance going to side with but it also isnt just inattentiveness it could be speeding following to closely lack of maintenance on their car bad brakestires require a longer stopping distance sometimes you have a scenario on like a highway where a car cuts you off and slams on their brakes to force a collision every accident is different with different circumstances you cant say its always the fault of the person behind
2181,i really want to write a full response but i have to run interesting facts million miles driven million miles autonomous vehicles active milesweek they talk a lot about a baseline but never get specific as to what the baseline crash rate is crashes over million miles is miles per crash thats very close to the miles between crashes for drivers in the us i forget if the latter number is reported crashes or estimated all crashes as google says some of their crashes appear small enough that they ordinarily wouldnt get reported that said googles cars all have trained drivers with clean records who are willing to take over and are paid not to get distracted just with that fact alone they should have a slight advantage over the typical driver which includes teens the elderly drunks etc this does discourage over reliance on google and others self reported crash statistics they had said several times that they were only involved in two crashes theyre also still not giving specifics about which crashes were under human control and which were under computer control they dont have to

2183,i completely misread that title as miles soft accidents
2184,hopefully they can settle a debate for me by reporting that not once ever was there a case where the sdc could have killed one person in order to save others
2185,oh apparently i did the same thing i was like i really hope a soft accident is some technical term that is no big deal cause that sounds like a lot for miles
2186,this topic gets brought up all the time in general its a silly distraction and those sorts of scenarios are incredibly rare iirc one of the google designers finally admitted that if all else in the cars ability to avoid an accident was exhausted and it had to pick one of two things to hit it would choose the smaller one
2187,could we blame a sdc of being involved in fatal accident of instead of deciding to kill a particular one to save the others
2188,could we blame a sdc of being involved in fatal accident of instead of deciding to kill a particular one to save the others
2189,its amazing how common stupid drivers are considering what can happen to themselves and others when they make mistakes i wish i could say we need far far better driving instructors and more difficult tests to earn a license and worse penalties for causing accidents or driving poorly but at this point its too late for that self driving cars now please
2190,sdc technology should be illegal on roads until the technology exists to count how many children are in two school buses so it knows to crash into the one with kids instead of the one with kids and one chimpanzee
2191,say you are on a city street driving mph and someone pulls out of a parking garage right in front of you you would swerve into people crossing the street instead of hitting the other car no one is going to die crashing at mph you might not think it is important but the vast majority of people think quite the opposite of you

2193,iirc one of the google designers finally admitted that if all else in the cars ability to avoid an accident was exhausted and it had to pick one of two things to hit it would choose the smaller one please review that quote from uthatmorrowguy which is what sparked this discussion could you repeat the section between finally admitted and one of two things for me
2194,a good thing this failure to recognize objects never happens with humans it happens all the time everybody acknowledges that sdc need to prove a significantly better driving record than humans before they are accepted after that all these hypothetical who do we choose to die situations are purely stupid because on the whole humans do a shitty job driving and frankly quite often making moral decisions furthermore computers in controlled situations gigaomcommicrosoft says its new computer vision system can outperform humans already recognize objects and persons faster and better than humans mediumcomthe physics arxiv blogthe face recognition algorithm that finally outperforms humans cadbffc again it has to be proven in sdc cars by a safety record
2195,actually its not pedestrians must still show the driver owed them a legal duty of care http injuryfindlawcomcar accidentspedestrian accidents overviewhtml under the circumstances your insurance may always pay out in such circumstances but in terms of your personal legal liability swerving to avoid a collision caused by someone else and running over a pedestrian can be legal
2196,it is machine it will fail there is no machine in existence which has not failed at something and i am not talking here about cars i am talking about machines in general now having people killed because a smartass somewhere thought ill make it hit the smaller object is not an acceptable outcome in any situation human error is far more acceptable than machine error who is at fault when the machine fails

2199,comparing airplane landings with self driving cars is a good imagination exercise in your case planes land on a strip that has no other obstacles they have enough room to maneuver and still the human element is there ready to take charge if the auto pilot screws up and if the auto pilot screw up the human element can decide to abort the landing and try again or can correct the error and proceed with it cars dont have that luxury the manufacturer will be at fault they will defend their case with copious evidence that they were not at fault have you ever heard about plane crashes lets the cases when the pilot is at fault or when the pilot intentionally crashes the plane we are left with a huge number of crashes where they have investigations that conclude in manufacturing errors or computer errors or engine fatiguefailure etc the manufacturer is clearly at fault in those cases yet i have never heard of them having to pay same will happen with the cars some guy somewhere will make a decision write it in software it will kill people it will be deemed acceptable we prosecute humans all the time for manslaughter with cars exactly can you prosecute a computer or in your little delusion being killed by a computer is far more acceptable than being killed by another driver

2202,planes land on a strip that has no other obstacles they have enough room to maneuver flying a plane still has a large number of unpredictable variables wind mechanical failure etc they are programmed to deal with a lot of that or else you wouldnt see it used ill generally agree that cars encounter more but there is also a better out if this go wrong the car can simply be stopped the manufacturer is clearly at fault in those cases yet i have never heard of them having to pay and people still fly imagine that same will happen with the cars some guy somewhere will make a decision write it in software it will kill people it will be deemed acceptable yes i certainly hope so because its still human error it already happens its nothing new you take a chance everytime you go outside all sdc cars have to prove is that by and large they do a better drive driving than humans once that is definitely proven they will be let onto roads they will have lots of evidence to show that
2203,the majority of the accidents are the car getting rear ended perhaps the cars are getting better at city driving and are making less sudden stops because they are confused
2204,it is hard to complain about statistical significance when theres nothing to compare it to we have no idea how many human interventions there have been humans with professional drivers ready to take control at all times would presumably also perform quite well although k miles without accident is not even close to extraordinary when they have driven million miles without accident or any human intervention then maybe they will be ready for preliminary commercial deployment at least as a beta program yes i just made up that number but maybe it is the right order of magnitude what do you think
2205,i mean they have driven well over a million miles without any accidents for which they were at fault with the majority of the accidents being rear ended at stop signslights true we dont know how many times an accident was avoided due to intervention by the safety driver but in those situations they analyze the cars data including what the car would have done if left alone they know if the car would have been in a wreck and if so the engineers address the behavior that would have caused it
2206,university of michigan transportation research institute they put out a report that suggested higher rate of accidents for google cars however there just isnt enough data to come to that conclusion yet
2207,to be fair they do have a higher crash rate just not with statistical certainty and with about a billion qualifiers the report did an ok job explaining the shortcomings of the data the media understandably ignored a lot of that i still blame umtri for email blasting non peer reviewed research to the media
2208,no one dies if you lose to a computer playing go
2209,i find it hard to see where a fully autonomous vehicle would run into a weird situation and need human assistance by all means if the vehicle is involved in a crash etc it would need assistance you will have to give some examples i dont see it the software or hardware would have to fail but that is a fault and the vehicle would need to be taken away for repair and maintenance
2210,g networks have a round trip latency of about milliseconds you can buy hobby kits that allow one to pilot a drone or rc car over a g network over a video feed how safety critical it need be i suppose would depend on the nature of the intervention googles cars seem to get hung up in unusual situations like construction zones accident scenes or even chaotic parking lots places where a remote human operator doesnt need to go very fast at all to navigate the problem
2211,funny i too speak japanese fluently have lived there have worked as a translator and studied programming at a japanese university i dont recognize the picture you paint of japanese people at all
2212,how about instead of simply requiring steering wheels and humans behind them we start thinking about legislation on how to safely remove them that would be acting like a leader in self driving technology and not just as a follower if we wait until the technology is ready then comes the question how do we know its actually ready what tests do we need what proof is convincing shouldnt we start trying to answer those questions before the technology is ready to avoid any unnecessary delay after all human driving kills people there is no lack of incentive in shortening the deployment of full autonomy
2213,only been viewed by all media from a human perspective where it definitely seemed impossible to prevent the accident if a human was driving the car i have to disagree assuming the human could only see what was shown in that video then the human would have been driving way too fast for conditions in actuality though a human could probably see better than that video suggests and so should have been able to avoid the accident in other words i agree that the sdc is at fault but i disagree that a human wouldnt also have been at fault
2214,youre right uber is at fault that doesnt mean sdc tech should be at fault this uber did not have technology that is safe for driving on its own on public roads it had incomplete unfinished technology and uber knows this therefore uber did not and has not deployed this technology thats why they were testing it so they can make it better this accident is due to human error and perhaps poor company practices
2215,this is the big opportunity aviation used to be quite dangerous relatively speaking but the ntsb and the accident investigation of every single plane incident has made flying the safest form of travel in or years self driving cars will be equally as safe
2216,there will always be accidents we cant say a system should never be allowed to make mistakes tesla had a fatality simply because the system could not distinguish a semi truck trailer from the sky at an angle tesla corrected that and moved on there will always be something in the software that needs to be corrected as to why uber isnt accepting responsibility thats because our entire culture is litigious and should they admit fault they open themselves up to crippling lawsuits that could potentially end their autonomous taxi service which since they have actually done nothing worse than any other new technology including their peers would be excessive we really cannot expect every brand new technology to have a perfect fatality free rate and punish every company that fails that by suing them into oblivion but that us the way our current legal and media system works it could even destroy their company so they cant admit fault personally i feel that uber is extending a little far but thats what business does if you arent on the cutting edge then you are being shut out so i at least understand even if i dont agree
2217,look at all these people with opinions anout who is at fault its like nobody has heard about accident reviews or the systems in place to ensure air travel is safe no lets just engage in a witch hunt because everyone loves a good lynching get a grip people
2218,even if the self driving tech failed and the self driving tech is garbage this accidentdeath is still due to human error a self driving system was not responsible for avoiding hitting pedestrians a human was responsible for avoiding hitting pedestrians and they failed to do so this is only more evidence we need to speed up self driving cars one can make an argument that testing an av system still in development with a human responsible for the vehicle is more dangerous than a regular human driven vehicle however data shows the opposite the accident per mile rate of testing avs is a tiny fraction of the human accident per mile rate and even more so when you consider the majority of av testing is in more complex urban environments more complexity less miles
2219,sure but with each crash and failure comes with it opportunity to improve all future self driving cars unlike humans that can only learn one at a time now all self driving cars can look out for this
2220,here vcrwqiue is another video demonstrating the crash site
2221,youre definitely right about this a human would drive slower for such a condition or possibly see better i am unable to rationalize why these factors are not considered and the video is taken as the evidence for the incidentcalling it a hard to avoid accident if ubers systems were using just this data then definitely theyre at fault if not they should submit all data as evidence and enable analysis of want went wrong
2222,assuming the human could only see what was shown in that video then the human would have been driving way too fast for conditions thanks you so many people seem to be saying this was unavoidable but if the dashcam video shows how visible things were at the time of the accident it doesnt the human eye and the cars sensors are much better than that video is the car was driving way too fast
2223,i dont think your point of uber going into oblivion seems correct air accidents were common one day eg enmwikipediaorgwikiair_inter_flight_ but that didnt cause airbus to shut down we are today at a point where we dont have a regulatory body governing safety of self driving cars the creators of the technology should take responsibility rather than trying to get the matter to be forgotten
2224,the only possibility of this happening is if uber allows this to become a chance for leaning and shares this accident data the way self driving race is on its unlikely that this data will ever see light outside uber
2225,i am unable to rationalize why these factors are not considered and the video is taken as the evidence for the incidentcalling it a hard to avoid accident its clear from the video that the woman with the bike was moving well before she entered the lane that the vehicle was driving in at the very least the uber should have observed an object moving into its path and calculated that it was on a collision trajectory and taken some evasive action its clear that the reasonableness test for human drivers isnt sufficient for sdcs we need to increase the threshold but i suspect that legal rationales aside there is pressure from the governors office for the police to find no wrongdoing because ducey does not want the state to be perceived as hostile to sdc testing in any way if the victim were a wealthy attractive woman from scottsdale this would be a very different conversation i doubt that so many people would be rushing to blame the victim in that scenario
2226,this is not true at least not for uber it is true you need to re read what i said and what you said also here is ubers self driving car leader saying that he was pissed that uber did not have the first death around self driving vehicles yea that guy is an asshole and an idiot no doubt so you want the cars to drive faster this one was going mph over the speed limit and killed someone this is wrong the car was going mph under the speed limit in a some places say but thats wrong
2227,the title as submitted is tempe crash was ubers fault period that at the very least implies sole blame
2228,prove it and explain why that means that uber should have run her over when their vehicle and driver both had a large amount of time to see her and change direction so as not to kill her
2229,the sign in the upper right at s just after crossing the lit bridge and before going under the overpass indicates that the speed limit in the crash zone was mph vcrwqiue there have been many conflicting reports and better information would be welcome
2230,i like to think about the positions involved in this scenario a woman lost her life for jaywalking vs uber killing a person because the company was not ready with the technology possibly uber would get away with a slap on the wrist while the woman is no longer alive do you believe that the positions punish both parties equally
2231,i could see the argument if the testing is done on a closed trackcoursefacility but if the testing is done on public roads why would sae levels not apply the important distinction is that for l the car manufacturer is not responsible as you mentioned in this case its kinda moot because the safety driver was an uber employee i wonder if this accident will cause a shift in the industry where everyone fires their safety drivers creates a separate driver staffing company hires their drivers back and puts them back in the cars that way if another accident happens uber can say we are not responsible this was an l car it was being operated by a safety driver and we do not employ him you will have to talk to the staffing company rebu
2232,possibly as far as i know none of the several teams investigating this are even close to finishing correct it takes weeks to fully investigate a crash more if theres a delay in getting the black box the pd shouldnt have released anything at all at first incredibly irresponsible
2233,i wish the article had said waymo has an accident every x miles it would make it easier to have some context
2234,thats not relevant to the accident brake checking is a deliberate act of aggression and what happened here is that waymo mistakely thought it was a good idea to brake
2235,yes and thats what were talking about would the tesla be able to not crash into the abruptly braking waymo
2236,with proper safety distance as long as the tesla wasnt blinded by something else im pretty sure it would have had no issues stopping after all proper safety distance is the distance it takes you to react the distance it takes you to stop with much better response time of the computer compared to humans we should expect a self driving car to stop à few car lengths before the crash
2237,honestly that the car manufacturer is going to be responsible for accidents car manufacturers are going to lobby so unbelievably hard to get that removed otherwise they cant sell cars in the same quantities as they did before that leaves leasing which is expensive and taxi services

2242,if your car crashes youre at fault unless you have someone else to blame the crash on like if someone else drove the car then they are at fault unless they have someone else to blame it on like if the crash only happened because the brakes on the car failed then the brake company is at fault unless they have someone else to blame like if the car owner installed the brakes incorrectly then the owner is at fault unless they have someone to blame like if the installation instructions gave bad directions fault is a very fluid thing a self driving vehicle doesnt add anything unique if a sdc crashes it is the owners problem unless they have someone that they can blame that could be the tire company for faulty tires or the sdc software company for faulty software but now the sdc software only has to perform as well as the promise for them to avoid fault like if you drive a car a billion miles without changing tires and the tires fail causing a crash you cant blame the tire company because you already drove beyond what they promised you when you bought the tires so sdcs are going to be the same you get what is promised if they fuck up what they promised you can sue them and win money if they fuck up stuff they never promised it is your problem the only meaningful question is how much will sdcs promise be that in years or or

2244,yeah i dont know maybe it wouldnt make a difference but replacing the built in software does seem like it would be a big change if you tried to bring something to court if the oems software screws up they can argue that the driver should have been paying attention but the actual glitch is on one entity if you replace the original software pinning the issue on the software company vs the car manufacturer seems a lot more complicated teslas self driving stuff has only been around since and there are a lot of open cases against them about autopilot enabled accidents it seems premature to say that car manufactures never ever under any circumstances have any liability whatsoever for a malfunctioning ads when were only years in to the technology being introduced
