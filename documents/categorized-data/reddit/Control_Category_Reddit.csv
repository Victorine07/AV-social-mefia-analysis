0,unfortunately i think its precisely consumption that will drive this but not at the end user cars in cities level those in the short term will be play things for the people who pay at the upper end of the purchasing spectrum instead i expect the self driving will likely be introduced more mainstream in the shipping industry trucking to drive down supply chain costs and will focus on first mile ports factories plants where the infrastructure can be more controlled to produce less variance for self driving vehicles to deal with its a simpler problem to program around controlled environments then long haul over interstates at least in the us that tend to be more static and predictable this would let them eliminate trucking jobs and avoid the downtime required by humans even if they dropped the max speed theyll probably save on time by allowing them to keep on truckin through the night cities pedestrians passenger commuters and last mile delivery will be the hardest to tackle disclaimer ive been working in a software field tangentially related to this topic which has afforded me the chance to sit in a few conferences on the subject so the above is not really just my prediction but rather what im regurgitating
1,i think its control the ultimate planned obsolescence product an electric self driving car a simple software glitch or update and the battery life falls off want to fix it it only costs the cost of a new car just buy a new car uncle sam loves it because he can finally tell you when you travel and when you dont uh oh you took part in a unapproved anti government protest freedom credits your car no longer functions i have yet to see a single smart bit of technology that actually worked for the person its always control consumption is control technology is not being used to free us its going to enslave us its always a product a service something you dont control on a related note somewhat the more i read into the quality of renewable fuels like ethanol and biodiesel the more oil seems like the biggest scam i have ever seen rockefeller backed temperance movements with millions to wipe out the ethanol industry his biggest competition the modern car is a money sink and it doesnt need to be designed to fall apart and get you to buy another i just want a simple repairable motor vehicle that i can run on homemade ethanol something i can fix it doesnt even need to be fast if i could i would go mph tops
2,i agree im not totally against the idea of a self driving car and i love the type of car service subscription you have described i just think it allows for the introduction of extraneous advertisements and serious drawbacks to the vehicles that might make me hesitant to use them if there was a service the way you described and they utilized it from the get go or even phased it in the way youtube ads have been for example i would be very hesitant to use the service not only is my psyche being manipulated so could my wallet or my waistline everyone is ultimately responsible for their own actions but imagine a lawsuit in which someone wants damages from the car service because it drove them by a mcdonalds every day since they liked it on facebook and their bank account shows a mcdonalds purchase x a week and now they gained a ton of weight and needed surgery it opens a lot of doors for too targeted advertising target and the pregnancy outing with their targeted ad and potential litigation were already bombarded with ads and have to try to use self control in some cases to avoid the impulse purchases to eat healthier etc why would we willingly engage any possible technology or features that could make it even harder to control
3,no like aircraft full control should always be there if something goes wrong
4,what happens if they gain sentience and decide to kill their driver even if that wasnt possible i still wouldnt be comfortable not controlling the vehicle
5,no im not comfortable with the idea of not being in control of the vehicle im driving
6,at some point yes computers are just better than humans at some tasks currently theyre not but they will be and once all cars are autonomous thered be great efficiency gains in terms of traffic much of traffic is caused by human behavior such as braking too hard or lane changing too much which causes ripple effects that caused large slow downs autonomous cars can be connected to a network which controls how each individual car behaves and theyd all drive optimally for the good of all on private roads let people do whatever they want but in public no
7,absolutely not we should never give up the right to control where we go
8,what if i dont like the idea of you being in control of the vehicle youre driving
9,im not an actuary so i dont know the answer to that question theres also the school of thought that believes that a sharp spike sticking out of the steering wheel is a better road safety mechanism than seatbelts so maybe your spike thing should not only be allowed but encouraged
10,loss of autonomy i like having a car where i know i am in complete control of the vehicle
11,its far from complete the key point here is if human input shall always override the computer input then banning non autonomous car will become meaning less and you wont want computer control surpasses manual control eg max crash
12,its not about if an ai can drive better than i can its very likely that ai will eventually reach a point where no human can drive safer than ai its about the comfort i feel of being in control of my own vehicle having the freedom to drive my car at exactly the speed i want on the exact route i want and pulling over at the exact spot i want completely autonomous vehicles would force me to be a backseat driver in my own car which i would hate
13,if your opinion is that i shouldnt be able to drive and control my own car then i dont care about your opinion
14,false dichotomy theres still a human being in control of those vehicles
15,its about the comfort i feel of being in control of my own vehicle having the freedom to drive my car at exactly the speed i want on the exact route i want and pulling over at the exact spot i want completely autonomous vehicles would force me to be a backseat driver in my own car which i would hate what about the comfort of your fellow street users what about my freedom to cross the street without worrying if the car approaching is going to stop at that stop sign or the freedom from being bullied to yield at an intersection when i actually have the right of way
16,yes and ive heard of cruise control that doesnt change my point theres still a human being at the controls who has the power to take over the vehicle you are asking me to give that up and im telling you no
17,ok what about the what about the rights of your fellow street users what about my right to cross the street without worrying if the car approaching is going to stop at that stop sign or the right not to be bullied to yield at an intersection when i actually have the right of way why is that more important than the comfort i feel of being in control of my own vehicle were talking about public safety here not trump t shirts
18,an emergency manual failsafe i would fear that even more imagine a highway full of people who had never driven in their lives immediately required to take control of their vehicles because of a catastrophic failure of a gps satellite
19,by virtue of the technology existing it will take a huge chunk out of that number anyway we dont have to expand government control to police the small minority of people who enjoy driving the old fashioned way
20,a question in response to the question if self driving cars are the future how does it make sense to deploy individual lidar systems in vehicles rather than deploying a ground system that coordinates the self driving vehicles within their zone of control something like that would enable faster optimization or a standard communication systemlanguage which probably faster optimization again can someone explain to a simpleton why there isnt a social or governmental initiative to take control and guide the development of this before it becomes another sales and profit tool
21,those types of techniques can certainly reduce the incidence of false positives but in situations with enough vehicles and specular reflective surfaces your system can easily have very low confidence i used to work with vector templating system that can auto align using lasers and retro reflective material and even with all the tricks we lock out the ability to align two heads at the same time that are too close together these types of visual systems are very sensitive to interference i mean i worked on systems that needed thou accuracy on stationery mounts but i can certainly see a half dozen lidar scanners in very close proximity causing enough interference to atleast lower the confidence enough to make them significantly less reliable not to mention due to the fact that if a company wanted to use visible light lasers for improved range eyesafe and r systems are still incredibly distance limited for dynamically mounted sensors generally use at least other machine vision technology is needed to have adequate active track most of the vehicles that i have seen equipped with lidar systems are also using or other additional methods like machine vision with cameras and actual radar there is a reason we dont see automotive lidar on vehicles outside of experimental self driving applications and close to the ground warehouse autos controlled by a single server or coordinated through a hivemind iot architecture that is also supported by a server teslas decision to forgo lidar altogether didnt happen by accident its far easier to coordinate disparate devices when the scanners you are using arent emitters
22,autonomous vehicles can still operate in the vast majority of the country by area where it would make no sense economically to deploy area level command and control systems autonomous vehicles can operate and improve safety on an individual vehicle level without requiring massive additional infrastructure investment in deployment and ongoing maintenance if a lidar on a vehicle breaks it affects that vehicle if whatever positioning sensor youre deploying at command stations breaks it wrecks the entire area controlled by that station the amount of information required to be collected and transmitted to each vehicle in order to provide overall network optimization is enormous people will definitely not want to participate in a system where their car ends up choosing being commanded in your scenario to sacrifice their own travel time or god forbid safety to improve overall traffic flow against their will these are some of the many reasons why autonomy is the much lower hanging fruit than centralized control
23,infrared ir receptors are rare in insects and have only been found in the small group of so called pyrophilous insects which approach forest fires the impact of infrared radiation in flight control in the australian firebeetle merimna atrata journalsplosorgplosonearticle idjournalpone
24,um nope you are confusing automotive radar used for things like adaptive cruise control or emergency braking that uses radio waves with lidar which is a totally different beast and uses light in fact most autonomous cars have both systems lidar is usually the spinning thing inside the turret on the roof eg on the waymo cars most often from velodyne radars are typically mounted behind the front grille or under the front bumper lidar is basically a laser range finder but it spins degrees and scans also up and down so it creates a three dimensional map of the surroundings automotive radar cant do that it is has nowhere near the resolution for it due to the much longer wavelength compared to the infrared laser btw automotive radar interference with g and such is very unlikely both because of narrow band filtering and also because these millimeter wave signals are extremely directional so the automotive signals following the road surface are not going to hit the cell towers
25,most self driving cars use a combination of lidar and cameras so interference is not much of a problem some existing cars use radar for range finding on their automatic cruise control and automatic crash avoidance there is some potential for interference there if you had two cars of the same model that were almost side by side for example im not sure what if any mechanism they use to avoid that
26,slightly ralated does the radar integrated into newer cars set off radar detectors with so many cars using radar for their adaptive cruise control now it seems like the detectors might be useless unless its a different type of radar or something
27,yes if the cars are sharing data then cars could react to things they cant yet sense going around a corner a lead car or a car coming from another direction could detect an animal in the road and tell the cars behind it to slow down maybe there are changing road conditions like a puddle mudslide ice etc this would not only make other self driving cars safer but it would potentially give human drivers more time to react leading to fewer secondary accidents pileups also as of last year googles car used lidar for small details which has problems in the rain snow so a car might not be able to accurately sense the road conditions until the traction control system tells the car about it which doesnt happen until the tires actually drive over the surface synced cars would make them all safer by giving them more data to base their decisions on
28,good points i work for honda we use millimeter radar for our adaptive cruise control combined with the forward looking camera driving in heavy wet snow the system shut down on me accord hybrid touring with just a small amount of snow covering the radar sensor also if that accord got into a small accident and the radar sensor has to be replaced thatll be about just for the part
29,theoretically nothing except the law just like nothing physically stops a person from buying a gps jammer available on ebay http _fromr_trksidpmltrtrchxgpsjammertrs_nkwgpsjammerghosttext_sacat and placing it near an interstate interchange we do have laws against it you cant just transmit whatever em waves youd like this is federally regulated by the fcc and every country has its own regulatory body for it id imagine sabotaging autonomous vehicles systems will be illegal and probably carry harsh punishments also cars would likely have emergency procedures if a car senses autonomous jammers it would send out a distress signal to nearby cars which causes emergency braking procedures by all the nearby vehicles until drivers can get manual controls or something like that
30,this question is about self driving cars and not adaptive cruise control both self driving cars i have looked at google and mercedes have both camera and radar
31,i imagine people will probably get away with it at first then itll get sorted wouldnt you know the range from the number of cars affected assuming they all log carry cameras and are networked for traffic control in theory everything is scramblable but you want to avoid being caught wouldnt just hacking the system be less risky than actually being on site with a device btw the subject is self driving cars and the central traffic control system they will eventually use not automatic cruise control eg tesla
32,are you an engineer at honda or just an employee i have two questions about their safety features in the touring cr v that i was really curious about but i dont think theyd answer it if i asked someone officially specifically with the adaptive cruise control lane keeping assist system could you basically jump on a straight road hit the cruise and let go and the car will keep you going if nothing interferes the other question was just something i dont have the guts to test will adaptive cruise control stop the car if it approaches a barrier or does it go down to the mph that cruise stops working and just cut out
33,tesla rolled out a fully automatic prototype i believe heard it on rt podcast but assuming the waves used for this echolocation are easily recreatable a homemade device could just be emitting random signals you probably wouldnt be able to easily lock a car signal so the interference would be intermittent that said on a short enough list of frequencies it can cycle quick enough to block out say of what the car can read that means at a stoplight maybe a quarter of those cars get effected and will be recycling frequency if the blocker keeps cycling the only real limit is keeping the signal on long enough to tell the car they cant use it i assume itll ignore a few milliseconds of interference and the odds of collision are also very slim especially since it is required they have manual controls in most cases the mesh network system that will link all cars location can also probably be jammed not cheaply i assume but might make my whole idea moot for all i know i dont know how they plan to pull that off but if its not a satellite link and just lan you can probably mess with that channel too same device several signals now realistically a cheap build you could still probably get several frequencies covered at once that wont be directionally broadcasted without a wide array of points and geometry and even so if you had it in a car or something the likelihood of being mathematically pinpointed as the source is slim and i doubt a detective would find you prosecutable before manufacturers find a workaround you can download to these fancy whips if a manhole was open and letting out hot air nearby pressure changes could change who could be the culprit hacking would require a connection that the car trusts i believe they built the dlc interface to not really do anything except check teslacom for news and updates its pretty locked down and requires approval from the driver forcing a connection installation and hardware control while driving doesnt seem practical finally i know this isnt perfect not really fleshed out im pretty certain this wont actually happen someone with a six figure salary is in charge of that but it is scary to think that a driverless car will allow someone totally asleep to be driving along unable to react if the machine is compromised
34,note that cars have both camera and radar but it is scary to think that a driverless car will allow someone totally asleep to be driving along unable to react if the machine is compromised no different from a rear seat passengfer in a car if the driver has a fit at speed what can said passenger do or a passenger in an aircraft those things dont actually need pilots anymore but the lawyers wont let us get rid of them so we still have manual air traffic control and everytime one crashes its human error theyd be safer uncrewed
35,log the event and upload it to central traffic control and twitter perhaps see what your camera says chances are if the conspiracy is this strong against you you will crash anyway but the world might know about it even if that comes from taking the black box recorder apart
36,for the example of self driving cars even with accidents we can start to prevent these in the future by improving the underlying algorithms at some point if self driving cars take off then were giving more control to algorithms to run a big aspect of our lives however it is quite likely that the total number of accidents gets reduced compared to having human only drivers how do we then approach this ethical dilemma giving up control to a black box black box for most people who dont know whats gone into it and potentially hurting individuals in exchange for improving the lives of people in general i would naively argue its worth convincing society that this is okay because it will save lives but really is it
37,social media companies like facebook have done social experiments that tweak the user experience without public knowledge and also guided their algorithms to make users more ad accessible how can we undo the control they have placed on our lives without deleting our accounts
38,good afternoon profesor there is always a fear that an ai will become self aware to the point where we can no longer control it what step can humanity take once a machine is beyond our control
39,im a self taught software engineer however i have never experimented with ai or machine learning im curious as to why are people so afraid once ai gets intelligent enough they will be able to control us i mean wont the ai be just another program on the computer how could the ai manipulate its own code much less escalate its own privileges and expand on the internet
40,i hear a lot of fear mongering and complaints about algorithms and ai in the press but few solutions i think the problem is solvable we dont want to create excessive algo skepticism some level of caution is warranted but too much fear mongering i do believe we can control how ai will impact us we need a number of checks and balances in place i proposed a bill of rights in my book for the same the main pillars are listed below in response to a later answer transparency audits user control etc also if we are going to reject algo decisions we should ask whats teh alternative humans are highly error prone as well heres what i say in my book i say that the biggest cause for concern in my opinion is not that algorithms have biases humans do too and on average well designed algorithms are less biased but that we are more susceptible to biases in algorithms than in humans because algorithms deployed by large tech platforms like google and facebook instantaneously touch billions of people the scale of their impact exceeds any damage that can be caused by biases introduced by human decision makers meaning that a biased judge might affect the lives of say people but a biased algorithm used to guide sentencing decisions of judges all over the us will affect the lives of several hundred thousands of people so i believe we should raise the bar a bit more for algos than for humans when deploying them in socially critical settings subject them to an audit by a team other than the one that built the ai then deploy them while i say we should raise the bar i am against some fear mongering going on in fact in an article i argued that i would argue that its not acceptable to reject todays ai due to perceived ethical issues why ironically i believe it might be unethical to do so at its core there is a meta ethics issue here how can we advocate halting the deployment of a technology solely because of a small chance of failure when we know that ai technologies harnessed today could definitely save millions of people see more about this viewpoint here dilemmas must not halt the rollout of ai
41,i do believe that agi will happen sooner than most lay people believe but slower than many technologists believe that is to say within the next years in terms of what happens after we have possibilities agi does everything we could come up with and theres no point in us even trying want to cure cancer if feasible agi will beat you to it so we live well as a result agi takes control and acts in ways we hadnt anticipated many people have expressed worries about this personally i belong to neither camp i think we will have many challenges with ai in the next years those ill hopefully result in lots of safeguards being put in place we will likely live in fear that we might lose control but that fear will alone cause many checks and balances to be put in but i do agree with elon musk and many others who were involved in the famous open letter on ai that the concerns are real enwikipediaorgwikiopen_letter_on_artificial_intelligence i am optimistic well do the right things along the way to just about keep it under check
42,recommendations on amzn spotify netflix speech recognition applications like alexa google voice smart replies in gmail spam filtering and email organizing features in gmail outlook auto pilot features in a plane much of the automation eg lane control available in cars today autocomplete suggestions in google search there are lots of other technologies that we might no longer consider as ai but would have been considered so previously in fact theres this famous quote usually attributed to computer scientist john mccarthy as soon as it works no one calls it ai any more
43,important issue discussed in multiple chapters in my book how algorithms ai affect politics i our views are influenced by the media that algorithms on fb google youtube curate for us evidence suggests that they show us more content that confirm our views and lock us into echo chambers which in turn creates social fragmentation this is a huge concern i have written more about it here echo chamber its possible to build algorithms that help diversify our news consumption and there is a lot of effort focused on that today i discuss some of those efforts in my book ii in fb replaced human editors with an algo to curate trending news stories the trending topics algorithm failed to question the credibility of sources and inadvertently promoted fake news the result was that inaccurate and often fabricated stories were widely circulated in the months leading up to the us presidential election according to one estimate the top false stories in that period received greater engagement on facebook than the top legitimate ones iii hypothetical possibilities based on solid research in facebook conducted a study in which they tweaked their newsfeed algorithm to show some users more hard news think more war in iraq and less cats fitting in boxes they then measured how many of these users clicked the i voted button that most of us saw at the top of our facebook feed in november they compared the self reported voter turnout of this group against a control group whose newsfeed algorithm had not been modified the researchers found that users who had their news feed algorithm tweaked increased their voting turnout by three percentage points from for the control group to for the treatment group might not sound like much but the outcomes of elections including the us presidential election in are frequently determined by smaller amounts how politics affects aialgorithms there are already regulators calling for ai regulation in general the left is asking for greater regulation some of these proposals are focused on the use of consumer data by firms for example senator warren has asked for regulation regarding user data sharing the right is overall asking for fewer regulations and then there bipartisan initiatives such as the one by senators klobuchar and kennedy with regard to algorithms and ai there are some proposals as well how the politics plays out and who gets elected will influence how easily firms are able to roll out new ai
44,todays ai tend to excel at narrow specialized tasks and as such were known as artificial narrow intelligence ani or weak ai in contrast artificial general intelligence agi ai with human level intelligence that could be applied to all kinds of tasks also described as strong ai we arent there yet lets assume we get there soon to answer your question projections from many researchers are in the years range if we lose control of strong ai itll be a lot harder one hope is to turn off its energy source but future ai strong ai will know how to procure energy so im going to say that our hope should be that we catch such systems before they go out of control itll be harder after i am assuming you have already seen the concerns raised by elon musk and many others who were involved in the famous open letter on ai the concerns are real enwikipediaorgwikiopen_letter_on_artificial_intelligence i am optimistic well do the right things along the way to just about keep it under check
45,i have a whole chapter in my book where i propose a consumer bill of rights to better protect society in case things go wrong the key pillars in it are i greater transparency regarding data used by algo ii explanations regarding the primary factors driving algo decision iii keep the human in the loop and give them some control iv audit algos by a team that is independent of the team that developed the algo sorry there isnt enough time to dive in but hope that gets you an initial sense more details in my book
46,without any doubt in my mind its a fundamental shift in technology just like internet mobile and cloud computing have been modern ai based algorithms are here to stay advanced algorithms deployed in medical diagnostic systems will save lives advanced algorithms deployed in driverless cars can reduce accidents and fatalities advanced algorithms deployed in finance can lower the fees we all pay to invest our savings but we will have many growing pains along the way driverless car fatalities algorithm bias trading algorithms messing up etc but to discard them now would be like stone age man deciding to reject the use of fire because it can be tricky to control so the question is how do we manage them in the long run
47,they had a control group that was otherwise similar and the only difference was the newsfeed tweak the difference of was statistically significant so it wasnt random difference between groups of course there is the question of whether the tweak made them more likely to click the i voted button or more likely to actually go vote overall i dont doubt that they can influence some of our choices
48,to me it seems less about monitoring and more about complete centralized control of all trains decentralized automatic train safety systems have existed in one form or another for a long time im sure they already had plenty of monitoring because it would be ridiculously cheap to just superglue a smartphone running a nanny app onto every locomotive the thing that bothers me about it is if someone can use a computer to hit the brakes on a train that computer can also make the train go dangerously fast or ignore safety signals
49,im no fan of cars but i do think well be safer with software in control rather than selfish distracted morons
50,oh yeah all the automatic cars running on one single centralized system no stopping no control truly the epitome of freedom
51,ok just hear me out what if we just create a big database or a cloude if you will where all the cars are connected to then we program them all to comunicate with each other always knowing where the other ones are at any moment like some sort of hive mind based on this information we let them make choices how to best avoid traffic violations we probly need to set some rules in place like never hurt a human or cause a situation where a human can be hurt ofc we always want to be able to make sure we can take manual control so they always have to obey us and since they are expensive they shouldent cus harm to themshelfe well as long as they dont break against the first two rules ofc we also throw in some deep ai learning into that so they can get smarter and find better solutions on problems oh and they should be able to share what they learn so they all get smarter faster its bulletproof
52,easy you gotta be plugged to neuralink and let elon take control
53,this is a nightmare those pushing for this type of automation must also be super eager to just be used as a battery in the matrix with zero control over their own body
54,could happen but wont lots of communication and control is necessary
55,overhead walkway but really its not something we need to concern ourselves with anytime soon level self driving cars are decades away and universal adoption would need to be forced by law there will always be people who want to drive the car themselves in fact i expect that when people have experience with these cars that always follow the speed limit and all laws they wont want them we think we can drive better than everyone else as it is well think the same when a computer takes over from us we hate not being in control of a thing we bought and maintain
56,this only works in a simulation because one processor is controlling all movements when you get to seperate processors all trying to communicate and coordinate with constantly changing number of cars coming from different directions then it becomes a lot more chaotic current self driving cars with built in radar have it much easier needing focus on what is in front not what may be barreling down at them from the right or the left
57,i wouldnt wanna be in any of those cars with control
58,you will just be able to run out in the intersection assuming there are no human controlled cars cars with automated driving will not be able to hit pedestrians we will rule the road
59,to be fair most of the time you are likely one bad software bug from death at most points of your entire life at this point a lot of people have no idea how much software controls things at this point thats why redundancies are built and software engineers get paid so much
60,you arent theyll have to build elevated walkways over roadways which to be honest is how it should have been from the very beginning obviously the cost is why they didnt but at no point should pedestrians or cyclists have ever been using or crossing roads meant for cars its stupid its dangerous for everyone involved and hopefully eventually therell be enough of a push for smart traffic control that this will finally happen now obviously the best thing would have been for underground subways to be built everywhere or something like that but public transportation just isnt feasible in a lot of the us for example i invite any doubters to visit a spread out sprawling place like oklahoma and tell me buses trains etc would actually be a viable replacement so the future will probably remain cars
61,yup i will never get in a car that doesnt have manual controls
62,overramps and you dont need a dozen lanes with self driving cars you only need two one going coming and then in city traffic you let the grid control them but pedestrians could have walkways over street level
63,i dont like cars either but pedestrian crossings have existed for a looooong time why would this junction be any different if anything if cars are ai controlled i would expect them to be even more adaptive to pedestrians and always stop when someone steps in the road etc i can see in future that pedestrian crossings might not be necessary although putting failsafes in might be tricky
64,also its easy to control pixels but stop and going a ton build with normal physics thats an entirely different story
65,tesla traffic light free roads to be rolled out nationwide in months years later tesla traffic light free road debuts in las vegas on a mile stretch of road with intersections however design now features the patented tesla speedlighttrade that send a automated ai controlled spectrum devided optical signals to cars when it is safe to cross the intersection
66,they would rather spiral out of control in an instant rather be inconvenienced a little
67,lol how is it there in my country getting a license is more hard than finishing school lmao and also costs a couple thousand to even attempt you need like hours of driving with a professional tutor whos in the car with you and teaches you everything and the final test is like h of straight driving with multiple challenges like parking emergency breaking explaining how a car works and so on you eg cannot get a parent to teach you driving thats highly illegal its hard af and almost everyone fails at first but im glad its this way i dont want idiots controlling a ton metal box
68,dont base your knowledge of control systems on your windows pc ive worked on industrial control systems and ive seen ones where the status shows theyve been operating non stop for over a decade without a failure or reboot
69,a hsve nearly been killed several times as a pedestrian controlled intersection walk sign and some idiot turning right or left into me
70,the engines themselves are an issue small gas engines for landscaping leaf blowers line trimmers chainsaws mowers account for a significant amount of air pollution because they have no emissions controls and are often stroke motors to save weight california is mandating that they be phased out by
71,ai managed traffic and regenerative braking or we could just have trains also what youre describing isnt even ai its just computer control which is how most metros work also has been experimented with cars ai specifically is using a machine learning model to drive a car which could incorporate car to car communication and smart traffic management like youre describing or we could just have trains which are still much much much much much more efficient and safer and faster
72,you consider this ai enwikipediaorgwikicommunications based_train_control any programmed command control system is ai then traffic lights are ai what city or suburb doesnt have computer controlled traffic signals at this point is that ai and thanks for the condescension i may not work in it but i have plenty of friends who do aiml including one mit phd who has worked for llnl doing it who i have also had a lot of talk with what ai based autonomous vehicle system under development doesnt use machine learning machine vision etc
73,cars are seriously so dangerous i hate driving i cant control what other people are or arent doing im fortunate enough to work from home now but at my previous job there were several blind turns in the city where i literally took my life into my hands every single day i didnt know that car hating was a thing and im glad im not the only one
74,no just reduce local control over zoning in high demand areas and let the market take over also most of us live in the suburbs thats why we hate them
75,driving can be a fun activity but your hobby should not be enforced on everyone else to partake in especially when it causes many problems instead driving for sport or fun should take place in a controlled safe environment like a racetrack with people who enjoy the sport all around you im also not sure how you can like being stuck in traffic most days and find that fun maybe you arent usually stuck in traffic but for the majority of people driving in most places in the world that is the reality and it is not fun your experience of public transit was poor and that is one thing this subreddit is against we advocate for safer reliable frequent and fast public transit so that your commute of minutes could get down to or maybe even less in many places around the world public transit is the fastes option you also complain about the cleanliness of public transit and that could also be fixed you just need to help by advocating for more funding towards your local public transit system
76,a few months ago near where i live an suv going kmh legal limit is kmh on a highway lost control hit a cyclist drove over the divider and crashed into an oncoming small car before stopping the cyclist and the driver of the small car died on the spot while all of the suv occupants survived with minor injuries almost no one really understands the risk you are taking everytime you get into a car almost no one really understands the risk everyone else is taking everytime you get into a car
77,i got a newer one thats got all the emissions control on it i had a eco boost ford before hand but found it was costly to maintain biggest gripe was the tires like majority of it is just wasted like maybe of it is ever used and its a shame
78,oh i know i watched a guy on ride without a helmet he was going too fast lost control and hit his head on the divider wall i didnt stop to check because i knew he wasnt alive and i didnt want to scar myself
79,see i enjoy distance driving blasting down an open stretch of road hundreds of miles from anywhere familiar to me is such a sense of freedom spotting cool places to stop and check out is incredible and it helps that i have a pretty light pretty low reasonably well handling sort of peppy for an inline while still getting over mpg fun slow car one so normal that regular car reviews did a very regular review of it but traffic blows city driving blows and driving familiar routes blows except for that one corner that you can take a little too fast and feel the weight transfer through the car and know that youre still fully in control while feeling some very fun forces that remind you of childhood at the local go kart track where they put lawnmower engines into a fiberglass body with bumpers all around i desperately want a track car something i can take to a nearby circuit on club days maybe a first generation miata or a neon maybe a civic maybe an old bimmer series maybe an mr or gti but for now my wagon and public roads will have to suffice
80,last time i took the non divided bike path to work i counted the places where there was evidence someone had driven onto the path in a mile stretch i found places where the vehicle had majorly gouged the grass divider and damaged the chain link fence on the far side of the path they ran over the bike path with enough speed and lack of control to cross all the way over it and hit the fence on the other side less obvious are all the fiberglass divider flags that have been snapped or cracked at the base by contact with vehicles admittedly many of them could have been damaged by snowplough trucks but its still concerning its like the difference between a wooden fence with a beware of dog sign and a wooden fence with a beware of dog sign that also has holes chewed through every rd plank
81,maybe more free will reasons cause actions i act freely because my action was entirely caused by my reasons to act that way lets think through some of the ways this gets spelled out do i have free will if someone is controlling me with a mind control ray no because my actions arent being caused by my reasons do i have free will if i do something i have independent reason to do while controlled by the mind control ray no because the reasons that caused the action werent mine do i have free will if i do something for reasons that i know i have even if those reasons feel like things i have no choice over yes because the reasons are mine this last one is maybe worth a bit of discussion because it one of the reasons why i didnt put the word choice in the original formulation edit i realise i didnt use choice at the top here but i did in the previous post the previous post was me being incautious with language because i didnt realise it would come up
82,im mostly just waiting for the mods to find us as off topic but if you dont tell i wont tell otherwise happy to help because im pretty rusty myself lessee im going to make some assumptions so please dont take it as a comment if i go over something you already get because hopefully itll help us find where things are sticking also feel free to skip anything you dont need im not checking homework free will vs determinism compatibilist theories of free will are contrasted with strange i know incompatibilist theories of free will incompatibilists say that free will is incompatible with determinism about the material world so thats the big context of the debate how do you reconcile free will and determinism what is determinism determinism is the idea that physical processes are fully caused ie if you know all the preceding steps you can predict the next step think laplaces daemon if youve heard of the thought experiment what is free will one rough way to conceive of free will is whats known as libertarian free will which sums up as a kind of could have done otherwise imagine if you could rewind back from a decision free will is ability after rewinding a choice to make a different one why do incompatibilists disagree incompatibilists say that either free will or determinism is true theyre incompatible with each other if i rewound my decisions i couldnt choose to do different because every choice is determined ie caused by a previous brain state leading to positions free will is an illusion or determinism is false compatibilists compatibilists think both those groups are being overly hasty dennetts phrase free will worth having is a good way to sum it up they take the view that incompatibilists have misunderstood their terms and once you fix that misunderstanding there isnt a conflict for the record i have no idea if there are a different bunch of compatibilists who think determinism can be made compatible with traditional conceptions of free will probably are though it might be interesting to see how youd do that reasons as casuses the key insight for compatibilists like me in the dennett vein there are others but im no expert is that reasons are causal entities the door was causing a draft is a reason because it causes me to close my door free will worth having dennetts point is that once you have that insight you realise that actually peoples intuitions are that they are at their most free when their actions are fully determined when they are completely caused by reasons a my reason for closing the door is that it was causing a draft my action closing the door is fully determined by my reason it was causing a draft contrast b i dont know why i closed the door were immediately suspicious somethings gone wrong with my agency c i had no reason to close the door similar thing but now youre trying to say that someone else probably did it and the final charge is that free will worth having is when every action i take is in fact causally determined only not by abstract brain states but the reasons i have for taking that action xb appendix housekeeping the previous post the previous examples are teasing out different ways you might use the dennettian causal story do i have free will if someone is controlling me with a mind control ray no because my actions arent being caused by my reasons theyre being caused by whatever the properties of the mind control ray are this is just a straightforward negative case a version of i dont know why i closed the door where we get suspicious about whether someone had free will at the time in this case they just dont do i have free will if i do something i have independent reason to do while controlled by the mind control ray no because the reasons that caused the action werent mine this is to deal with cases where say someone mind controls me to force me to exercise yes i had a pretty damn good reason to exercise but as my reason didnt cause the action i wasnt free this is also the legitimately debateable question about whether paternalism inhibits freedom or simply expresses it do i have free will if i do something for reasons that i know i have even if those reasons feel like things i have no choice over yes because the reasons are mine this is the case of straightforward yes but it also highlights a bigger questions about whether we ever actually choose the things we believe i didnt choose to think cars are an insane way to travel in a city i was forced into that belief by every interaction i have with them and my experience of the roadscape with them on it i honestly cant say that i could choose to think otherwise i dont have libertarian free will on this question but i dont think theres anything wrong with that and given the forum here i think youre pretty much in the same boat hopefully you find that all useful though if you dont it might be useful reading some dennett or listening to one of his many videos on it
83,also entertaining media will adapt that tesla control screen
84,what about safety it will be interesting to see how well self driving cars can compete with airlines in this respect air travel is currently much safer than car travel and i doubt self driving cars will be hugely better than conventional cars cars have the advantage that accidents kill way fewer people per incident than aircraft and that could help perceptions but self driving cars share with aircraft the feeling of not being in control which people dislike
85,i know im in the minority but i seriously dislike all the automated features on vehicles these days they only make the driver more complacent one reason i like my motorcycles is that im actually operating them i have to be alert to what im doing and also what everyone else is doing i want to be in complete control of the death machine i know i am going to meet my end by having one of those automated vehicles screw up with the driver not paying attention and kill me thats what happens when people get lazy and rely fully on technology especially a young just emerging technology
86,people cant keep their phones secured but they want to ride in driverless cars controlled by computers there will be deaths from people hacking into peoples cars while they are drivingpay this much or i crash your car
87,or allow driver less car to board high speed rail hyper loop the beluga air liner in a comprehensive travel network monitored and controlled through rfid passport scanners its not going to kill air liners they have to adapt their business model
88,it would be nice but your are never going to have completely driverless cars regardless of the technology too many vested interests against you will always have to be able to take control
89,now imagine the government and corporations having full control over where youre allowed to drive
90,except that it is hugely impractical and dangerous xb autopilots can work in the air or even at sea since there is lots of room and little chance for encountering the unexpected they could work well on tracks where forward back and stop are the only three possible commands but roads are a different matter entirely kids chase balls into streets animals leap across freeways potholes develop where they shouldnt garbage and debris fall off trucks the world is vast and there is simply no way to create a program that can properly anticipate every hazard properly no programmer or team of programmers is going to be able to anticipate every possible road hazard xb one example i use is this imagine youre driving downhill on a mountain pass youre in a standard small sh sedan there is a semi truck behind you loaded down to the gills riding its brakes and downshifting to attempt to slow down on the steep downgrade suddenly a deer jumps in front of your car what happens a smart person guns it and bounces the damn deer off the hood and accepts that hes going to take some damage doing so a fool or a computer with a forward facing proximity sensor brakes and the truck then crushes you to death because it physically cannot stop in time no matter what xb humans are stupid and often make mistakes but at least when a human driver or pilot screws up there is someone to blame a human can also choose lessser of two evils scenarios when driving a computer cannot weigh the moral difference between swerving into an oncomming car or running over a child in the road self driving vehicles are really only viable in known controlled environments otherwise youre literally putting your life and the lives of those around you in the hands of some programmer who has had way too much mt dew way too little sleep and has never seen the terrain you drive in
91,except that people have zero tolerance for an automated car causing accidents so we have laws that say people must always be in control of the car
92,also you have more control over the trip can take as many rest breaks as you want hell make changes on the fly moreover with good cellular network reception or an account with starlink you can even work and play while the car is driving itself i can see a business in renting self driving large doubledeckers that can serve multiple passengers with shower rooms and shared kitchen
93,most cats are already self driving they really hate when people take manual control
94,no you yell at the person who is not controlling their kid
95,i still want to drive my own car its my one thing in life i can actually control
96,and whos responsible in a car accident if all the vehicles are autonomous eg without any human in control at that moment thats some good legal question imo
97,how do auto cars handle pot holes i have lane departure steering assist on in my ride and every morning i have to fight against the car taking the steering wheel as i avoid potholes
98,i dont like riding on ski lifts because i am not in control
99,idk but i feel like when im driving if i die has a lot to do with how aware i am and other factors i can control a self driving car removes that from me i feel like i havent been in an accident because i am vigilant and take care not to
100,lets exclude for a second the test case where a manual driving death occurs due to something out of their control assuming self driving is enforced by law in the future why is it okay to make this tradeoff s vs s for a driver that does not make mistakes while driving but dies due to a fault in software in a self driving car
101,i think its more about not being in control thats what bothers me about flying also something about placing your life in the hands of others or ai just doesnt sit well with meeven if it is technically safer
102,remember when the automobile represented freedom auto comes from an ancient greek word meaning self its an extension of the pioneering individual and autonomous spirit you could take that car out on the open road and your destination is whatever you want theres noone to tell you cant go theres nothing that can stop you self driving cars represent the antithesis of freedom but a system of control and security
103,we may get self driving cars but be careful what you wish for the form in which we get this will not be a car that you can jump into at any time and go anywhere you want simply by talking to it instead it will be a car that is regulated by a central traffic control authority all use of it will be regulated including speed distance and when it can be used the automobile ushered in an era of personal freedom for americans and the rest of the world the self driving car will end that era except for those rebels that hold on to a car they drive themselves that is not connected to the internet
104,yeah but you cant make something as inherently dangerous as being in a car on the road completely safe without making it so insanely expensive and impractical that it defeats the purpose and youll never eliminate all possible risk theres always freak occurrences and far too many variables anyway we already accept far greater risk when we get into a thinly plated metal cage weighing half a tonne or more traveling at kmhr on a narrow road in the opposite direction to other complete strangers doing the same thing with only human reflexes and just hope they arent drunk or mildly distracted and dont turn the wheel slightly and kill you both its interesting that we worry about other people having guns but well happily get on the road or cross a street and trust people not to point their weapons at at us and press the controlled explosion powered go button
105,yes but we need someone to blame if theres someone controlling the car we can blame them if an auto car murders who is to be blamed
106,the difference is that with time machine error will continue to drop as more and more advances are made to the technology used whereas people seem to only cause more and more accidents as time goes by acceptance of self drivings cars is the first step to automating transportation for everyone machines will cause less and less accidents because of uncontrollable variableshumans affecting the environment in which they operate
107,i dont want to give up my control to a computer thanks and frankly i think youre out of your mind if you do i mean right out
108,this is absolutely nothing new here we trust our lives to automated and other machines each and every day elevators escalators industrial equipment boilers gas lines traffic control systems the list goes on and on every single person encounters at least one machine that could quite easily kill them every single day with nobody at the wheel of these machines why we cant get our heads around this one is perplexing and its not even like we are even very good at avoiding killing ourselves with the current manned machines we are better at killing our selves with cars than the ai is right now forget even in years when the technology continues to improve
109,nope sorry not gonna have an ai drive me around and cause a fatal accident i could have prevented and i need my control when i have to dodge other equally safe self driving cars that are on the road ever consider how easy it is for your death to be blamed on a system malfunction on a fast speed highway aaaand yah im never giving up being able to control my vehicle thanks tho xd
110,so killing people with cars accidentally is immoral but killing them with logic and science is totally awesome because progress i gotta say in the industry im in if i killed anyone including an animal which other people in my industry have designed and built things that killed children i would be shut down and rightfully so i dont think its a good sales pitch for me to go to a customer and say that the use of my new product i designed will certainly lead to a couple of deaths but it will be less deaths than the product i built last time because with this technology you have no control over it we are definitely getting dumber
111,nah you can say that about most anything milaria may kill millions but think of all the billions of children that would have died had they been born all i hear from him is give us control go fuck yourself toyota
112,yes like people want self driving cars while at the same time regretting the control given up in so many digital aspects of life but then they see a new cool toy and forget all their previous regrets
113,id like to be in control of my car
114,yeah but the plane has people sitting behind the controls who have well over combined flight hours thousands of hours of study and training along with college degrees who follow rigorous procedures and checklists not jim who plays on his cell phone thinking his car is fully autonomous
115,yes but all planes are talking to or more control rooms and know where all other planes are and possible obstacles unfortunately we cannot have the same guarantee with self driving cars as obstacles can appear from anywhere eg bicycle rider makes a turn without looking effectively best solution is gps everyone but then theres the issues of privacy etc
116,to everyone in this comment string trying to make the point that flying a plane is easier for automated control youre right it is easier and yetwe still require pilots why would you expect to have manual oversight of self driving cars go away any time in the near future thats at least a decade or two and probably more after we have a system capable of doing so safely with human oversight its the same thing that happened when elevators went automatic the automatic push button elevator was invented in but it took years to get rid of the operators when driverless elevators drew skepticism
117,on senors is anybody worried about people not maintaining their cars how many have driven around with a check engine light on now imagine people driving around with an intermittent sensor will people pay for repairs immediately or try to coast by will people possibly buy a car they cant afford to maintain and end up with a hazard to the public on the road or will we have to maintain our cars to the highest standards complete with maintenance logbooks day checks etc edit you guys have some great ideas but its not fool proof edit isnt the goal of self driving cars to not have humans drive ever or allow a car to drive an impaired person home sensors dont fail after a drive they can fail at anytime some sensors will fail intermittently or it will pass the bit built in test but display inaccurate information or lets say it fails reverts to manual control and the human being onboard is drunk edit i am a pilot and our airliners have lots of redundancy but systems and sensors still fail and its up to the human to sort them out if pulling over isnt an option which it isnt in an aircraft this is despite having highly regulated and mandatory maintenance ive had airspeed very important become unreliable loss of trim position indication think car doesnt know steering angle generator failures power distribution issues in which a bank of systems fail autopilot and autothrottle failures etc all of these passed their bits before going flying im just providing some food for thought i dont hate the idea of self driving cars but to say automation is always better than a human i dont think tells the whole story
118,do you know how many microchip and processor are already controlling most car
119,hello tesla called theyre wondering how often their mostly software based vehicles malfunctioned and killed people also ford called and asked if their steering wheels are still attatched the to the car
120,its proven that you as a human being suck at it control that is
121,they also have controllers and all speak the same language over live radio chat without calling people racist slurs along with stricter rules and licenses apples and oranges
122,this article referers to a report from the cdc center for disease control which highlights the fact that there are many more defensive uses of firearms than offensive per year in the us lives that otherwise might have been taken remember that lives taken by firearm also usually includes suicides and its suggested that the majority of gun crime is gang related typically black on black rareusrare politicsissuesguns rare politicsthe cdcs latest report on firearms might not make many gun control activists happy
123,actually because of the technology built into these cars they could be controlled by a central traffic authority everything about them could be controlled including speed when and were they could be driven and how often there could even be a licensing system set up for how often people want to use the cars want access thats a really high license fee limited use like back and forth to work would cost less however spontaneous shopping trips would be limited all of this could be justified in terms of keep traffic flowing at a steady but safe pace fuel economy environmental concerns safety and other social concerns the era of jumping in your car and going where you want and when you want will be over i dont say i like it but the temptation to eliminate all the bad things associated with cars controlled by individuals will too great for those in charge to resist my advice keep a big block chevelle hidden in your garage
124,exactly hit the brake controlled stop no choices anyone who is hit will probably be illegally crossing the road anyways and the car companies arent liable for other peoples high levels of stupid as long as they follow the traffic laws
125,you pick the option which will statistically result in the least number of deaths over time taking you at your word would require fatesome sort of precognitive computer and mean scenarios like in this one story i read where a self driving car kills a guy cant remember if he was passenger or pedestrian because through some means i cant remember like ai connectednesseyes and ears everywhere the ai controlling the car somehow knew the guy would have killed his wife had it let him live to get home
126,there is little reason cars should not be in communication with each other like an ad hoc mesh atc network we just need to reach critical mass of ai driven cars the cars who are linked can share data about pedestrians road hazards and non controlled vehicles on the road the software to accomplish that is straightforward but nontrivial to implement even standard driver controlled vehicles could contribute camera data and benefit from a digital model of the road ahead for example to see hazards over the hill or around the curve ahead through a hud system
127,yeah i think the odds are much better of not having such an accident and also surviving it should it happen if the machine is in control
128,self driving cars will really completely change how we deal with car insurance what might end up happening is people buy insurance for their autonomous car and if an accident does happen insurance pays for it and life goes on nobody is charged more since the risk of that particular car getting into another accident is not increased it stayed the same relative to every other autonomous car on the road that particular cars risk of getting into another accident has not changed since every car would ideally have the same programming were still thinking of insurance in terms of who to blame in an accident but when autonomous cars come around they arent going to be making the same mistakes as human drivers if an accident does happen its almost of the time going to be due to something out of the control of any one car the simplest way to handle insuring a vehicle that simply cannot have at fault accidents is just to pay a flat rate and when an accident does happen insurance pays for the damages for that particular car and moves on if there were multiple vehicles involved each vehicles insurance will pay for the damage on their particular vehicle now if an accident does happen that is at the fault of the cars programming that should be up to the software developer to deal with if a glitch in the cars programming causes the accident that developer is responsible for their own software if an accident occurred due to a poorly maintained vehicle that is the responsibility of the vehicles owner to deal with in that case their insurance provider could decide to raise their premiums because they have proven that they dont maintain their vehicle or they could require regular inspections or something like that
129,i could see a legal and controlled lane change if it can avoid collision the car would know whether the adjacent lane is clear and how quickly it can safely make the lane change without losing control or rolling otherwise brakes it is none of this jumping onto the sidewalk business
130,i would counter that your life is frequently in the hands of many other drivers outside of your control and that replacing human drivers with ai will reduce the number of threats to your life increasing your security also i imagine you could just switch to manual mode if youre in a situation that requires it youd still be in the driver seat with really really good cruise control
131,i could see it making a controlled lane change if the path is actually clear thus avoiding all collision but yeah some of these situations are just ridiculous if nothing else the car should behave predictably braking is a predictable action when presented with an obstacle
132,completely wrong even human drivers dont just brake at least the good ones there are plenty of very common situations where its too late to avoid a collision by braking but its still possible to avoid it by swerving into the open lane next to you in fact swerving to avoid a squirrel in the road and thereby losing control of the car so common that its practically a cliche is a variant of a trolley car problem right
133,i mean thats just a lease with a really smart autonomous vehicle not got an issue with it but its something i and i think most people who currently own cars would want full control over for instance i dont mind my car driving home and parking theres then coming to get me from work if its my choice and parking is a stretch but i dont want my car ubering other people around thats why its my car so i can leave shit in it
134,youre reading the words and missing the point if it swerves its going to be a controlled swerve the same kind recommended in driving courses its never going to jump a curb onto a side walk or drive headfirst into oncoming traffic to avoid someone who steps into the road if people illegally walk into the road and there is person on the side and oncoming car with no one even in it the car will brake and hopefully only kill a few of the people who broke the law
135,act of god is legally established to describe natural events that are out of your control in both the act and prevention on an individual scale a single individual did not cause the hurricane or the tree to fall within reason where the tree did not pose any threat of falling before so these are easily put towards acts of god i can imagine it would be almost impossible to apply this to self driving cars these cars must be programmed and designed by humans to behave the way they do so the decisions they make can easily be explained to lie on someones shoulders this is reinforced if we have self driving cars that can be overridden to be manually controlled and then the blame shifts from the company to the passenger inside
136,i think all autonomous vehicles must be hard wired to remain on the road at all times where it knows the conditions and where third parties expect it to be consider instead if a vehicle had air bags mounted on the front then it can just catch the pedestrian and stop in a completely controlled manner whilst notifying the vehicles behind it really there is no reason why a self driving car has to be just a car without a driver a heavy rigid chassis metal shell glass openings etc this form of vehicle may be redundant when the primary operational functions to be driven and not be stolen become defunct we may see a whole new class of vehicle which no longer follows the traditional design priorities and contemporary styling although the constraints of the existing infrastructure will dictate some aspects such as width height and turning radius the rest is fairly open to innovation i can imagine long haul road trains with bedroom cabins and a dining cart or perhaps an amphibious vehicle that can park in the river and survive a flood it could get very interesting if the market stays open
137,whaaat my dad and i drove to san diego from la in his tesla and it kept telling him to push the steering wheel buttons every so often in autopilot eventually my dad just stopped paying attention and the car stopped autopilot until we reached our destination
138,not sure whats worsesleeping dude with a car sort of in control or dude filming with one hand on the wheel constantly looking next to him to make sure the cardriver is in frame
139,we lost a few people when they invented cruise control and were gonna lose a few more now let the chips fall where they may
140,doesnt it require you to make contact with the steering wheel or something in intervals to prevent this
141,if his little thing tied around that steering wheel fell off and he was still sleeping he would have slammed into somebody going miles per hour miladinovich said not true if autopilot detects that youre not gripping the wheel and you continuously ignore or arent awake to notice all of its warnings it will put your hazards on and gradually slow to a stop still not the safest situation on a freeway but its not like it just shuts autopilot off and lets you just drift until you crash ironically the thing falling off might have been the best thing that could happen since the warnings could have woken him up
142,doesnt it require you to grab the steering wheel like every few minutes
143,if his little thing tied around that steering wheel fell off and he was still sleeping he would have slammed into somebody going miles per hour miladinovich said thats not true at all the vehicle will start with audible alarms and will slow down and come to a complete stop if it does not get sufficient user input over a period of time there was actually another story recently where the cops got in front of a car and slowed down to make the tesla stop while the driver was asleep at the wheel but i guess the story will not be sensational enough without that possibility of danger to the public
144,the same thing happened when cruise control became mainstream morons would turn cruise control on and go take a nap in the back seat expecting the car to take care of itself this isnt oh my god a tesla crashed this is moron fell asleep behind the wheel
145,i see these comments and cant help but think this is why people become anti tesla you and your steering wheel dongle should have your own separate road we shall call it the tesla derby freeway
146,im not sure how i could use this tech without being distractedor just reallllly bored like i often dont use cruise control just to stay more engaged id rather have a fully self driving car or a fully manual drive car with safety overrides from stuff sure
147,even if we had level whatever self driving cars i wouldnt really trust the system unless fully automated without direct human influence for example a driver steering the vehicle in anyway control functions like with trains excepted
148,i call bullshit ive owned two teslas and the frequency that it requires you to physically touch and slightly turn the wheel to keep auto pilot engaged is about every seconds to a minute otherwise it will disengage and your left with only adaptive cruise control
149,i thought there was something on the steering wheel that you have to press every two minutes to confirm youre awake this feels like marketing and not news sponsored content
150,our insurance agent retired and we sat down with the new one this conversation got brought up she had come back from a seminar where this was covered and she said the insurance industry doesnt see autonomous vehicles without a driver coming for at least years and likely longer and for auto drive vehicles right now one of the hard standing points right now is that a driver must be present and be able to take the controls so no lack of steering wheel vehicles either no sleeping and no inebriation
151,our insurance agent retired and we sat down with the new one this conversation got brought up she had come back from a seminar where this was covered and she said the insurance industry doesnt see autonomous vehicles without a driver coming for at least years and likely longer and for auto drive vehicles right now one of the hard standing points right now is that a driver must be present and be able to take the controls so no lack of steering wheel vehicles either no sleeping and no inebriation
152,this article is nonsense the autopilot system turns off and stops the car if you dont apply pressure to the wheel also he never would have slammed into anyone because the cruise control is adaptive
153,i will never rely on a computer to control a vehicle moving at mph its a computer it can be hacked its been proven already too many people rely on computers if the world died no power or internet it would take less than hrs for half the world to die off and leave the smart ones to thrive
154,as someone who felt sleepy after getting a car with just vanilla cruise control for the first time its easy to see how disengaging completely is likely to lead to people nodding off
155,anyone read the long run and the last dancer they came out in the s and was the first scifi novel i read where cars were controlled by conputer i think california was given a cultural exception to have a steering wheel
156,anyone read the long run and the last dancer they came out in the s and was the first scifi novel i read where cars were controlled by conputer i think california was given a cultural exception to have a steering wheel
157,how is this even possible as far as i know tesla autopilot requires you to apply pressure to the steering wheel every minute or so if you dont the car will pull over on its own is this story bs or is there a way for tesla autopilot to drive miles without any driver input
158,if his little thing tied around that steering wheel fell off and he was still sleeping he would have slammed into somebody going miles per hour miladinovich said phrasing also miladinovich doesnt seem to under that if his little thing no longer kept the tesla autopilot engaged the car would have turned on the hazard lights and slowed the car to a stop so its possible that someone may have not noticed the stopped car and slammed into the tesla at mph it wouldnt have been the other way around because of a disengaged auto pilot
159,i remember when cruise control came out and people were dying because they thought it was a self driving car
160,theres a long damn way to go before the general public is willing to let software control a pound moving vehicle completely autonomously lots of people are going to be hurt or killed in the process
161,cant be totally asleep teslas require periodic rotational force on the steering wheel to remain in autopilot mode like every minute or three source i own a tesla
162,stop calling it auto pilot people arent smart dont give them a reason to give up complete control of a car like that
163,tesla requires you to move the steering wheel every seconds or so or autopilot will disengage i really doubt they were sleeping
164,how is this surprising at all people are idiots self driving cars are the dumbest idea now theres lane avoidance adaptive cruise control self parking cars people are relying on too much tech and nobodies even learning how to drive properly
165,im sorry but every aspect of the current systems is designed to have a human paying attention and ready to take over at a moments notice its not good for snoozing on the highway its downright dangerous and its exactly the behaviour that is putting self driving back as it needs to be idiot proofed from people who do exactly what is being done by this guy on the highway an even bigger issue will be when people start being comfortable enough to fully turn around or lay back in their cars in the event of an accident whether their fault or not none of the current safety devices will protect from injuries as someones body hits the steering wheel side on or any other position not considered level will be a long long way away in all but the most controlled circumstances
166,im sorry but every aspect of the current systems is designed to have a human paying attention and ready to take over at a moments notice its not good for snoozing on the highway its downright dangerous and its exactly the behaviour that is putting self driving back as it needs to be idiot proofed from people who do exactly what is being done by this guy on the highway an even bigger issue will be when people start being comfortable enough to fully turn around or lay back in their cars in the event of an accident whether their fault or not none of the current safety devices will protect from injuries as someones body hits the steering wheel side on or any other position not considered level will be a long long way away in all but the most controlled circumstances
167,it dings increasingly loudly to try and alert the driver to take control and then safely brings the vehicle to a stop and turns itself off pretty sure theres videos on youtube of people testing it ive seen one at least
168,its not a self driving car its a car with advanced cruise control
169,yes but all teslas have is advanced lane assistance and cruise control
170,there are youtube channels dedicated to driving with tesla autopilot these people are enthusiasts about it and even they cant recommend doing that kind of stuff yet on a min video they usually have to take control back or times which i find really good but not snooze ready what im afraid of is that if you give me minutes of nothingness while the car is doing fine im going to fall asleep
171,all the the real danger is the people distracted by him comments are so obviously damage control by tesla i refuse to believe that the average reddit user is really that dumbbrainwashed that that think someone looking at a car is more dangerous than someone literally asleep at the wheel for miles
172,this tesla are playing with fire and vastly over selling the safety of what is slightly smarter cruise control and this sort of shit is what happens its all fun and lols until that guys tesla hits a situation it cant handle which can include a badly painted lane marking and wipes out a family in a minivan while matey is asleep at the wheel
173,they have sensors in the steering wheel that do the same thing of course they can be tricked or bypassed and some drivers do that
174,this guy rigged up a little weight on the steering wheel to avoid those alerts this was planned negligence
175,you can rig it so autopilot doesnt shut off by hanging something that has a few ounces of weight from the steering wheel
176,clamp a vibrator to the steering wheel problem solved p
177,it can be cheated rather easily often people place fruit in the steering wheel or other objects that fool the system theres plenty of videos on youtube demonstrating this

186,soon there is a lot of time still to go tons of testing with many parties including various government agencies and insurance companies theres half a dozen or more agencies that have to do their work and inspections and they havent even started yet our insurance agent retired and we sat down with the new one this conversation got brought up she had come back from a seminar where this was covered and she said the insurance industry doesnt see autonomous vehicles without a driver coming for at least years and likely longer and one of the hard standing points right now for auto drive vehicles is that a driver must be present and be able to take the controls so no lack of steering wheel vehicles either no sleeping and no inebriation when it comes to truckers good fucking luck between regulations and unions thats going to take even longer than normal vehicles we still dont run fully autonomous trains on preset tracks in the us without engineers

188,absolutely not happening at least not for awhile while the government hasnt had their say yet and when they get their hands on for testing with the dot that will be years worth of decisions and testing but right now insurance agencies are fully sticking to vehicles must contain a driver in a control seat and such drivers must be able to take the wheel at any moment that means no sleeping and no inebriation
189,it can be cheated rather easily often people place fruit in the steering wheel or other objects that fool the system theres plenty of videos on youtube demonstrating this also if you read the article you will see that he has a device to trick the system
190,its not a self driving car more like an advanced cruise control it will deactivate for many reasons this is what upsets majority of people
191,they already have a system in place it can be cheated often people place fruit in the steering wheel or other objects that fool the system theres plenty of videos on youtube demonstrating this also if you read the article you will see that he has a device to trick the system
192,the simple fact that autopilot will relinquish control to the driver if it encounters something unexpected is reason enough to not do this as soon as that is no longer the case i will personally be sleeping on long journeys but as long as that is a possibility this behaviour should be heavily discouraged and legal punishment given to those who do it because like it or not it is a danger to other road users just because people have done it before does not mean it is a good idea i would be freaking out if i saw that because at any moment something could happen causing the autopilot to disengage and the driver wouldnt be aware of anything even if they wake up they will probably not be in a fit state to drive because they just woke up and have absolutely no spacial information about where other vehicles are until these cars can react to every possible situation these risks are and should be illegal and discouraged
193,it can be cheated rather easily often people place fruit in the steering wheel or other objects that fool the system theres plenty of videos on youtube demonstrating this also if you read the article you will see that he has a device to trick the system
194,the driver put clamps on the steering wheel do you people even click links before commenting
195,he was just pretending to freak out other drivers you have to apply pressure to the steering wheel every minute or the car will stop
196,living on the west coast id drive all the way past the continental divide set it to fully auto for a snooze through corn country then regain control through the appalachians
197,yes but imagine someone getting drunk and setting some crazy destination then passing out only to wake up to whatever crazy spot that their drunk self sent them to note this would be in a scenario where drunk driving isnt a possible charge on a level self driving like googles prototype car where you cant even control the driving just the destination
198,exactly how auto pilot responds when steering wheel doesnt detect your hands after that auto pilot will penalize you for x time so you cant enable it until the timer is over in addition to this i wonder if tesla cars one day will connect to your smart watch to detect your health like in the event you have a stroke or something and auto pilot will safely stop the car put hazard lights and call or hell even drive you to a hospital
199,this guy had jury rigged his steering wheel so he didnt have to have his hands on it which demonstrates he intended to take a nap
200,my parents taught me this as well which is why i never use cruise control im sure this reasoning is correct
201,it should be illegal to human operate the vehicle on public roads because that endangers people totally support this because the amount of moronic individuals behind steering wheels is insane but were gonna have to give up the joy of driving around turning the wheel shifting gears and hitting the pedals damn
202,its not that we have to stop fighting each other its the uber rich ruling class that needs to maintain their control that keep us at each others throats and leech off of society
203,just like a bus only it smells less like clifford the big red dog died in the luggage compartment around the same time you last thought about clifford the big red dog and without the probably racist guy that wont stop hitting on me that im afraid to call out for fear hell turn violent or rifle through my duffel the next time i have to take a leak and with lights that i can turn off and it doesnt stop every hour to take on and disgorge human flotsam oh and i can control the ac and the movies and all the surfaces arent coated in a residue so stubbornly sticky that m probably patented it before i was born but yeah otherwise just like a bus if your car is that much like a bus you either dont live in the us or you have the cleaning habits of the average meth addled wildebeest
204,exactly how auto pilot responds when steering wheel doesnt detect your hands vtyzrehvqouc
205,people have always fell asleep in their cars but rarely have they done it so recklessly usually its someone late at night driving for hours with little sleep not someone on their min commute to work not to mention its not a self driving car and the auto pilot will disengage for lots of reasons and he would wind up crashing anyways just a matter of time before it happens the auto pilot requires you to interact with the steering wheel every few minutes or so but it can be cheated rather easily often people place fruit in the steering wheel or other objects that fool the system theres plenty of videos on youtube demonstrating this
206,if you read the article it stated something tied around the steering wheel while this is not proof but it would signify that he found a way to cheat this system as well
207,the article states with something tied around the steering wheel this is a known cheat to their checks to see if the driver is actively paying attention it use to be just putting some type of ball or fruit would be good enough now you have to go to a few extra steps to accomplish what the driver is doing he is actively choosing to do this and ignoring all safety concernsissues associated with it assuming the risks that it could deactivate its not like he randomly fell asleep he planned this out and set it up in advanced so that he could fall asleep youre speculating and throwing random scenarios into this equation the driver would not have gone to this level of trouble if there was no auto pilot therefore he would not of been sleeping hes knowingly risking himself and others to a fatal crash at the very least it spreads ignorance about what this type of car is capable of at this time its not ready for drivers to be sleeping
208,it really depends on who is in charge right now its the shareholders and ceo even if the productivity seminar was the other way around with the actual facts that more freedom and less restriction doesnt necessarily mean less productivity some asshole living in the still is in charge with his good ideas of hard work until workers unions take back control nothing will happen but less life to life
209,the market forces would sort this out or rather control it ratings reviews independent inspections if youre paying ryan air prices and check the must provide a bed car service yeah youre going to get a terrible quality service exactly like right now how market forces sort out hotels you pay bargain bucket prices for a bed in a seedy area exactly the same problems the solution is pay for a better more well respected service presumably the higher paid ones would like hotels hire more staff have more vehicles available and would more regularly after every trip completely clean and replace the bedding thinking about it its literally no different to a hotel at all they have exactly the same issue i wasnt suggesting the high end services would allow multiple bed car trips without cleaning yuck
210,if the corporations that controlled trains didnt start using exploitive practices getting themselves regulated by the government after ww then trains wouldnt be so useless in the us outside of very big cities eg new york trains end up being terrible at actually getting you where youre going theyre already packed much of the time and they dont run very often if they never got those restrictive regulations theres very a good chance they wouldve been built up with the rest of us infrastructure over the last half century a commuter who takes the train to school
211,if so its an elaborate murdersuicide attempt more like and no fault of the systems like using a brick for diy cruise control thats just an idiot
212,parental controls i guess only be able to drive to pre programmed locations the nearest police station hospital
213,except they said in the article that just requires the human to be ready to take control just in case seems automated or am i missing something
214,her statement implies humans dont fuck up too but we can definitely agree that they do it sounds like shes afraid of not having control
215,yeah like that funny ignition switch defect that would lock the steering wheel disable the brakes and airbag
216,not a bad problem to have i mean literally thats what donnation means i dont need it anymore compare that to the situation of charities that report because so many people scam online there are less and less people willing to donate online the general idea was we have unneccesary deaths people die one from a gunshot wound to the head the other one from a missing liver translant lets cut that short by taking the otherwise still useable gunshot victims liver and sowing it into the other patients body we can save one of them guaranteed the idea was never we have a right to those organ numbers we have a right to now demand those organs the idea was never we now get to complain because large numbers of organs are not there where we need them the general idea is innovate your way out of this for example allow some donors to decide for themself how their organs will be used for example i myself would have no problems with my organs being donnated to a poor schlob who never won anything to specify that if my reccipient has plans like climb mount everrest ride the bike or have an active and healthy social life go tell him to fck himself and prioritise the bottom of the list these people whom you wouldnt trust with a fresh vegan liver give them my liver put a smile on their faces shit on the guy who plans to run with the bulls or who has an instagramm account donnate your heart to the bottom of the transplant waiting list your liver to an recovering alcoholic your skin to someone who looks like a two and otherwise would need skingrafts from their own ass and your dick to someone who put chronic masturbation under hobbies let my shit go to people who actually appreciate it not take it for granted i could see a lot of people out of their free will donnating their organs and actually feeling good about it skin blood liver shit i take it like with the computer if anything can be reused before you toss it into the biohazard bin and burry it in an abandoned mineshaft be my gust grab what you need to when it is clear that i dont need it anymore just dont give it to the prick with the hope and stars in their eyes give it to themiserable bastard that has never won anything and make them for once feel like they own the world the downside would be that you would actually have to respect those wishes and such you know i will not be around to check anymore but i am sure it would be a hoot to tell mister schmidt from b that the medical board has a heart for him even though the medical board cant legally give that heart to anyone else but too often when a board decides who gets the organs and who gets a second chance i wanna wipe the smug grins off of their faces and go yea she ugly as fuck but shes a two so the rmeistermalkav clause grips and she gets his skin yes all of it see what she needs cut off the rest make a trendy bag out of it and this is where i see the problem the doctors would never agree to actually respect the donors wishes and hand over their power they would allways push for this little bit of extra of finger waving of such and of course there would be the the people that go i want my body parts to go to someone who is white i know it is harsh but better then publically whining about how fewer transplants we will have because more and more people will surive would be to take the good with the bad just increase the numbers every racist bastard who gets his wish means one fewer place on that list needing to be filled an other option would be medically assisted suicide i am dead serious on that one if all you care is get places of of that list go fuck your ethics board untill they bleed from both ends and offer assisted suicide have a suicide coaster in the back that kills you in a painless safe and guaranteed way in exchange for the right to harvest the organs of course respect these peoples wishes what they want to be done with the organs and the grafts but in the end if you are good enough to whine publically about the list let me remind you that if you pushed for harvesting rights to suicide victims bodies your numbers would look quite different yes there would be the option about not doing harm but that could be done with a patient activated mechanism or and this would be my preferred option actually look into technology look into artificial hearts look into stem cell research and make sure all your people on that waiting list understand that if they vote the people against stem cell research out of office they may actually do the world a bigger favor then by leaving them in and just signing up to be donors just you know become single issue voters for an election my best case only hand the advertising contracts to inform about organ donnations to people who are donors make fun fact sheets allow me to specify my wsh that nobody who is an sjw should get anything from me but if there is any miserable sick son of a bitch that is just a grouch give him my body and tell him to toast me once in a while staple it in and see how it goes use what you can from my body and go fuck your ethics board if you can get it out of my body without retching uncontrollably you are entitled to have it if any of my body ends up in an art project go buy a big pack of smokes for the nearest smoker and tell him my story but i would rather rot completely intact underground and make sure maggots and shit get my body then go to the afterlife with the secure knowledge that my bodyparts are taken for granted and to be distributed as seen fit by a team of medical experts
217,as long as the government doesnt control self driving cars i dont care this is a good problem to have
218,self driving cars are going to be one of the biggest epitomes of totalitarian orwellian style enslavement in the future the joking comments on here about programming them to crash and kill someone every so often actually isnt far off from what will happen in real life i can almost sense the cognitive dissonance of half sarcasm through my computer screen yes you can bet your ass that the likelihood of an autonomous vehicle mysteriously driving you off of a bridge will be higher if you end up on too many of the governments naughty lists that should be common sense for anyone with a pulse and who doesnt have their head up their ass as for the overall lowering of the mortality rate it would appear that the proponents of driverless cars are missing a very important point that a one in chance of dying due to human error is better than a one in chance of dying due to a computer error its the same reason that people who have no problem driving a car on an mile an hour highway where they know full well that they have a better chance of being killed than in a plane crash are terrified of flying and its for a good reason its not some irrational thought process that goes on in the human mind its about being in control of ones own physical well being which is a right by default it goes hand in hand with the proverb of those who are willing to give up a little freedom for a little security deserve neither and will receive none i liken the push for autonomous vehicles to the war on guns and the war on cash only to the half witted yuppie imbeciles is it about the promotion of things like safety for the common good and convenience for the individual to ignore the obvious dark side is to drink the technocratic cool aid
219,lets make the cars fuck up from time to time and bingo we have a control over the amount of donors
220,just fine tune the cars so they speed out of control once in a while problem solved
221,easy enough to solve just program the cars to sideswipe people using the older manually controlled carsor occasionally self driving competitorswhen the computer thinks it can get away with it
222,not to mention taking away right to assembly if they could control when and where you can go thats some sort of orwellan nightmare
223,nah the main character survives and the rest of the episode is the government trying to track down the person and eventually we learn its population control because all of the organs people are getting are grown from stem cells anyway
224,there are more than people currently on transplant waiting lists my intuition great source is that not many of these patients need organs because of trauma from an accident since motor vehicle accidents are such an obvious source of organs i found it difficult near impossible to find out how many accident or trauma victims are put on the organ transplant receiving list the liver is one of the most commonly injured organs in trauma and also one of the common organs to transplant i found the following information in this study which indicates of liver transplants went to victims of motor vehicle accidents all liver transplantations at our institution were reviewed retrospectively this covered liver transplants between september and december of them transplants were performed due to motor vehicle accidents which caused uncontrollable acute liver trauma in patients however there appears to be a bias against organ transplant in trauma patients for fear of bad outcomes and wasting organs so trauma victims probably dont get all the organ transplants they need
225,at least in most state of the usa next of kin usually the relatives have final control over whether donation occurs not sure why but im guessing the philosophy behind it is that the dead should defer to the living
226,i wish if i know anything about people its that when a person is not in control its expected to work perfectly every time if a machine is put in control even if it is statistically better than a person people will reject it until its utterly perfect especially when it comes to something critical like this
227,while at a system level the decision will be made by government types at the ground it will be the individual are they comfortable giving up control of the vehicle despite the average person believing they have above average driving skills if its uber auto pilot will they just accept it and trust because thats the only reasonable option available or because of cost this is only a transitory phase anyway progress will continue to be made and in a year or so autonomous cars will be that much better than humans at driving give it years and us meat bags wont have any more excuses
228,i must disagree with the articles pronouncement of what we need to accept the burden is on the technology developers to clearly demonstrate that their design is better than the status quo enough better to justify the added cost in the earlier days of self driving cars there was a wholly unwarranted presumption on the part of many that self driving cars were going to be absolutely safe and the general public is slowly becoming educated on the limitations of the technology if you really understand how deep learning systems operate youll know that theyre a total black box that cannot be verified to operate properly by any manner of proof its been demonstrated that changing of even a single pixel can change object classification decisions its been demonstrated that pasting small images of other signs in the blank space of signs can cause them to be misrecognized because the black block deep learning recognizers are designed to read signs at a variety of scales in the recent uber case a software failure caused the perception of a pedestrian obstacle in the middle of the road to be effectively ignored all this technology is also going to cost money itll make cars more expensive but the ability to drive away from the destination enables cars to be shared which can greatly affect the actual cost of ownership the number of cars on the road and the occupancy and eventually the need for parking spaces nevertheless if the added cost of the technology isnt balanced by a decrease in the cost of killing and maiming drivers passengers occupants of other vehicles pedestrians and bystanders we should be highly resistant to accepting these products thats not to say its the way its going to happen people were so in love with their cell phones that they failed to resist the temptation to use them while they were driving exacting an extremely high cost in lives lost and injuries that persist to the present day users are paying the price of this in their automobile insurance cost but these costs are not redeemed by the companies responsible for the manufacture marketing or sales of cell phones so far cell phone makers havent been obliged to pay for a failure to make their products safe regulation has encouraged makers to add facilities for hands free use which has not yet been proven to make them safe to use while driving indeed studies to date suggest that users still become too cognitively occupied to safely operate a vehicle and a phone together current half driving cars on the market present another danger particularly given users penchants for operating them beyond the stated capabilities defeating safety systems such as by pressing an orange into the steering wheel and so forth theres been clear evidence that reducing the drivers workload with these systems makes the driver less attentive to the task rendering them unable to assist the half driver when it malfunctions or needs to pass control back to the driver unlike airplanes where there may be many seconds before an autopilot controlled plane becomes unsafe or uncontrollable the geometry of the driving task demands sub second responses to unusual conditions
229,i must disagree with the articles pronouncement of what we need to accept the burden is on the technology developers to clearly demonstrate that their design is better than the status quo enough better to justify the added cost in the earlier days of self driving cars there was a wholly unwarranted presumption on the part of many that self driving cars were going to be absolutely safe and the general public is slowly becoming educated on the limitations of the technology if you really understand how deep learning systems operate youll know that theyre a total black box that cannot be verified to operate properly by any manner of proof its been demonstrated that changing of even a single pixel can change object classification decisions its been demonstrated that pasting small images of other signs in the blank space of signs can cause them to be misrecognized because the black block deep learning recognizers are designed to read signs at a variety of scales in the recent uber case a software failure caused the perception of a pedestrian obstacle in the middle of the road to be effectively ignored all this technology is also going to cost money itll make cars more expensive but the ability to drive away from the destination enables cars to be shared which can greatly affect the actual cost of ownership the number of cars on the road and the occupancy and eventually the need for parking spaces nevertheless if the added cost of the technology isnt balanced by a decrease in the cost of killing and maiming drivers passengers occupants of other vehicles pedestrians and bystanders we should be highly resistant to accepting these products thats not to say its the way its going to happen people were so in love with their cell phones that they failed to resist the temptation to use them while they were driving exacting an extremely high cost in lives lost and injuries that persist to the present day users are paying the price of this in their automobile insurance cost but these costs are not redeemed by the companies responsible for the manufacture marketing or sales of cell phones so far cell phone makers havent been obliged to pay for a failure to make their products safe regulation has encouraged makers to add facilities for hands free use which has not yet been proven to make them safe to use while driving indeed studies to date suggest that users still become too cognitively occupied to safely operate a vehicle and a phone together current half driving cars on the market present another danger particularly given users penchants for operating them beyond the stated capabilities defeating safety systems such as by pressing an orange into the steering wheel and so forth theres been clear evidence that reducing the drivers workload with these systems makes the driver less attentive to the task rendering them unable to assist the half driver when it malfunctions or needs to pass control back to the driver unlike airplanes where there may be many seconds before an autopilot controlled plane becomes unsafe or uncontrollable the geometry of the driving task demands sub second responses to unusual conditions
230,it is not rational for an excellent driver to cede control to an inferior machine it is reasonable enough i suppose for a bad driver to cede to a superior machine then again it is even more reasonable for a bad driver to pay attention and adopt safer driving practices so im not seeing us reasoning our way into self driving vehicles that kill us tl dr statistical improvements in survival rates do not necessarily translate to what make sense for individuals
231,no i dont accept ever you go ahead and give up the liberty of free movement to a machine that can be controlled remotely i never will and neither will my children
232,the biggest concern i have with this is whose life is prioritized in case of an imminent accident lets say a child runs out into the road after a ball or something self driving car rolls up and does not have enough time to stop and the only options are a hit the kid or b avoid the kid at the cost of hitting a tree either scenario it is likely someone will be seriously injured or killed how can a machine be programmed to make split second decisions to minimize fatalities and injuries the kid was really doing nothing wrong but should the passengers be killed for something out of their control
233,i never understand this mentality self driving cars will never be accepted if you are asking people to accept that self driving cars can kill people its like asking people to get on a roller coaster ride but people may die on it randomly but people should accept that risk for roller coaster ride sure you might argue that human drivers have higher statistics of road accidents than self driving cars but youre ignoring that people think that in human driving those who drive properly and follow rules have significantly low risk of being in an accidents and its true too to some extent so theres an element of control here so human psychology has a tendency to think that if i drive properly ill be rewarded by safety pay attention follow the rules and my driving will keep me protected but thats not the case with self driving cars even if youre a good driver it does not have any outcome on how car drives thats like taking away control from the hands of humans its like playing russian roulette where its totally upto luck and not your driving whether youll be killed on this particular car ride or not so everytime you get in self driving car it may be your last ride and you can do nothing about it i think this will be a significant barrier in mass adoption of self driving cars unless they make their system perfect
234,if people dont come to accept self driving cars maybe manufacturers will just continue loading them with standard safety features like automatic braking and collision avoidance then even more advanced ones until driving is basically like the close door button on an elevator the wheel and pedals will just be there to convince us we have control
235,ppl enjoy drivin though so driverless cars will have their place in transportation but you will still have humans who will want to be in control of their vehicle at least some of the time
236,i will not accept autonomous cars randomly killing people in wrecks why because i have control over myself not dying in a car wreck because i am a great driver i would prefer to let the terrible drivers continue to kill themselves instead of letting an autonomous car take away my ability to drive well and not die
237,can you imagine the backlash and outrage if someone said automated personal defense firearms will kill innocent people but you just need to accept that fewer will die than if only people controlled firearms
238,i dispute this i have been driving for thirty years and not had an accident ill not give up control to ai and have it kill me
239,uber does not get a pass on this it was predicted that based on the number of times uber safety drivers needed to take over for the car unexpectedly that they were times more likely to crash than a normal human driver this was based on their record from driving in california which required them to report those statistics something they did not have to provide while driving in other states tesla suspended their operations in california because they did not like the reporting and testing requirements tesla has also been pretty lax about their auto pilot advertising leading people to believe its more like a planes autopilot than what it actually is a much safer version of cruise control its likely already saved some lives but its also endangeredkilled others check out tesla barrier lust to see teslas that steer straight into barriers im much more likely to give tesla a pass because i believe their testing is more thorough and theres plenty of proof that teslas have saved lives if you compare either company to waymo youll find their track records arent as impressive waymo has gone fully autonomous rather than the semi autonomous route there have not been any waymo deaths yet and its because theyve put a value on caution instead of i dont doubt that a waymo car will someday be involved in a deadly accident but at that point im going to assume it was something a human driver couldnt have predicted either unless facts state otherwise i believe in giving credit where its due and not every self driving car company is out to save lives some are being far too loose in their safety standards in the name of potential profits
240,this is true unfortunately lobbyists will say but if the driver had control he could have avoided it this can be circumvented by allowing the driver to take control at any time perhaps some training too
241,agree with the message but in the article itself theres a couple nitpicks and things to expand on the risk of human drivers next we need to acknowledge just how bad human drivers are at controlling their own vehicles and how they compare to autonomous vehicles in there were vehicular fatalities just in the united states a stanford review found that percent of accidents are caused at least in part by human error whether thats overcorrecting falling prey to a distraction or drinking alcohol before getting behind the wheel some quick math tells you thats lives that were lost because a human behind the wheel of a car made a mistake with similar numbers year over year here they used the words and how they human drivers compare to autonomous vehicles but in the statistic they provide they dont account for the ratio of autonomous vehicles to manually operated vehicles that would be the more interesting and relevant statistic and we could really see if self driving cars are less accident prone also this quote in the section self driving cars are going to kill people period no matter what people are going to die at the hands of an autonomous vehicle the quote marks seem to imply it but i think its important to note the distinction that theres a difference between the autopilot being partiallyat fault in an accident and the autopilot doing everything perfectly in an unavoidable accident occurring because of unfortunate outside circumstances if people recognise that distinction itll lead to more objectivity and less clickbait
242,sure but companies can be irresponsible like uber who disabled their emergency brake system because it was braking too much and tesla who came up with the name autopilot for what is essentially lane guidance cruise control semiautomatic braking
243,liability is the word here whos at fault people will die on the roads either way but theres a process in place to punish peoples carelessness far from perfect but it exists whos at fault when theres nobody in control
244,yeah nope i wont put my life in the hands of a vehicle i have no control over
245,the cars will pull a dr strange and calculate all the potential outcomes in less time than it takes you to figure out a handful given car car communication the first time i experienced lane control i didnt know i had it blew my mind and is phenomenally useful
246,its a weird dilemma when our lives are in our own hands we feel like we have control even tho were statistically less safe than having a robot drive for us hm
247,the problem is whos accountant for that accident right now it is easy since drivers have total control but even with this there are problems to get properly accountability so insurances can pay what ever needs to be apid so i dont wanna start thinking about the nightmare atuonomous drive will bring
248,im going to be starting my masters in control systems engineering with a focus in autonomous vehicle communication in about a year my firm believer about self driving vehicles is that they are safer but only in a system composed mostly of autonomous vehicles reduce risk of human error create a self referencing grid ect this will never happen because the cost of the technology keeps it out of financial reach of most of the population so people will continue to die and we will continue this debate till were blue in the face
249,i wish everyone would understand this because autonomous vehicle deaths absolutely are going to happen and the media is absolutely going to sensationalize each and every one every death will be a national news story and the more infrequently these deaths happen the more news worthy they are when the do occur people like to ignore the hundreds that are killed every single day by manually controlled vehicles
250,i dont even like cruise control and where are the ctrlaltdel buttons and if you dont think some russian hackers wouldnt fuck with this i got a bridge in brooklyn to sell you
251,i think this is the same reason itll be a long time before air travel is fully automated and there will always at least be a technician or somebody similar on board in case things go wrong right now the airline is working towards taking th first officer out of the cockpit but even that will take time to change faa rules company policy which also requires faa approval for an aircraft to be developed and approved and then for the airlines to be looking to buy a brand new fleet which requires new support staff new multi million dollar simulators etc and thats too still have a pilot in the plane those issues aside i cant imagine the pilot less plane will be welcomed by the general public for the exact reason you stated many see that we can develop the technology to a very safe level but there will probably always be a paranoia about it by the general public the city of atlanta tried to put in a conductorless metrotrain and there was such an outcry about it the city pays somebody to sit at the front in a uniform but no controls to do anything i dont remember the exact story and cant find a source but its a story a heard about might be bullshit but i think the point is the same about people freaking out about it as driverless cars become more popular people may become more accepting of it but only time will tell
252,for many and you can see posts hinting at it in this very thread its not about safety or convenience or whats best for everyone they just dont want to give up control same as the gun debate privacy vs security debate and so many others especially in the us if anything is going to happen the decision makers have to accept that its going to piss a lot of people off and just do it
253,like drones the military kind kill people today oh yeah the government takes control over the vehicle and kills somebody they dont like blame the self driving car we have to accept that they will occasionally kill people

256,i think a problem is that it will introduce a random factor you have no control if there is an accident whereas in the same situation where you had a control the accident could have been avoided
257,i generally like the idea of self driving cars and electronics in vehicles overall until we start having the conversation about the fact that government is likely going to be able to control our vehicles remotely by law one day itll be billed as a huge advancement for public safety for law enforcement to be able to disable someones vehicle remotely but thats some orwellian shit i dont want any of
258,i think we should consider that its worse for a human to die when he or she has no control over it an autonomous car killing a human is worse than a human killing them selves due to error he or she can can have free will over their error which results in death a human in an autonomous car has no control over their potential death
259,i think what people dont like about it is they have no control over their death if i drive like a twat and end up killing myself i have it coming but me sitting on my morning commute reading the paper and then suddenly something happens so the car runs me off the road or head first into a lorry is not really an enjoyable thought
260,guys the tesla bot network that elon was bragging about that controls reddit is taking a dark turn
261,idk how i feel about this i get that theres less of a chance of me dying but i wont have control over it id rather be driving the car myself and getting into an accident than having the car do it for me is that a weird thing to say
262,no we dont have to accept that we can just build transit systems that are intrinsically safe instead of retaining the horse and buggy without the horse now with a computer trying desperately to emulate a human which is brutally hard skytran for instance if you have to design in criteria like ok we have an emergency who should the car kill pedeistrains or the occupants youre designing a shitty ass useless system that has no justification for existing i just cant believe this massive blind spot everyone seems to have cars are a bad technology for transporting people theyre also a very bad technology for transporting goods both those things can be done immensely better with something like maglev rail passive or active maglev depending on size people traffic on the local plane should be walking cycling or electric buggies that move pretty slow the transit systems that move people further should be at least meters in the air to make collisions impossible why wouldnt we build faster safer and cleaner options naah its too hard and you have to build too much lets just keep maintaining these stupid ass expensive roads and kill people on them with metal boxes hurtling out of control that makes so much more sense what
263,it is not rational for an excellent driver to cede control to an inferior machine
264,to bring autonomous cars up to the standards of in my opinion it has much more to do with who do you blame when things go wrong the software hardware etc the the trolley problem vbopfkcwyyw after all a an autonomous car is in control right
265,im not comfortable giving up control i cant imagine being at the mercy of an automated machine when it malfunctions as the person driving the malfunctioning autonomous car it would be horrifying to be powerless to stop an injury or fatality theres little that car companies care about besides making money if the predicted cost of liability in this transition period is relatively low compared to predicted company profits it will move forward with autonomous vehicles regardless of the moral implications a human driver has a much higher sense of moral obligation and would almost never choose to endanger others due to a financial cost benefit analysis i just hate to think that the reason for the deaths and injuries to come is one of monetary gain and greater good mentality
266,you know i was about to pounce on your comment as a strawman but no i guess he kinda did say that even our most underdeveloped models will most likely be an improvement as much as i do believe that ai operated vehicles will end up being superior to humans at some point and as much as theres a clear irrational fear of letting a machine have such direct control over your life i do have to grudgingly accept your statement that we should not allow such a system to be implemented until it has been thoroughly audited and tested
267,i see a huge dip in safety between driver assist features and level autonomous because there is confusion as who is in control there is this attempt to blame human drivers for not catching the mistakes of auto pilot but even if youre paying attention youre going to wait for the auto pilot to react this adds a second or two to your reaction time with driver assist features like pedestrian braking the car catches your mistake not the other way around
268,my ex works programming self driving cars and what you are saying is a frequent topic of conversation in his office that most people including the ones working there arent willing to accept once theyve swallowed the self driving car kool aid self driving cars can really only ever be a safe reality in cases like garbage trucks where you have a pre planned route and a safety handler present shuttle routes on places like campuses which are a comparatively controlled environment enhanced cruise control like tesla and possibly services like uber where you would have a driver remotely controlling the car the idea that youre gonna have cars driving themselves all over the freeways is absurd as long as people drive in those roads theres just too many variables that make the self driving cars into an enormous liability however he thinks that might be the plan once everyone prefers self driving cars you could turn the highways into routes for the cars in the way few people can drive manual today few people will drive at all and just rely on this service and yea it will be a service people wont own cars anymore so self diving eliminates our autonomy and need to drive its amazing technology for some applications but not all
269,there is a good chance that you might die to some other humans mistake so you cant really control who is responsible
270,i get it you think you are in control and that youre not at risk but you most definitely are good drivers die every day by the dozens and this technology will reduce the fatality rate immensely yes it introduces a new agent into the equation robo driver and that robot wont be perfect but it will be better its natural to fear this new risk and to want to stick with what youre used to but the net risk is going to go down big time allow me to illustrate hypothetically lets say your chances of dying of cancer in the next years is but a new free pill came out on the market that can almost eliminate your risk of cancer dropping your probability of cancer death to however that pill also adds a side effect that may cause it to actually give you cancer the probability of that happening is so this new pill lowers the probability of cancer death by a huge amount but in very rare cases it actually causes cancer death should you take that pill of course you should take that pill which will reduce your probability of cancer death from to it would be dumb to get caught up on the fact that the pill adds a new risk of cancer when it more than offsets that new risk by eliminating of the current risk the pill way improves your probability of avoiding death overall so dont be a dummy use it by the same token we should adopt the new safer form of transportation sure the robot could fuck up and kill you but the odds of it happening will be lower than very good human drivers yourself included killing you there will be no reward for taking the extra mortality risk associated a human driver the machines are already better than humans at most maneuvers and it is a matter of time until they dominate us across the board it will be very soon only hard headedness fear of change distrust of machines and ego will hold this process back prepare yourselves to take this damned pill people it will almost certainly improve your life and the lives of others like the elderly it will reduce fatalities and injuries it will solve traffic jams it will be soooooo much better embrace it
271,totally agree everyone here seems to think the tech already exists and is completely safe when the best that is out there is enhanced cruise control long long way before fully autonomous
272,fatalities per miles driven is the stat to look at not pure number self driving cars really dont work currently at best its cruise control plus
273,this is the truth also people like to drive and to control and to rage theyre not just going to give that up
274,i think this is close i think most driving deaths arent completely random a person who drinks and drives or texts and drives are more likely to die in general theres the assumption that a driver can do things through good habits and good skills to minimize their chances of dying however a person in an automated car is pretty much just as likely to die as anyone else it is completely out of their control while the chances of a person dying may be way less it will have to be extremely less to convince most people especially when everyone who does die will make the news for the foreseeable future even then i think most people will get their first self driving car thinking ill slightly increase my risk of dying for the convenience of not having to drive
275,i dont think people are afraid of the technology i think people are opposed to giving up one more piece of control over their lives in the name of a progress that promises nothing in return but another layer of bubble wrap between them and the world
276,whats the difference between being an airline passenger and a passenger in an autonomous car would you argue that airplanes should be less safe just so people can have more control
277,milions of people all over the planet now own a vehicle that can transport you wherever you need to go with the only effort on your part being to haul your carcass in and out of it we have voice activated devices like google home that can control every aspect of our house with just a few simple commands were surrounded by convenience were already lazy slobs this same logic was used to try and prevent vehicles existing in the first place how can you then try and apply it to what essentially boils down to just increased convenience you know what i can actually provide data to back this up the service industry comprises of the worlds economy and in countries like france and the us its basically enwikipediaorgwikilist_of_countries_by_gdp_sector_composition enwikipediaorgwikilist_of_countries_by_gdp_sector_composition
278,nothing will work of the time and you cant control every cercimstance humans are create lots of errors these machines are built by humans
279,theres a philosophical element as well the idea that we are at least somewhat in control of our own existence and morally culpable for for what we do and what happens to us being a part of society means being subject to human fallibility and accepting our role in it when automated cars become very common and fatal accidents occur regularly well begin to lose our sense of self actualization and feel more and more like grist in the mill
280,id assume that itd come down to the manufacturer assuming responsibility but with a million clauses that count as assuming manual control or whatever that would include things like roads under _ width or with _ variables where if there is a mistake it is your fault for taking the car there
281,and if merging on the freeway get up to the fuxking speed limit living in florida every fucking person gets on the freeway at you accelarate hard to freeway speed and go around then about five minutes later they pass you doing mph only to slow to in a mph zone because of course the person who passed them doing the same speed as the rest of traffic is clearly the asshole not the complete idiot with zero idea of the concept of freeways and merging and general vehicle control that tried merging at nearly half the speed everyone else was doing oh my god its ridiculous driving is a priveledge not a right
282,i grew up in germany got my license there lived there for years then i moved to the us had to take a test to get a drivers license here and have been driving here for years now yes the difference is absolutely real i dont remember how many hours of driving school you have to take in germany but it was a lot in the us its about half as much and your terrible driver parent can teach you the rest therefore perpetuating bad habits in germany i had to take a one hour driving test in real traffic with situations demanding real control and decision making in the us the driving test was on an enclosed parking lot with nobody else on it was minutes long and involved exactly three things parallel parking three way turn and stopping at a stop sign drivers in germany generally follow rules and respect other drivers they may be speeding but they typically let people merge lanes use their signals and pay attention to traffic of course there are exceptions but they are exceptions in the us egocentric drivers who only have their own interest in mind are the norm you have to plan two miles out to get to the right lane if your exit is coming up because you never know who will let you merge when you have to get off the freaking highway people drive slow on the left lane you get overtaken on the left right anything goes people keep no proper distance to other cars because that would mean you leave room for other cars to merge into your lane on my commute i see about of drivers around me on their phone or otherwise not paying attention to the road
283,thats way too far off and current self driving cars depend on most of what you think we can get rid of also shit happens so we need to be able to take control ourselves saving millions not billions and not really in the construction maintenance area
284,yes around a decade ago when google started building their self driving car they came up with a simple highway adaptive cruise controllane assist and gave it to employees and found that most of them were completely distracted on their phones dozing off looking out windows etc this is what convinced them that its pretty much all or nothing l and under is not gonna cut it
285,i respect how dangerous driving is and how many people die from it its awful to think that there are people out there causing accidents for stupid reasons like texting and driving or whatever it may be on the other hand there are a lot of people out there who really love driving if everybody in the world thought driving was a chore self driving cars would be widely popular and probably already implemented everywhere people enjoy controlling their vehicles and enjoying the sense of freedom it brings ideally id like a self driving car that can be self driving when i want it to and lets me turn that off and drive myself but would take over control if i make a mistake that way people like me who love driving are happy that they can still enjoy that and cars will still be safer
286,i mean im glad your cruise control works but thats kind of a different thing entirely than a fully automated car
287,yeah the tech still seems pretty shitty and still heavily relies on a human driver making the hard calls its frankly a misnomer to call them self driving at this point its more of an advanced cruise control then anything were a long way from true self driving
288,yep but at least i know ill be in control of mine
289,its not all random though there are going to be accidents that could have been avoided had it been you at the wheel and not the computer i feel that that loss of control is my issue with it
290,i think this is over played its hard to base a safety case upon sensors extrinsic to the vehicle because its difficult to verify data integrity in any case the vehicle must be safe in isolation eg it must pass an elk test in fog at night either by seeing through the fog or driving within the limits of its sensors intra vehicle data cannot replace conventional signals because human drivers are still legal at eis so the manoeuvre cadence cant increase vehicle manufacturers have little incentive to share data because if eg fords cooperate with fords then network effects will favour big players freeze out disruptive new entrants legislation may therefore be required to force sharing however integrity is harder if the standard is open this sort of distributed asynchronous system is really hard to police no i dont think blockchain is the solution i suppose it could be done with public key cryptography a really big database of vins but then integrity verification would depend on internet access which might not be dependable eg in tunnels or remote areas i therefore think it will be limited to more controlled environments like road trains controlled by single operators or non safety critical uses better traffic data for strategic routing decisions as distinct from tactical manoeuvre decisions
291,those people are still going to be driving manually because they want the control we will eventually ban the squishies but the transition is going to be awful
292,not me im a terrible driver and i know it thats why i just dont drive mentally i just cant handle the idea of a multi tonne cannonball firing down the road at a hundred miles an hour and im the one in control one wrong move for a split second and a dozen people die one failure in the insanely complex machine im trapped inside of and a dozen people die no thank you
293,if people learned how to use cruise control this wouldnt be a problem so much alas people pay more attention to the climate controls or entertainment instead
294,grew up in the midwest with daily minutes highway commutes and had many games of im going under but that doesnt mean you should pass me games where i go to pass they speed up i get back over and they slow down again or the really obnoxious one where you pass them before they had time to react and then you resume your cruise control setting that made you catch up to them in the first place only to have them speed up pass and then creep back down to where you have to slow down and then wait for another opportunity to pass very flat land cruise control speed was constant so it wasnt like my speed was varying because of hills or anything like really if you waited just a few minutes id be far enough ahead that you wouldnt feel like you were behind me anymore you had to speed up to catch me speed up more to pass obviously i wasnt impeding you happens on the sidewalk too here several times i have passed someone or a group on the sidewalk and then get stuck at an intersection waiting to cross only to have them catch up then move around and step in front of me waiting for the light to change then i have to try to pass them again on small sidewalks and dense two way traffic its very annoying but people seem to think anyone in front of them will slow them down as they stroll at a pedestrian pace during commute hours have some self awareness and consideration of others
295,not really if water was directed by a conscious force it would go down much quicker similarly if cars were controlled by a central system they would move much quicker just like the underground doesnt have traffic unfortunately these are not the type of driverless cars being built
296,even if you are a better driver than most youre still going to be objectively worse than any halfway decent autopilot you rely on human perception and response times youre easily distracted can only focus your attention on one thing at a time the list goes on an autopilot can control a car to the very limits of the cars ability controlling throttle brakes and steering with millisecond response times even the absolute best human driver is basically going to be trash compared to autopilot
297,let me put it this way hypothetically when you get the car with no steering wheel the manufacturer will make you sign a waiver saying that you can buy the car but you accept the risk that it will get in an accident through countless years of experimentation they prove that by using their system you are less likely to get in an accident but if you do get in an accident you will be liable unless of course someone elses car hit you so youre choices are use their system and accept the of getting in an accident that you already agreed to be liable for dont use their system and drive yourself and accept the more risk of getting in an accident youre liable for both choices result in you being liable but option means your much less likely to get in an accident not only that but insurance companies will look at those statistics and greatly reduce your premium if you choose since they are less likely to have to pay you out conversely if you choose option your premiums will be much higher because the odds that they have to pay up are higher hope that helps explain why the driver will always be liable in the case of sdc accidents their system doesnt half to be perfect it just has to be better than people
298,no need for central control only communication with nearby cars thats peer to peer communication
299,cruise control is so useful especially in small towns where cops lay out speed traps and get you for one or two over
300,you dont need to eliminate accidents though you need to make them safer than humans i think what we will see is more and more self driving features a human will be required but the advanced cruise control features are going to get even more advanced than they currently are go test drive a new audi a and see how it goes its amazing
301,you dont need to eliminate accidents though you need to make them safer than humans i dont know what this means though i think what we will see is more and more self driving features a human will be required but the advanced cruise control features are going to get even more advanced than they currently are go test drive a new audi a and see how it goes its amazing if you could go ahead and stop trying to sell me a car that would be great i have people insulting me i have to reply to
302,the animals need mind control helmets
303,with mind control helmets you could have a flock of autonomous sheep that could go around and eat the grass on peoples lawns so that they would never have to mow their yard again maybe computer controlled lcd blinders on the sheep instead of mind control could make them go in a certain direction and respect the boundaries of the target region then when they are done they go to the next yard being sure to cross the street only at the places marked with animal crossing signs
304,yes mind control helmets and moon shoes images nassl images amazoncomimagesixevdzl_sx_jpg then we can post them on rbossfight for the record im a fan of rbossfight
305,at the moment even the best self driving system is in reality a very advanced cruise control thats why drivers have to keep alert in the vehicles cause eventually the vehicle will come across a situation it cant account for humans will be needed for quite a while still
306,a thing to take note of is that most self driving marketing has focused on consumer vehicles i cant recall a single ounce of hype regarding commercial trucking despite it being a gold mine for self driving technology and having relatively simpler use cases further you may note that most self driving demonstrations are in highly controlled environments the technology is just too limited at the moment so id wager five to ten years until you see general application for just average drivers regarding trucking theres likely never going to be a point where you have no driver involved not that the technology wont be able to replace but because the risk factor is too large ai applications invariably have a margin of uncertainty its just how the world works when youre talking about the scale of how far commercial trucking must travel and the economic cost of a damaged shipment not to mention the collateral of a truck crashing into something its just more economic to hire a driver as a failsafe there will likely be pay cuts since you become a glorified babysitter but it doesnt make sense to me to simply eliminate the profession
307,of autonomous driving check out this article on the different levels of autonomous driving tesla is still trying to perfect level for passenger cars i dont know if it will be easier to do for passenger or heavy trucks but until they get to level someone will always need to be behind the wheel and have the ability to take control of the vehicle
308,technologically pretty close i think it was years ago they did a test wish with a self driving big rig on the highway human driver was watching from his sleeper cabin iirc that one didnt test controlling an wheeler in city streets just highways more recently theyve done more tests and of course uber was testing autonomous taxis in arizona years ago so from a technology standpoint i wouldnt be surprised if any day now there was an announcement of an entirely driverless cartruck legislatively thats where its going to get complicated theres a lot of legal issues to sort out liability whose at fault etc and so on and what there isnt is will to solve those problems but once the will is there i expect theyll be solved relatively quickly and youll start seeing fully autonomous commercial vehicles that said when that happens its not going to be an overnight thing there will be a slow conversion of the truck fleets and probably a few hiccups when theres some big high profile crash involving an autonomous truck and a rolls dice busful of special needs elementary students so when it finally starts there will be time probably at least a decade if not decades to dive a new career
309,what i found interesting and why ride very beginning when waymo stops to let you in youtubetbjgvsqeak t it just sort of hangs out well away from the curb barely on the right side of a street i know they hand map pickupdropoff locations and this is like a super small side road so it is no problem but i would have expected the pickup to be the other side of the street heading out and the car would be better positioned pickupdropoff locations are a long tail hard part of the puzzle for sure turning around in the cul de sac youtubetbjgvsqeak t was both super impressive and annoying at the same time it bothers me for some reason turning the wheel that much without moving when they eventually remove the wheel im going to be wondering what the car is doing just sitting there so at least right now the wheel provides context from other parts of the video they seem to have the concept of slowly moving to pre position the wheel while moving slowly maybe the gas platform doesnt give them enough control to do this reliably in tight spaces like this leaving the small pickup street youtubetbjgvsqeak t the car didnt come to a full stop is this legal getting on the main street youtubetbjgvsqeak t takes a good bit of time maybe right turns onto double lane streets is the new unprotected left in the atlanta suburbs where i live you would be trapped until pm exiting like this car does you have to exit x more aggressively or you wont make it out avoids a trailer youtubetbjgvsqeak t parked in the road after a degree bend in the road tesla would will have trouble doing that given its current sensor locations another right onto a dual lane road youtubetbjgvsqeak t that takes a bit this one is extra interesting as it is careful to wait even when it has a clear lane but lets a car in the adjacent lane get by before turning i do the same thing on roads with light traffic since you never know when someone will change lanes on you man this car is noisy youtubetbjgvsqeak t im not sure if its the filming equipment for some of it there are more rattles road noise creaks steering wheel groans etc that any car ive ridden in lately id stab the blinker speaker with a knife if i owned this car lots of talk about it turning the wheels ahead of time youtubetbjgvsqeak t like in this situation i think they do this to reduce reaction time on unprotected lefts maybe i think they have issues with low speed throttlesteering coordination in general either way it doesnt have to be a saftey problem they should know if someone is about to hit them and they could turn the wheels in the direction of least danger before impact is waymo really this loud from outside youtubetbjgvsqeak t or is the gain on the mic up a lot or have i just owned a tesla too long at this point sounds like a bus vacuum or light aircraft

311,ride pedestrian handling is impressive youtubetbjgvsqeak t but to be honest im taking a point off for not simply avoiding the front at all costs i guess its in testing but hopefully they have a switch to avoid the front doors of costco and target all other stores dont seem as bad but those two are time sinks i will also say this is super light pedestrian traffic from my experiences in atlanta you have to push your way through and it still takes minutes to drive by the front doors apparently chandler has a fashion center youtubetbjgvsqeak t who knew runs a yellow light youtubetbjgvsqeak t which is good example of steering wheel glitching youtubetbjgvsqeak t that happens from time to time not sure what this is or why it happens the car doesnt seem to move its almost like a weird very small shutter arrival notice youtubetbjgvsqeak t seems to be based on point to point distance rather than remaining time previously you would get a notice as you made the final turn but here you get it well before you arrive because you have to basically do a long u turn to arrive something they should work on not a huge issue but you start having problems with seat belts being removed and such if you notice too soon
312,this is correct because it means that when the vehicle determines there is a wide enough gap it can go now for control algorithms this is much easier also means the gap required can be smaller
313,whats going on when the steering wheels make these odd rapid side to side twitches youtubetbjgvsqeak t
314,well its just a steering controlecu issue the car is using steering wheel angles swa and reference points to calculate the angle of the steering wheel perfectly horizontal and center steering is angle and making calculations to turn the steering wheel to the left or right in your timestamp the car is making a left lane change to get into the left turn lane so the wheel is turning left and then countersteering to the right to get back to the center or swa essentially its what humans would do but we dont have to worry about calculations or algorithms when we turn the wheel its smooth but the car is trying to turn the wheel and then counter turn the wheel all within a few seconds at the end of the day its still a robot the actions it takes are going to be for some part robotic though i would argue that if there is a good collaboration between fca and waymo those steering movements can be much smoother because fca can share data on their internal can system values and ecu configurations

316,the rattling is coming from the plexiglass shield thats not usually there but you know special circumstances im surprised they havent planned on having them from the beginning but i think youre correct these were a quick retro fit i think they needed them to protect the driver and more importantly the controls when in full self driving mode like they are now im pretty down on them for their platform choice but i acknowledge this is still just a testing platform i hope they are learning and do better with the next car i still think they should buy a car manufacture and build them i wouldnt suggest anyone else on earth to do that buy waymo should i do think my camera auto gain was making it a little louder than it actually is externally i was hoping that was it with point one usually i can choose the side of the street it picks me up on yeah i didnt realize that until i saw your excellent part about picking the drop off point but this was an odd case where there was only one predetermined pickup spot in that whole dead end area yeah bad mapping i think on this one they should allow both sides at least i thought it was going to get stuck but it blew me away with that reverse maneuver you and me i think that was the highlight of the entire video for me other than maybe choosing your pickupdrop off and just the general overall boring nature of the ride itself
317,why is teslas adaptive cruise control so bad considering the amount of data they harvest
318,well if nothing else well get our first real data on how safe these vehicles actually are albeit in limited scenarios it will be interesting to see if they report how frequently their mission control or whatever its called has to intervene as well exciting times
319,i dont know man maybe i agree routing will need to be flexible but i think well for sure lose some freedom pulling a random u y it just wont be as easy so it probably wont happen its the difference between saying i want to go that way and simply turning the wheel versus i want to go that way take out my phone pull up the app cancel current route confirm cancellation somehow draw out the new route pay fine for additional time in car etc im probably exaggerating the process but only to make the point dont get me wrong im still excited and want sdcs but i think we have to be honest with ourselves and recognize that well likely lose some ease and freedom of travel i dont see any way short of reading my mind that using a constantly monitored and controlled sdc will ever be as free as your own hands on the wheel but the trade off will be safer cheaper travel with big brother always watching and given that plus percent of the time im just going from a to b ill make that trade
320,police often drive their vehicles places that are not roads this requires manual drive an ambulance is much more than transportation to the hospital you and everyone who believes that manual drive will be completely eliminated just dont understand the real world there will always be a need for manual control of some vehicles that otherwise can operate autonomously most of the time for instance my friend is an electrician that works on municipal infrastructure some times he needs to drive his bucket truck up on to the sidewalk to be able to position his bucket lift so he can do his job automatition may get him to the site but he still needs to manually position his vehicle to do his job the same can be said for many different types of service vehicles
321,appropriately trained model if by that you mean a general ai at or above human intelligence then sure the fact is that in many cases vehicles are not simply a vessel for providing transportation their roles are wider and those roles preclude the elimination of manual control
322,first youre assuming self driving means it cant take direction from a human not at all youre also not considering other technological advances for example you could launch a drone to track a fleeing suspect irrelevant unless there is some kind of thought control a self driving car will not be able to be directed by a human as well as a human could manually drive it whether it is with a steering wheel joystick or some kind of virtual reality interface there will always be the necessity in certain vehicle roles that need manual control not that im sure why youd need one because this conversation started by someone suggesting that manual driving would cease to exist entirely
323,first youre assuming self driving means it cant take direction from a human not at all youre also not considering other technological advances for example you could launch a drone to track a fleeing suspect irrelevant unless there is some kind of thought control a self driving car will not be able to be directed by a human as well as a human could manually drive it whether it is with a steering wheel joystick or some kind of virtual reality interface there will always be the necessity in certain vehicle roles that need manual control not that im sure why youd need one because this conversation started by someone suggesting that manual driving would cease to exist entirely
324,i dont think it has to be this limited even way in the future very few cars can be manually driven today you can defeat some of the systems but even a lot of sports cars wont let you fully turn off traction control i could easily see a l vehicle where the steering brake and gas are processed as suggestions that the car has the complete ability to override so you can drive toward a wall at mph but at some point the car will put the brakes on and stop you from hitting it there would still be more risk because you can put the vehicle in a position that it wouldnt normally do that makes an accident more likely
325,not at all and yet in the example youve given it seems trivial for a human who can fully devote his attention to tracking a subject and giving voice commands to the vehicle can be more effective and much safer also while it may be a matter of semantics its possible for a vehicle to be self driven and still have a joystick or other interface for granular human control while the vehicle itself actual retains control and ensures safety because this conversation started by someone suggesting that manual driving would cease to exist entirely you didnt answer the question why do motorcycles need to exist lots of technology comes and goes as new technology takes over
326,very few cars can be manually driven today this is just a flat out lie unless we are in some alternate universe and very few actually mean practically all i could easily see a l vehicle where the steering brake and gas are processed as suggestions that has nothing to do with level the levels have to do with when the car can be autonomous not how much control the allow the driver
327,its possible for a vehicle to be self driven and still have a joystick or other interface for granular human control while the vehicle itself actual retains control and ensures safety no that is no longer autonomous why do motorcycles need to exist i didnt realize you were suggesting banning them how about this motorcycles need to exist becausewe have this thing called freedom where things arent outlawed just because they dont conveniently fit into your idea of how thing should be sdcs are supposed to give us more freedom not less and if your only solution to problems is to take away existing options you really dont deserve a place in the conversation
328,you are presuming a very elastic demand for personal vehicle ownership when plotted against the decreasing price of taxi services i didnt say anything about demand or market i just said that itd cost as much as owning a car taxis are uncertain you dont know what it is going to look like smell like sound like you dont know how long it will take to arrive or what it will cost for your trip or if one will even be available at all when you need it basically all of these things can be or already have been worked out uber type rating systems have ended dumpy dirty cabs pretty well and thatll be further improved with sdcs google vehicles look new basically at all times uber type cab apps also give you pricing well in advance and w flat per km rates youll pretty much know how much a trip costs without even looking just like you can with your own car availability isnt really an issue either if youre in a city i do think that cabs will take a long time to spread to rural areas for a large number of reasons but car ownership in a city over people should be silly for anyone but the wealthy within the next years taking the driver out of taxis changes nothing except the price of the taxi ride ah well it changes who has control google having power over cars vs cab owners google will certainly reduce prices further and give a very uniform experience like when mcdonalds created fast food and obliterated burger joints or megafarms obliterating tiny farms eliminating the driver cuts the price by rds corporate control cuts it in half or by rd again and increased usage drops prices further once the prices are competitive with the city bus youre talking about serious increases in usage it also creates a smoother safer ride and you dont have to deal with another person you still get privacy so you can sing bad music loudly still or sleep or watch tv without it being weird just like in your own car no conversation is expected and you could comfortably send your child alone in one unlike now no risk of getting scammed unlike now plus sdcs could come in more flavours atm you can get a regular cab a van moving trucks limos or buses with a bigger user base they could add tiny efficient vehicles for person they could have ones with beds ones with big screen tvs ones with vr sets some stocked with a bar or a vending machine and snacks if youre just napping on the way home fromto work then take the tiny seater at th the price of a normal car putting you well below bus prices take a high speed vehicle between cities to cut time if you set up an account then the service could remember your settings too for music and we you want if you live in a rural area and are wealthy you certainly will not use these very often maybe you can buy a bunch of vehicles but if you earn under k and live in the city you probably wont buy your own vehicle in a decade or so from now if you live in a town then maybe that line is more like k or k
329,once the prices are competitive with the city bus youre talking about serious increases in usage more traffic congestion ah well it changes who has control google having power over cars vs cab owners taxis are a very low return on invested capital no way is google going to run a taxi company except as part of rd as they like to say they are not inventing a car they are inventing a driver
330,i think they see uber and see that they could undercut that business model and are trying to get it into that market not to be argumentative but i think this is simply wrong the self driving taxis are a controlled beta testing environment not a business model for waymo or tesla waymo can say see we have the car of the future on the streets of phoenix today but they still own every car control every car and control the boundaries road conditions weather conditions and so on in which the vehicle operates money is not an object alphabet has over b just in cash equivalents the only business model they care about is owning and controlling the operating system of future sdcs that will be worth x whatever uber is worth
331,this isnt self driving cars its automatic lane keeping and radar cruise control
332,now heres the big question if the vehicle is under control of the ai and gets in an accident whos liable for the accident the owner or the company who created the ai who pays for the accident as far as im concerned it should not be the driver
333,we already have lane assist and adaptive cruise control on cars not sure how different this is
334,i tried that couldnt turn the steering wheel unless it was a rager
335,its has been used for years you can youtube plenty of teslas driving around the states themselves currently the law states for insurance purposes that a human must be ready to take control this isnt a new thing this has been around forever its just recently we have access to massive amounts of data to enable this kind of ai the year was no different waymo drove million miles in the state which is not even its primary testing ground its cars disengaged times for a rate of disengagements per miles thats down from in source latest self driving car statistics from california
336,no problem thats for being receptive to new information i should point out that disengagement in the above reports means when a human was prompted to take control of the vehicle but yeah just watching some videos on youtube will blow your mind especially look for the summon feature it will come and meet you at the front of the store so you dont have to walk to your parking spot again the biggest hurdle is public perception and in my eyes it has to be an all or nothing either all cars are self driving or none as humans and self driving cars really dont get along together
337,my opinion is that ditching these things too fast would greatly slow adoption of the technology theyre better off having people who own these cars think wow this technology is so good that i never touch the steering wheel anymore then start offering the car without it
338,this news doesnt mean all self driving cars will have no steering wheel just the ones where it makes sense cars specifically for city use cars ready for firms like uber etc
339,its so the steering wheel doesnt fly off
340,if i cant have a steering wheel i should at least be able to plug an xbox controller in a usb port or something
341,if i cant have a steering wheel i should at least be able to plug an xbox controller in a usb port or something
342,no thanks though self driving cars will eventually get stuck in a situation they cant get out of youll want to drive them at that point i can imagine that companies will see this need and invent driving your car with a cell phone as a replacement keep the steering wheel and ability to drive until self driving cars are near perfect in every situation note there are a ton of situations with say construction workers holding signs where unless self driving cars can communicate in visual language this wont work i dont want to be stuck in traffic because some self driving car doesnt know what to do in a situation and just parks in the middle of the road somewhere because it cant navigate a construction zone wont navigate around a stalled vehicle or because of a road closure and it cant follow a detour sign
343,all of the naysayers in this thread fail to see one thing autonomous vehicles will drastically reduce injury and death due to collisions k deaths and m injuries per year from car accidents in the us humans suck at driving the faster we take away all control from humans the more lives will be saved yes there will still be accidents yes the autonomous tech will fuck up and cause accidents yes cars will get hacked and fly off the road but with all of this considered tens of thousands of peoples lives will be saved every year
344,no steering wheel imgurcomgalleryhvoskfm
345,i bet they will have an overridemaintenance mode where you can plug in a game controller to steer with
346,this will result in three things i dont actually know enough about cars and how theyre built so the first of these points is my speculation feel free to correct me if im wrong the other two are big things though a higher price point and if this happens with one itll happen with all of them so that higher price point will translate to all self driving vehicles basically itll limit self driving vehicles to only people who are both well off financially and willing to pay that much for a car no steering wheel invites a lack of need to pay attention because why would you when you cant take control of it anyway so drivers will play games read fall asleep etc which is against the law at least where i live you need to keep your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road self steering or not this request has much bigger legal implications than you might think it does take away all manner of control so when that inevitable thing happens and the machine cant deal with it or maybe theres a system glitch of some sort the driver is helpeless and probably fucked

348,i go offloading and on paths that are not on google maps there are paths where i live that wouldnt be visible to a robot but are still drivable if there is no steering wheel how am i supposed to drive along these paths
349,this scares me like someone else having control over where your legs go arent people concerned that someday an evil leader will be able to strand whomever heshe wants
350,terrorists and government will love these self driving vehicles hack the software and you have a lethal remote controlled weapon
351,see now this is probably where id draw the line what if somebody hacks your car and drives you into a wall sadly no steering wheel there for you to save yourself
352,but if theyre test cars why bother test cars should have more controls not less
353,youre thinking about manually controlling it you could always tell if where to go im sure it would still have input somehow
354,they already have that adaptive cruise control plus lane assist basically makes it so you barely have to touch the steering wheel though its not at the level of true autonomy yet
355,they already have that adaptive cruise control plus lane assist basically makes it so you barely have to touch the steering wheel though its not at the level of true autonomy yet
356,maybe they could install a nonfunctional steering wheel like maggie simpsons toy
357,realistically if of the time the car is perfectly fine on its own the human brain will not be able to pay proper attention in an emergency situation where the human driver would need to take control there will very likely be up to a ten second or so delay because humans are not able to constantly pay attention to tasks that are not engaging they will be lost in thought or otherwise distracted anyway
358,i think it is inevitable that we lose control of the actual driving once self driving cars are widely used the thought of human controlled cars will be thought of as criminally negligent behavior or at least as bad as smoking in a restaurant i would be surprised if autonomous vehicles werent required by law once the benefits were understood
359,if theyre test cars that will only be used to test self driving capabilities why bother putting in a steering wheel is the point you dont spend more on a test of one thing than necessary
360,wait til they come out with a car that has no steering wheel but still has a lever for manual transmission the day of the auto manual automobile will be upon us
361,an xbox controller would work well enough if it is only needed very infrequently the whole machine is drive by wire anyway
362,i did ditching the steering wheel and pedals would create additional space and allow for more creatively designed interiors what part of that sounds like i missed anything
363,im not saying steering wheel less vehicles will never exist the infrastructure your describing doesnt exist you know what else doesnt exist full self driving cars that work in most conditions just that they shouldnt exist until maybe of all vehicles on the road are driving themselves fully and the data backs up the assumption that its not needed i dont buy the whole its only a test vehicle well a test vehicle can have a steering wheel
364,i read it theres no reason to consider removing them any time within the next decade what do you do in situations where theres an issue like freak hail breaks your lidar camera just stay there till youre towed to a shop the only reason to rush out steering wheels is hope to cause confidence in consumers and buyers but we currently can barely get autonomous cars with steering wheels to go driveway to driveway if theres rush construction going on worse in cases of black ice this is five ten years too early its a novelty that will result in stranded vehicles that need towed or people that could take over and move an autonomous bus which cant get through a situation on its own block all the petitions until the steering wheels are covered in dust and then work on this idea or the least case is irobot manual control override and out comes a hidden wheel and pedals

366,nah insurance cost is just like any other cost it will be baked into the price of the vehicles the auto companies will have great clout to drive insurance costs down and they wont have people in the loop to make their programming look bad there will still be steering wheels in some cars to give ppl the feeling that they are actually driving but a nanny will be there to take over when you fuck up
367,i honestly think itll take longer for steering wheels to be phased out even after self driving is a norm automation scares a lot of people and the lack of a manual override will make for easy demonization of self driving cars as weve already seen happen already
368,you might be missing my point adoption of this technology meaning customers buying it is more about psychology than tech for quite a few years initially a majority of people are going to be watching intently for news stories that say robot car kills occupants if it also says robot car kills helpless occupants who were unable to manually control vehicle and were screaming as it drove them off of a cliff the industry will be set back for a decade the early adopters risk takers are good but they arent enough to make this take hold not to mention there are people alive who just enjoy driving
369,there would for sure be a youtube video where someone tries to go from ny to la using nothing but a guitar hero controller
370,no i agree but your original position was that there were conditions self driving cars should never lose the steering wheel because the cars cant navigate those situations technology needs test cases to develop ways to adapt to those conditions and construction zones totally can be adapted around heavy snow or wind are not easily adapted to and will be harder to develop for the technology i described does exist currently its just not used in the real world because self driving cars are a fringe case construction companies are not planning for
371,self driving yes but what about shit construction zones and areas with little to no road consistency no steering wheel would be suicidal
372,because its really easy to name a ton of situations where self driving cars would get stuck no matter how good they are construction zones for instance or road closures there are so many instances where a self driving car would get stuck that it makes no sense to not have the ability to manually take control its bad enough having cars break down causing traffic backups imagine how many backups will be caused by a self driving car going well dont know what to do ill just stay here and wait for someone to i guess push me out of the way but wait can you even push the car if no one can steer it wait for a tow truck to tow it because its ai cant figure out the situation removing steering wheels is an idea way ahead of the curve of a technology that is in its infancy its the last thing that you will do not one of the first
373,because its really easy to name a ton of situations where self driving cars would get stuck no matter how good they are construction zones for instance or road closures there are so many instances where a self driving car would get stuck that it makes no sense to not have the ability to manually take control its bad enough having cars break down causing traffic backups imagine how many backups will be caused by a self driving car going well dont know what to do ill just stay here and wait for someone to i guess push me out of the way but wait can you even push the car if no one can steer it wait for a tow truck to tow it because its ai cant figure out the situation removing steering wheels is an idea way ahead of the curve of a technology that is in its infancy its the last thing that you will do not one of the first
374,not to mention nothing in the article states a car without a steering wheel costs less in the short term that person is just speculating and probably incorrectly if these arent being built in mass
375,and weve been working on a lot of problems for exceedingly long periods of time that have been solved in the last decade doesnt mean theyll never be solved planes are also a very different problem you could make the argument in the opposite direction then weve had plane autopilots for a long time why is automatic cars taking so long i agree with you in principle i too would not give up my steering wheel for edge cases the problem is the other parts of your comment by implying that they cant take away steering wheels ever because theyre never solve that problem we arent even at the stage where self driving is default complaining about the lesser problems it cant solve yet is silly when all the big problems are still in process
376,grandpa isnt buying this anyway i want a car with no steering wheel or concept of a drivers seat so the car can be laid out more like a room than the inside of yet another car
377,because its really easy to name a ton of situations where self driving cars would get stuck no matter how good they are yes and then you need to test those situations to determine if why and exactly how the automation fails and how best to intervene if the end goal is for the steering wheel is to be used so infrequently it becomes vestigial
378,theres never going to be widespread private ownership by the time something without a steering wheel is road legal why would you own something horribly expensive that would just sit around of the time when a subscription will be just as readily available at a fraction of the cost
379,why is that better than a normal one if it is why not just allow that for all cars cyber truck had a cool looking but likely not legal steering wheel i think the idea is consistency between vehicles so people dont have a learning curve to driving between cars
380,it is literally a lesser problem because it doesnt affect every driver all the time but still im not arguing that we should ignore the problem im saying that focusing on that problem as the reason we cant do without steering wheels ever is wrong youre good at finding all the details in your argument but ignoring them in mine honestly were still very far from true autonomous driving for a lot of reasons the biggest one being infrastructure we cant predict what the state of self driving tech will be when worrying about the weather becomes one of the big problems they move on to for all we know itll be a non issue that ends up solved by accident as a result of solving a different problem or implementing a new system i guess thats my point the snow problem for a fraction of users for a fraction of the year is not a today problem so we cant look at todays tech to point out why it cant be solved once we solve todays problems well use tomorrows tech to evaluate tomorrows problems hypothetical we end up developing some advanced sensorai system able to navigate unknown routes without needing to reference preset maps and navigation data letting people take side roads and even travel off road then they discover that routine is also able to dynamically update existing navigational data when the system detects unexpected road conditions like snow or road construction no need for a special snow sub system
381,i have a wild suspicion that they may be planning to move to fully autonomous vehicles with no steering wheel
382,the a senior software dev at a top software company i have also been qa for some of the time if anything everyone is vastly underestimating the dates problems and scenarios am i worried self driving cars will remove jobs yes but not for years even if self driving was perfect today it would take years to get reasonable market penetration example the first prius which was crazy popular came out in thats years ago electric cars today make up less than of cars sold self driving will take a similar road map to electric cars as they both add an additional cost to vehicles right now i would argue full self driving cars arent even at the first prius point which really only got like mpg and was pretty weak today at the consumer level we only have glorified cruise control and some cool tech and test vehicles that drive by themselves with humans monitoring them no fully automatic driving at a consumer level the first vehicles to go full ai will be long haul truckers because its the simplest problem to solve freeway only driving we dont have this yet working at a good enough level and this isnt even accounting for the politics of it its way to early to be talking about removing steering wheels

384,backing up and parking big rigs is probably one of the most complicated driving tasks i see manual controls in every cab because switching trailers from a self driving cab to a manual one wont be feasible not to say there will be a human in every cab at all times
385,and have a human drive from there thats what they need the steering wheel for
386,people person the problem is a person who keeps over promising about the kind of automation the cars he sells are capable of his words convey that the cars drive themselves not that they have lane assist and adaptive cruise control that they are a fully functional driver its a fraudulent lie and he gets away with it because he is rich
387,sure as long as that doesnt lead to no way to drive no wheel no gas pedal maybe a bunch of keyboard commands from a book press control s to slow down kind of thing i mean you cant get a stick anywhere anymore not that its necessary any base line tesla can smoke almost every other internal combustion car on the planet but you get the point
388,have you driven modern tesla it can be janky but it is capable of driving itself and more than lane assist and cruise control stopping and going at lights can fully drive its self on main roads handle stop and go etc it needs input when turning if there are no lines and requires you to hit the gas at a stop sign but besides that it works and is only getting better but guess what nobody is saying the car fully drives itself if you abuse the autopilot it will get deactivated for the rest of your drive teslas autopilot has also saved countless lives you just never see those stories
389,rtos that control machines aircraft etc are nothing like a pc
390,i want one people need it if people cant lock onto a speed limit themselves then they obviously need it too traffic laws are too simple if people cant follow them as is then what other options are there to ensure the laws dont get broken not to mention how much more sustainable it would be and for monitoring emissions and fuel usages people want to drive but we cant seem to prove we deserve it if we cant even cruise control the speed limit
391,yes but most no longer ride horses people in control of one ton of moving steel no longer able to control it properly should something happen is a little more worrying no
392,declare yourself the fat controller and theyll just do as theyre told
393,this is the main differentiator of level and above at that point the car is in control and the car is responsible tesla fsd is probably close to level but for legal purposes it will still be considered level thats why i dont get arguments when people say tesla is only level just like xxx where xxx is a basic adaptive cruise control in most cars adaptive cruise control is not the same as tesla fsd even though they are both level
394,so you want self driving to control other drivers never thought of that angle
395,if self driving cars achieve an equal or better safety record than the average human then no i dont see why the occupants of a self driving car should be prepared to assume control any more than train passengers are people get killed every day on the roads but we consider that an acceptable risk due to the relative infrequency and benefit to society that cars provide self driving vehicles are no different in fact humans do a pretty shitty job of driving on average so from an ethical standpoint we should feel compelled to get them out of the driving seat crashstatsnhtsadotgovapipublicviewpublication
396,let me clarify tesla is not saying the car can fully drive itself input is needed however it is still far more than cruise control and lane assist my other points still stand as well have you driven a modern tesla before
397,no no ists not perception and prediction tasks yes anything else is a lot of optimization and higher control theory take eg the local trajectory planning and risk calculation thats simple mathematics these need no ais also behause they are hardly to train as to the best of my knowledge no unbiased data exists to train sich networks but yes the data on which algorithms further down the self driving car pipeline operate are applied and will most lilely always be results of ais
398,a dirty camera means theres no input image that didnt have anything to do with adversarial attacks lol same with fog and blizzard adversarial image attacks are literally just the original image with noise added in feel free to review the research to refresh your memory an ml system ultimately needs to be able to think like a human because were not going to be able to train every situation and the public isnt going to want to get into a car they have no control over if they think its going to kill them when weather conditions arent as favorable as the weather the car was trained in it seems rather ethically dubious to widely release a technology with such glaring issues inherent to the very system the tech is built on
399,just the original image with noise not just any noise youre the one who needs to refresh your memory a dirty camera means theres no input image so if all the cameras somehow became dirty you slow down stop hand off controls to the driver ive been driving tesla for a while now and none of the cameras needed any cleaning yet let alone being completely blind all of them at the same time youre truly grasping at straws here an ml system ultimately needs to be able to think like a human no it doesnt were not going to be able to train every situation thats not how it works modern neural nets compress and generalize knowledge you dont need to train it on literally every road in the world to be useful and the public isnt going to want to get into a car they have no control over if they think its going to kill them again youre making obviously false claims teslas fsd alone has k drivers using it and how many of them have died because of fsd it seems rather ethically dubious to widely release a technology with such glaring issues you have no problem with regular cars that are driven by humans who regularly get drunk get high look at their smartphones text pass out due to health problems dont pay attention somehow you ignore these glaring issues thousand deaths per year in the us alone data and you know why because you accept a certain level of risk just like everyone else
400,its not really a trolley problem though because there are other options most of us would happily damage property over killing someone in practice we might even accept some risk of injury to ourselves if the net outcome is better the typical human responses arent even illogical per se just choosing from the best options based on limited data and processing time we simply dont know enough to make an optimal decision braking often isnt a good option because you could cause a multi car pileup that results in more injury andor death and still not save the pedestrian from life threatening injuries it only works for self driving cars if they have absolute control over themselves and work with each other well
401,okaybut haywire is pretty hyperbolic what mine did i fsded to a park about miles away all worked just fine i parked at the park for a half hour or so on the way home the car kept alerting for a forward collision warning and i couldnt use fsd or cruise control so literally all i did was turn off the warnings then drive home like a muggle no fsd no ap no cruise control i really dont think that is haywire also im pretty sure it only impacted fsd beta people and the fsd beta acknowledgements i accepted stated very clearly that something like this could happen i should be careful so i was careful and it was fine
402,this is why it is rolled out to the top rated drivers before anyone else that is the testing phase and where it was caught drivers at this level have complete control over the vehicle at all time and are able to quickly take over if the ai does something strange if you have an issue with their test make sure you at least know how they test tesla self driving mode as it sits safer than your average driver
403,most likely not communicating to average joe that its actually only test software it literally tells you it is in testing and that you the driver must maintain control at all times
404,using owners as your test platform is sloppy at best they can validate your testing when done in a controlled environment when they are informed that they are participating in a test rolling out an automatic update and triaging the results is incredibly irresponsible when the context is a machine that can kill someone when it operates knowing how they test doesnt make it any less sloppy
405,even if youre correct that they all have full complete control which is doubtful tesla is testing beta software on public roads that means everybody on those public roads is a beta tester whether they know it or not to my knowledge other car manufacturers arent allow to do this
406,true as that may be theyre hard to avoid for anything more than short local trips especially if youre driving alone using a dash mounted smartphone with a map app or the cars touchscreen navigation is pretty much a given voice commands help but can only go so far and maps are too complex to be used with steering wheel controls which is why autonomous driving is so important that said autonomous cars should probably happen by way of government infrastructure investments to make the roads autonomy friendly but good luck getting that through the senate
407,true as that may be theyre hard to avoid for anything more than short local trips especially if youre driving alone using a dash mounted smartphone with a map app or the cars touchscreen navigation is pretty much a given voice commands help but can only go so far and maps are too complex to be used with steering wheel controls which is why autonomous driving is so important that said autonomous cars should probably happen by way of government infrastructure investments to make the roads autonomy friendly but good luck getting that through the senate
408,in the fsd beta program you are in full control of the vehicle and you are to expect interventions often as the program improves this is made extremely clear before youre allowed into the program you are responsible for not taking over if your car does something stupid which it will the car will often do the wrong thing at the worst possible time is how its written in the agreement
409,this is nonsense do you freak out when someone is using cruise control do you even understand how the fsd works it requires the driver to pay attention with their hands touching the wheel at all times private beta means only a select group of people are allowed to use it how the hell are you supposed to test self driving feature on a private road the software issue was fixed the same day this entire story is a nothingburger
410,would you rather be on the road with a properly licensed regulated responsible driver who is not just half assed tested once in his entire life back in the teen years and in a society where we dont pressure people into driving when tired and give people ample cheap public transportation and remove unfair stigmas against it so they can use alternate transportation when needed or let technology we dont even trust to run our dumb little phones correctly do something as important and mission critical as drive a car something that not only can potentially endanger the passenger but people in other cars and property around them regulation and change has to happen technology isnt the solution to everything since technology isnt perfect and can potentially be far more dangerous than a distracted driver our over reliance on technology has gotten us into a world full of anti privacy and anti freedom as well as so many other things that has dehumanized us to a point where we are essentially a slave to it technology has to be a tool not a means to an end we cannot allow automated driving to exist as it would cause so many more issues than it would solve as well as further erode privacy and freedom yes humans driving are problematic but solving that issue by doing common sense things to help our society eliminate a large number of these problems is a far better solution than further enslaving ourselves to repressive big brother technology im a lifelong sysadmin and programmer ask anyone like me and theyll say the same dont let technology run our lives its not anti technology its anti control and technology isnt reliable or secure enough in any situation to allow it bugs and hacks will happen and theres no way to safeguard it
411,and not under the control of engineers who understand the changes but rather unleashed on customers who are blindly unaware of how the system works and who are being forced to bear the risks of an underdeveloped system
412,i am under no impression that fsd is perfect or even good but the bar is pretty low for exceeding human capability lets do some quick math the fatality rate for human drivers is deaths per million miles traveled statisticsdetailstate by state tesla has about million cars with autopilot on the road cleantechnicacomover tesla vehicles with autopilot on the road the average driver drives miles per week cut our driving in half is it time for pay per mile insurance shbadaad so telsa drivers alone are collectively averaging million miles per week this means that even if the tesla autopilot got into a fatal accident once a week every single week that fatality rate would be more than twice as safe as human drivers i think you severely overestimate what it takes to be better than the average driver and just perceive a higher risk because its a loss of control not cause its actually riskier
413,i dont know it slows when it sees emergency lights and beeps for you to take control isnt that better than a human driver texting and not paying any attention at all
414,use car crashes to control population sizes so you have less people on the road and the cars have an easier time navigating with less obstacles
415,agreed thats why i mentioned a controlled environment public roads are not a controlled environment
416,i dont agree that haywire or calamity as another on this thread called it is remotely appropriate if you imagine a perfect drive buggy software seems imperfect but humans dont have perfect drives die every year in the us alone add to that the number of injured and the billions in financial damages and you have the true real world baseline for current driving so does a beta software released to s of specifically safe drivers all of whom have been told that the software will likely make bad choices at the worst time qualify as going haywire when it randomly hits the brakes hell no the user can take control instantly the user is supposed to be paying attention they are holding the wheel they are warned in advance the user is selected from a small group of humans specifically based on their ability to consistently drive safe predictably and smooth the situation is far less dangerous than a squirrel running across the road in front of a regular driver is a squirrel crossing the road in front of a car indicative of a super dangerous situation would you have told your friends your drive went haywire on the way home if that happened of course not you probably wouldnt have told anyone because its not newsworthy just like this whole post
417,it certainly cost the life of a family friend of mine witnesses said he lost control of his tesla that then drove head first into a tree at mph exploded instantly
418,nothing about this requires a certification in automotive safety its click bait tesla did a beta test to a controlled group of cars and instantly reverted the software when they werent happy with user reports of invalid collision warnings the actual facts make this story a positive for tesla it shows they arent taking risks inside their beta program
419,yes if a human driver hits another human driver i suggest we ban them from driving as their algorithm is broken and should not be aloud to guide cars we dont do that though we look at the situation and we dont generally punish people for accidents if the driver was negligent theres jail time but if someone happened to dive in the drivers path at the last minute the driver is not at fault have to look at the issue beside we do regulate human drivers its called a drivers license yes and this applies here use of teslas autopilot in the road currently requires a licensed driver thats the regulatory rule take something like adaptive cruise control a common feature in many of the current cars if theres a problem with it and the car doesnt slow down as a result of the car in front of you the driver is expected to brake himself you wouldnt expect the feature of adaptive cruise control to be banned if theres a problem with it in a ford model youd expect ford to recall it and fix it if theres an accident as a result of it unless the bug was one that prevented the human from overriding the adaptive cruise control youd expect the driver to be punished the more advanced features of the tesla should fall in the same category as long as the regulation is that a licensed driver is required on the wheel the licensed driver has responsibility if autopilot kills someone and the driver didnt disengage the autopilot that driver should be punished and tesla is expected to recall the feature and fix it unless the bug is such that it prevented the driver from disengaging autopilot in which case tesla should be criminally responsible for negligence
420,i highly recommend test driving a model s tesla with auto driving it was so incredible i just kept thinking how is elon so far ahead of everyone else and why doesnt every car have this its not just self driving as if you can take a nap its the fact that the steering wheel and throttle and brakes gently nudge the car keeping it in the center of the lane and a safe distance back which is so much nicer in crowded driving conditions
421,i think theres actually going to be a huge problem with self driving cars in the works of the time state its really easy to tell a human that they have to pay attention and be responsible for the vehicle at all times but have you met humans they are terrible as stand by operators if they arent actively controlling the vehicle they will not be ready to take over at a moments notice they will not be watching the road and remaining vigilant at all times
422,thats the problem if the safety failsafe involves the driver taking control at a split second we have a problem
423,there have been instances of this where for example the bicycle is running the red light the google car sees it coming and stops for it while its still several lanes away the operator is about to take control because all the other lanes start moving and then everyone else hits the brakes as the bike weaves through the traffic
424,right as long as they can continue to tap the consumer directly thats my point even if it makes no sense at all for the individual to carry insurance because the no longer have any control over the vehicle the insurance companies will lobby to keep these laws in place if they can maintain the illusion of personal responsibility they can keep charging individuals who have little bargaining power on prices compared to google ford uber etc instead of the companies who produce the self driving cars and actually have more control over their performance on the road
425,by the time the majority of people are pushing their electes representatives to get the dangerous human drivers off the streets driving will be a sport activity for certain times and places like ultralight aircraft and snowmobiling and cars will have a take control mode that will let you drive but always be ready to step in and save the day if you appear to be fucking up
426,the person behind the wheel currently you are still responsible for being able to take control at any moment
427,my prediction is that we will move towards cars as a service you lease a car from alphabetteslawhatever that chinese one is for years so they have all rights to the programming and you cant modify the vehicle they will also want control over how often its maintained and so they can demand the sensors be repaired with this lease some will just throw in the insurance because itll be cheap and marketingaccounting will say its a good deal for us
428,umm automated lane control and auto braking have been saving people from crashes for a couple years now with excellent dash cam videos of the events shared on reddit regularly i agree it wont magically save you after the car is already out of control but if you arent braking when you should be or you are going straight when the road is curving you can definitely be saved by the machine
429,i think what they mean is that premiums will go up for those choosing to control and drive their own cars because they arent going to be as safe on the road for and compared to other drivers wholl be riding in self driving cars and not controlling them so because self driving cars are safer premiums will go up for those who choose to drive themselves
430,people prefer to be in control and result in the death of people than let a robot be in control and potentially kill if a driver kills its an accident if a robot kills its bad programming and intended its going to be a long time until people accept the new av paradigm as safer and even if right now many people already know that they are safer they will still dont release the wheel
431,i think the main barrier to the introduction of self driving cars is the perceived loss of control drivings gives us the feeling of being in charge of course its an illusion your survival during your trip depends on a thousand other drivers doing the right thing still its a powerful illusion
432,also note that in most countries cars kill more people than guns every major car accident should have news outlets calling for driverless cars just like they call for more gun control with each mass shooting
433,because it can go from fair driving conditions to utter shit in the matter of minutes as someone very familiar with severe winter driving conditions there is no mystery when there is a risk of what you describe during those times people could retain manual control of their vehicles are some people stupid about driving in poor conditions of course we see them all the time and they often seem to be people with vehicles with awd who seem to think awd gives them superpowers when driving in winter conditions at any rate the fact that there may be extreme conditions in which autonomous vehicles wont function is no reason not to deploy them in less extreme conditions
434,people could retain manual control of their vehicles if you dont practice driving regularly your driving skills go to shit this is exactly why people complain about sunday drivers
435,i understand your perspective but already most people cant respond appropriately in a vehicular emergency because they never practice emergency driving most people dont know how to brake effectively control a skidding vehicle or maneuver in an emergency the notion that people have driving skills beyond the most rudimentary basics is not true in most cases
436,i think these have great potential for carshare providers like zipcar in the not too distant term right now zipcar service typically only pencils out in the densest parts of an urban area imagine instead a zipcar that can drive itself a short distance to be where you reserved it and as more people move to an on demand model of car ownership that will mean people can start thinking of cars less as an all you can eat buffet and more like a pay as you go service those people who can move to this model will save gobs of money personally and save some of the broader social costs of everyone owning private vehicles acceptance of more exotic applications like the robotic taxicab will come later the carshare model still allows people to be in control while they are in the vehicle once people see that their reserved vehicle shows up unscathed maybe acceptance for the taxi model will happen quickly quick side note taxi drivers often pay enormous amounts over k in some areas http for their license to operate be prepared for these individuals to flip their shit if they start competing head to head with google more likely is that the taxi industry will start lobbying hard
437,some news websites thats the idea our research shows that people cant stand pop ups they also hate being told they cant do things they normally used to be able to its a control thing that people normally cant stand so our new business model is to do all of those things even when people can find the news stories were putting out on other news sites xb someone in the office that no one respects wait but wont that piss people off so much that instead of paying hostage prices for the news theyll get it from somewhere else xb ceos throws that person out of a window anybody else got any bright fucking ideas no didnt think so
438,first and foremost its something of a logical fallacy yes on average self driving cars have a lower accident rate but if youre a safe driver you might have a lower accident rate than a self driving car also you have control over how safely you drive whereas in a self driving car youre not in control of the risk factors tesla is known for covering up high profile crashes with their autopilot system you can read more on that if youre interested
439,why would it not be on that side bmw a german brand makes left wheeled cars russia is a right driving country which means the steering wheel would be on the left since the driver side in the car is opposite to the driving side on the roadi have no idea what the confusion is
440,bad recommendation these are tools with semi autonomous assistive features there is no way to concretely prove they can operate fully autonomously in every street and every situation maybe if all cars were autonomous in conjunction with infrastructure that would simplify the process and better ensure processes eg smart highways that communicate with autonomous vehicles to space them correctly in accordance with conditions and speed limits etc but frankly at this point the only thing that could reasonably be blamed is features like auto park or auto return where the car operates intentionally without the input of any passengers rather than until the passenger re takes control
441,since all current systems can be over ridden by the driver i think this will only increase the push to remove the steering wheel and pedals otherwise well see cases of suicide by car in the hope of a payout for the family from ford or whoever
442,thats legally already the case i reckon depending on what controlmonitoring the user has to input to the situation
443,its not just ethically who is in control but given that everybody with a self driving car will need to buy insurance then its one of the most cost effective ways for owners of self driving cars to take out insurance who is going to get the better deal a billion pound car manufacturer or you on your phone to somebody who is reading a script they likely have zero legal training to understand and even if they did theyre employed to rip you off in the ideal world the government would be in charge of taking our insurance policies for us all because we have a democratic say in what that decision they make but the second best option is for the car manufacturers
444,here in the usa we had a case where one of the people in one of these self driving cars was basically thrown under the bus by the car company saying it was their fault it was really sad the person who was the test driver was a trans woman and had multiple felonies for various non violent things obviously this person struggled a lot in their life and got this job of being a test driver because there really didnt need to be any qualifications all they did was sit in the drivers seat and they were to intervene and take manual control of the car if something went wrong xb well this poor person was arrested thrown in jail and slandered after some crackhead basically ran themself into the car effectively killing themself the car company forget the name i think it was waymo blamed it all on this poor person saying they should have been paying attention and steered away they had video from inside the car of course and the tester was just sitting there playing on their phone when suddenly out of the blue comes some person on a bike straight into the car this happened so fast it was pretty much two seconds from when the camera sees the person on the bike to the impact this also happened at night so it is unlikely the test driver even if they werent staring at their phone would have seen much less been able to anticipate thebike riders actions not to mention the car had the headlights on and could clearly be seen yet the bike rider still drove immediately in front of them which to me seemed to indicate they probably werent perceptually aware enough to understand the vehicle was closer than they were thinking it was xb long story short the test driver was sent to jail for manslaughter and nothing happened to the company they took no responsibility
445,it might be obvious if the cars were always self driving the problem is that at the moment they are only partly so and that will probably continue for a long time this means that the car will hand control over to the user at times and may do so at short notice when the user is not paying attention if a crash results is that going to be legally the fault of the user or of the company which designed the car which handed over control while the user was pouring coffee if the company goes out of business must any cars of that brand be taken off the road despite a good safety record i can see the arguments for holding the company entirely responsible and i used to take this line now i think that it cant be simplified that much
446,is this in the uk im surprised because in level it would have to be argued that the driver could reasonably taken back control so if it accelerates to mph then says you sort it out just before a sharp turn i wouldnt say driver blame could apply
447,the car would be able to record if someone took control of the car before an accident all that telemetry can be analysed
448,you make good points and this really highlights how far away from actual self driving cars we are elon musk has spent years selling us this idea when all theyve got is cruise control that can follow lanes and even if we had the technology for cars to drive themselves were still years from resolving the ethical issues
449,is that going to be legally the fault of the user or of the company which designed the car which handed over control while the user was pouring coffee this isnt what current semi autonomous vehicles are meant for as much as i think the tech is dangerous i cant really blame the manufacturer when people fail to follow what is legally required of them if the company goes out of business must any cars of that brand be taken off the road despite a good safety record i can see manufacturers being required to have insurance covering this or for all of them to pay into a single pot to cover it
450,it does not matter if the car takes control from the driver then the company is responsible the same way that i would be responsible if i grabbed the wheel from you on the m and steered into the middle lane either the driver is in control or the driver is not if companies want to backpedal on how advanced their self driving actually is then they are free to do so but that should not absolve them of responsibility for their actions
451,any car that needs to hand control over to the user at times is not self driving and in my opinion out right dangerous people are going to be in the backseat snorting cocaine off a strippers tits do you expect them to be able to jump in and catch the car when it fucks up no either make a car that self drives or dont this half way house is going to cost lives even if its because the driver is only half driving and not fully aware
452,true thats the other option the car manufacturers will absolute write the correct data to the hard drive showing if the driver took over control like they absolutely had their chips take the right anti pollution actions even when no one was looking amazingly turns out its always the drivers fault
453,fully charged has a good episode this week there are claimed level self driving vehicles now operating in china teslas are level requiring constant attention from the driver level allows the driver to take her eyes off the road but be ready to take over if the car gets stuck level must transfer control in a safe way level will do everything and might not need driver controls but is restricted to certain suitable roads level can basically do anything a human driver can do youtuberpjxtqs i remain a little sceptical even if a computer can handle any normal driving event what about when a bouncy castle suddenly blows over the roundabout edit i tweaked my explanation of the self driving levels as i read the law society report pdf s eu west amazonawscomlawcom prod storage jsxouuyquploadsautomated vehicles joint report cvr pdf
454,teslas specifically detect where a crash might occur such as people pulling out on them and transfer control back to the user seconds before impact occurs even if the driver cant make any reasonable steps to prevent collision in these cases this way elon can proudly announce that the car was under the control of the driver when it crashed its a bit like disney world banning doctors and coroners from the parks so that the beheaded accident victims can be legally declared dead off site
455,im not sure personally i find that cruise control does add benefit even on a motorcycle and i can see cruise control with distance keeping being better i really dont like some other semi automatic interventions such as lane keeping and brake assistance in fact i got hit from behind when a car wouldnt let me back off the brakes this makes me a bit sceptical about self driving cars but ive not tried the most advanced semi autonomous versions like the tesla system
456,not that simple yes a self driving car can dump an emergency in your lap conversely it will routinely hand over control in non emergency situations such as minor roads and equally routinely take control in emergency situations such as using proximity to trigger the brakes there are all sorts of edge cases
457,then you need to look up what a self driving car actually is if your car has cruise control its a level self driving car and has literally the same result crash textawomancrashedhernewtimewhentheaccidenthappened drivers need to learn how to use the tools their vehicles come with responsibly
458,well at the moment the companies say that the driver is at fault regardless of what happens as theyre supposed to keep a hand on the wheel at all time to maintain control but like anything else it will be a case by case analysis and will depend entirely on individual circumstances there is no one size fits all when it comes to determining what happened during a car crash
459,a level self driving car will not just dump an emergency in your lap it must transfer control in a safe way so for example might stop on a dirt track and require the occupant to take over if a level car is on a motorway and there is a crash ahead it will take evasive action otherwise its level
460,yes but with cruise control im focused hands on the wheel paying absolute attention its just a driver aid its not actually driving for me when the car starts speeding up slowing down steering turning changing lanes etc youre not actually in control of the car any more youre sat there twiddling your thumbs which begs the question of what is the point if you need to pay attention and also if i know people and i do because i am people then this means whoever is there is not going to be paying anywhere near as much attention as someone who is actually driving its not possible to be as focused on whole task that youre not actually performing yourself a passenger is not as focused as a driver when you take away the stimulation people are less focused and if the car then suddenly needs to hand control back because its a half finished self drive then the driver isnt going to be on the ball sorry but i stand by my point self drive without the driver or dont bother driving aids like cruise control are fine but self driving tech like this either needs to be all or nothing
461,absolutely there is its a driving aid similar to cruise control just because cruise control cant do it all doesnt mean its not useful
462,i think ultimately these responsibilities will delay the fully automated driving with these companies just trying to avoid that potential liability and we will end up with a lot of cars that could be classified as level but still retaining human controls to avoid the manufacturer taking that leap im not sure whats best a lot of drivers are already driving distracted so it may end up making things much safer even if its not ideal
463,im picturing at least a decade of heavily implying the car can drive itself without any input maybe even having controls that can be hidden away for extra space while parked or some nonsense but are expected to be manually brought out whenever youre planning to drive the car
464,i dont know if there is a change of view they would have to retrofit lidar to all their cars if so the graphics i have seen of a teslas view of the roads look as impressive as those of waymo or baidhu that said i am just a little sceptical that anyone has managed to overcome the problem of a car driving at level able to deal with any ordinary driving occurrence but it needs to be able to safely transfer control with extreme reliability when something outside its experience happens
465,those cars pose a risk to the fabric of society not conceived of in modern times the insurance companies are not going anywhere a bunch of monopolistic hopefuls these orwellian companies that work on this tech represent these cars on a highway at high speeds represents an unfathomable level of damage that could be done why is this tech not sold as human augmentation as to help drivers do their job better or not dui its sold as a complete replacement theres no middle level where humans have this tech available to increase performance that shows the intent of these evil companies they want monopolies and to control transport just like the taxi companies did just in a new package that has a technological moat around it that whole industry is a metastasizing virtual tumor for the future to deal with
466,thank you i get really annoyed at how much the trolley problem gets brought up i dont think it is really relevant at all the sdv will simply try to avoid hitting anything or getting in any kind of accident by being able to look in all directions never lose attention and constantly be trying to predict the path and behavior of everything around them they should be able to avoid most bad situations long before they have gotten to the point where some intractable eitheror moral judgement needs to be made besides i kinda doubt in the world of human drivers theres too often that you are realistically put into a trolley problem type scenario in the first place again you dont think oh im going to hit those nuns or that group of school children better make up my mind you think oh shit im out of control can i at least try and miss those groups of people
467,all level manufacturers will do this theres no other way it could go first of all a no one wants to be liable for something they have no control over killing someone and b someone will definitely do it case in point and so everyone else will have to to compete
468,its hard to see it ending up any other way at least for fully autonomous cars however when they actually start selling these cars to consumers there are likely to be some catches they havent mentioned yet first if you have a car with a full manual mode ie one where the human is in ultimate control and wont be overridden your obviously not going to be covered by the manufacturer when your in that mode during the transition back to computer driving you also wont be covered for some amount of time to make sure that you didnt put the computer in a situation it cant recover from as a result of your manual control the second major limitation is that there will be strict maintenance requirements possibly even a maintenance contract that you pay in advance and the car will go get itself fixed by an authorized manufacturer approved mechanic likely at a dealership when it decides it needs something fixed even if there is no contract failure to get a problem fixed going to an unapproved mechanic or fixing something yourself may all suspend the manufacturers automatic assumption of liability they may still be liable but they will want the chance to investigate and if necessary disclaim liability it the accident was really the fault of poor repair work unapproved modifications will likewise void coverage
469,i really dont see that its a meaningful difference lets be honest the end customer is paying for it one way or the other the only difference is whether you write the check when you buy the car or you write the check every month its a technicality people spend way too much time worrying about its no different than if you have a limo and a personal driver today youre paying the insurance somebodysomething else is in control the only difference is in the case of a self driving car youre paying way way less for both the driver and the insurance
470,during the transition back to computer driving you also wont be covered for some amount of time to make sure that you didnt put the computer in a situation it cant recover from as a result of your manual control and what if it is the other way and the car puts you in charge in an emergency situation and you dont have the time or the ability to recover the idea of those transitional phases must die before anybody implements it
471,im talking here about the opposite the car being already engaged in auto mode and detecting it cant continue to handle the situation how does it return control to the driver instantly after a couple of seconds it just stops on itself
472,the trolley problem really only works with trolleys where you have a loooong time to make a decision that really only has two or three options the real world of driving is nothing like this and accidents only occur once you are already fundamentally out of control problem teach self driving car engineers
473,surely the catch all solution would be to stay in your lane and brake depending on how fast youre going this could hurt the passenger although i agree that its probably easiest to control the safety inside of the car and make external decisions based on what improves safety outside the car why would there be time to swerve if there isnt time to brake because you keep going forward even when you brake even if you were to immediately crush the wheel by pressing relentlessly hard on it the wheels arent attached to the road so its still going to skid the idea of swerving is to redirect that momentum at a safer target that said some of these trolley problems are kind of contrived city and town roads are rated for their safest possible speed so its on par with your hair dryer burning your house down yeah technically both can happen but its so rare that we dont really plan society around it youd only run into trolley problem stuff going highway speeds but those are typically inaccessible to pedestrians and graded to maximize visibility the more likely dilemma is probably is it better to swerve into this other car right now drive off the highway or let this other car hit me which would likely send me into this other car anyways the answer is probably deploy airbags and drive off highway but i actually dont know that one but thats a little harder to visualize so people go with the pedestrian example
474,accidents only occur once you are already fundamentally out of control plenty of accidents occur when someone else is out of control and a machine that can sense all relative velocities almost instantly and can make a proper decision in milliseconds can often avoid interacting with the out of control car with careful calculated in control response
475,this is what everyone thinks would happen in a world of avs and maybe somewhere in the distant future but its not really true all the sensor readings and perception outputs have error bars associated with them the pipeline to make decisions has significantly more latency than milliseconds i think most systems run at about hz so at least ms could be more latency behind it even if it can tick though and then you have to assume perfect understanding perfect prediction which is limited by not knowing how other users will respond its not possible to be accurate and perfect control control is actually probably one of the better parts machine control has proven very accurate and to have quick responses but that makes sense because its not bound by some cluster of gpus trying to do inference
476,there are other ethical situations where the pedestrian isnt at fault what if a car coming the opposite way swerves right in front of you at the last second your self driving car can brake all it wants but it may have to swerve in order to avoid the collision now what if there are pedestrians on the sidewalk of the road what would probably happen in that situation is that the car will allow the collision to happen since cars are designed for hitting each other and there would be nothing to protect swerving into the pedestrians that seems like the logical choice but there is another argument to be made too should the car protect the driver at all costs the driver is surrendering themselves and giving all trust and control in this car would it be ethical for it to allow the driver to be hurt over other people who arent involved with the car the reason people are talking about these hypothetical situations is because they will have to be decided before the situation becomes a reality these conditions will have to be explicitly set in the rules logic this isnt an area where we can say well see what happens these kind of decisions will have to be explicitly laid out and i think thats what people get hung up on a programmer will have to sit down and make the decision let my driver get hurt let the other driver get hurt let the bystanders get hurt an irobot model can even be applied where collision avoidance is based on a statistical survival model
477,second the answer is simple you hit the child you apply the brakes as much as you can you keep the car straight so the brakes are effective you mitigate the damage as best you can in most situations like this veering around the road isnt a great idea it leads to a loss of traction and very possibly a loss of control just nail the brakes let the computers abs etc stop the wheels from locking
478,swerving almost always makes it worse just watch some dash cam videos see how many would be avoided if one car simply kept going straight and would have missed the other car all together most of these scary situations are irrelevant with sdcs here is why you are still thinking of an sdc a true sdc as being a solitary computer controlling a solitary car like you driving your car this is not how it would work first you can only see one very small thing in your fov at a time you have to move your vision plane around to see anything else so when you see someone walk out in front of you feet in front of you you can not do anything about it you wont even have time to swerve or even release the gas pedal this is an imposible scenario for the sdc the sdc will see you or more feet back it will know you are their and it will be tracking you and get this this is the important bit so will every other sdc in range visually of you so the car coming the other way will also see you the two cars will coordinate with each other share data they will both see you it will weight your existence as a probability and what it think you could do and constantly dozens of not hundreds of times a second re see you re measure you and re predict what it thinks you will do and so will the other car when you move the cars will already be acting before your foot gets inches into the road both cars will automatically begin to act if they can brake they will brake if they must swerve the car that was to hit you will swerve to miss you and coordinate with the other car to also swerve so it does not head on the other sdc this will all happen at cpu cycle speeds so insanely fast it will be like the flash or superman casually walking around at superspeed while the slow beings you move around like molasses slow and easy to predict it really can be that good you would have to get pretty damned creative to trick on sdcs will do what drives like me do but on a whole new level of insane eadd extremely aggressive defensive driving part of this driving is being proactive about possible dangers for example doing everything you can to avoid getting into a situation where you do not have outs available at all times directions you can go to avoid some trouble seeing a possible hey what if this guy does this or that situations and proactively changing your circumstances in advance even if he does nothing so that if he does your position to alter or avoid is improved sdcs will be able to do what i do on such an insane level that it will make what i do look like a squirrel trying to fly a starship
479,swerving is not pointless it works quite well if you know how to do it know how to keep control of your car know the limits of your car and yourself and are paying enough attention and this is the important bit and why swerving is usually pointless in advance to be able to react to something you need to react too if you are reacting at the last second no swerving will usually not help you just brake as best you can it is interesting to note that when abs brakes came out rear end collisions when down but head on and other collisions went up before you would slam on the brakes swerve but still go straight because you were sliding abs retained wheel grip control so you were able to swerve and get whacked another way because you had no idea where you were swerving into
480,now that is an excellent summary the only thing i would add and might be the most important is googlewaymo took a realistic approach or might call it good enough or say a level approach they are not trying to do level google is a very good engineering organization and able to do incredible stuff but they did not take an approach that was beyond what is possible to do in a reasonable time there were much more fun approaches that could have been taken more futuristic ones that required far far less manual work i so appreciate this aspect of google it is very easy to let yourself get ahead of yourself and loose perspective of what is actually possible and what is dreaming yes do some dreaming but maybe more reasonable dreaming we use to have these slot cars when i was a kid then there was these cars that did not need slots that were much harder to control google is using a slot car approach with the map being the slot and then taking exceptions of what is expected on a per case basis it is a very manual thing you could say it is much more controlled they are not taking a human approach where you could plop the car down anywhere and it would figure out how to drive all the level stuff from musk is honestly silly talk we do not have the algorithms to do level we are not even close if musk had them in secret those same algorithms would be used for many other things than just self driving and would be used i would also expect they would have been shared as the ai community is a community that shares breakthroughs now i am a big fan of musk overall but here i think he is doing everyone a disservice plus i know much smarter than i and therefore he is also aware of what he is doing it would be different if it was just ignorance
481,googlewaymo solved police officer directions maybe years ago or about then the k car have a date to be delivered by google has been able to do driving without safety drivers for a while now heck in they were pushing for the steering wheel and pedals to be removed googles new self driving car ditches the steering wheel waymo has confirmed just recently the service rolling out this year
482,the proof is having the cars drive without safety drivers that is what it is all about anything else you can fake i remember years ago when google wanted the pedals and steering wheel removed from the cars and that told me they were the real deal from four years ago googles new self driving car ditches the steering wheel new self driving car ditches the steering wheel googlewaymo has now done snow rain fog and ice we do not know how extreme that snow can be for example but they did show their new ai algorithm at google io that can handle snow they have been testing in the snow in michigan alphabet looks to snowy michigan to test self driving cars autos selfdriving waymoalphabet looks to snowy michigan to test self driving cars iduskbncvsn search on google io keynote and near the end they show the ai algorithm that can see in the snow
483,waymo has the ability for someone remote to control the car waymo has already trained with le waymo self driving law enforcement crashes accidents alphabet is training law enforcement on how to handle self driving waymo has to solve before able to use cars without safety drivers there is no one to drive the car in the car
484,thanks i forgot i wanted to watch that part of google io i wonder if when they remove the safety drivers if they also need disable the steering wheels i cant imagine that waymo would risk a year old trying to see if they can make the van hit something
485,i already read that article on le it focused on what happens if the waymo vehicle crashes i just read about the remote control stuff today im impressed but i still would like to see early riders in vans without safety drivers before i am convinced that waymo is light years ahead seems like im not the only one who doesnt believe were as far along as waymo tesla and others say driving ai winter full autonomy waymo tesla uber
486,in the case of rear ending the person behind is always at fault your main responsibility as a driver is whats happening in front of you or your direction of travel you cant control whats happening behind you the best you can manage is getting out of the way of a tailgater asap which isnt always possible if someone has rear ended a google car then i can guarantee you that they werent paying attention or they were driving too closetoo fast to react just the same way i can guarantee you that the guy that rear ended me not long ago was doing just the same my dad has also been rear ended a number of times while at a complete stop either at a traffic light or waiting at a roundabout driving a whopping great hard to miss landrover there was literally nothing he could have done to prevent them unless he could somehow read the mind of the person about to hit him
487,it isnt always the fault of the person behind sometimes you cant control whats going on in front of you either youtubejgmocap_rlw
488,i really want to write a full response but i have to run interesting facts million miles driven million miles autonomous vehicles active milesweek they talk a lot about a baseline but never get specific as to what the baseline crash rate is crashes over million miles is miles per crash thats very close to the miles between crashes for drivers in the us i forget if the latter number is reported crashes or estimated all crashes as google says some of their crashes appear small enough that they ordinarily wouldnt get reported that said googles cars all have trained drivers with clean records who are willing to take over and are paid not to get distracted just with that fact alone they should have a slight advantage over the typical driver which includes teens the elderly drunks etc this does discourage over reliance on google and others self reported crash statistics they had said several times that they were only involved in two crashes theyre also still not giving specifics about which crashes were under human control and which were under computer control they dont have to
489,a good thing this failure to recognize objects never happens with humans it happens all the time everybody acknowledges that sdc need to prove a significantly better driving record than humans before they are accepted after that all these hypothetical who do we choose to die situations are purely stupid because on the whole humans do a shitty job driving and frankly quite often making moral decisions furthermore computers in controlled situations gigaomcommicrosoft says its new computer vision system can outperform humans already recognize objects and persons faster and better than humans mediumcomthe physics arxiv blogthe face recognition algorithm that finally outperforms humans cadbffc again it has to be proven in sdc cars by a safety record
490,it is hard to complain about statistical significance when theres nothing to compare it to we have no idea how many human interventions there have been humans with professional drivers ready to take control at all times would presumably also perform quite well although k miles without accident is not even close to extraordinary when they have driven million miles without accident or any human intervention then maybe they will be ready for preliminary commercial deployment at least as a beta program yes i just made up that number but maybe it is the right order of magnitude what do you think
491,will be interesting to see how much more pressure will be put on sdc manufacturers to report failures after all car companies have been able to hide behind the all too obvious shortcomings of the navigation communication and control systems humans of their products for far too long
492,germanys decisive push to clear autonomous car regulations could give the country an advantage in the race to become the global leader in developing the technology oh that looks promising lets continue reading germany is rewriting its traffic laws to include autonomous cars among the primary rules in its draft legislation is that these cars will still require a steering wheel and that a human must still sit behind it mmm no thats definitely not how you become the leader in self driving technology
493,well ive got no problem with that its a safety precaution and when a technology is as new and untested in the real world as a two tonne machine rolling past the public at up to mph without a human in charge it does a lot for the publics state of mind to require a human behind a steering wheel and presumably a foot hovering over the brake pedal too
494,how about instead of simply requiring steering wheels and humans behind them we start thinking about legislation on how to safely remove them that would be acting like a leader in self driving technology and not just as a follower if we wait until the technology is ready then comes the question how do we know its actually ready what tests do we need what proof is convincing shouldnt we start trying to answer those questions before the technology is ready to avoid any unnecessary delay after all human driving kills people there is no lack of incentive in shortening the deployment of full autonomy
495,if we wait until the technology is ready then comes the question how do we know its actually ready what tests do we need what proof is convincing the tech is ready when the public has trust in it that would be acting like a leader in self driving technology and not just as a follower that would be useless actionism and symbolic politics without any merit requiring a driver and a steering wheel does not hold back the industry during research it does not matter needing a back up and when the tech is ready for mass deployment in the general public then you can drop the requirements
496,initially i can only see some highways bypasses or even just a separated lane on certain roads becoming sdc only to the benefit of safety and efficiency we might also see neighborhoods with specific ordinances or tax breaks encouraging homeowners to own and use sdcs i honestly cant see human driven cars going away completely for a very long time culture will preserve them for as long as they can be maintained or restored also great portions of rural and even urban areas arent marked or well maintained enough to accommodate the theoretical sdcs without controls owners of human driven vehicles will definitely push back against any new laws or government funded infrastructure that does not apply to them you know nimbyisms and such
497,ny state vehicle traffic law control of steering mechanism no person shall operate a motor vehicle without having at least one hand or in the case of a physically handicapped person at least one prosthetic device or aid on the steering mechanism at all times when the motor vehicle is in motion
498,what if that said vehicle didnt have a steering wheel what would be considered as a steering mechanism
499,it seems pretty obvious to me that the self driving controls are a type of aid in contact with the steering mechanism of the time ny drivers just need to be classified as handicapped to fully meet the letter of the law compared to self driving cars we meatbags are quite handicapped so that shouldnt be a problem
500,this is the best tldr i could make original http y self driving cars fix law article reduced by im a bot in what they argue is a case of new york law not keeping up with technology legislators are pushing to change a measure that requires drivers to keep at least one hand on the steering wheel while the vehicle is in motion they argue the law will not only stymie the introduction of automated driving systems that are already in the works but could also ensnare drivers who use parking assist features now offered in some models audi brought one of its prototype vehicles to albany last week but could not put the technology into operation because of the states law extended summary http npredditcomrautotldrcommentsltexclusive_ny_pols_want_to_fix__steering_wheel faq http npredditcomrautotldrcommentsbfmfaq_autotldr_bot version tldrs so far theory http npredditcomrautotldrcommentsbfhttheory_autotldr_concept feedback http npredditcommessagecompose toautotldr pms and comment replies are read by the bot admin constructive feedback is welcome top keywords drive system technology state law
