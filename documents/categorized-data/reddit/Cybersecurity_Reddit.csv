0,freedom inherently comes with risks some safety measures should just be encouraged not enforced i mean it would technically be in the publics best interest to stay home all day and never interact with strangers but a free society is always going to be vulnerable to dangers and the effects of bad decision making
1,id be pretty concerned with two things hacking are the cars talking to each other to achieve this if yes whats stopping mass surveillance of the population
2,the exact same attack can be done on a human driver with nothing but a high powered flashlight at the end of the day you cant make anything perfectly safe against an attacker with unlimited time and funds to develop an attack thats the lesson weve learned from millenia of war offense will always win given enough time and money as silly as it seems if you want to kill someone badly enough you could get a nuke on the black market and simply vaporize their autonomous car
3,i imagine people will probably get away with it at first then itll get sorted wouldnt you know the range from the number of cars affected assuming they all log carry cameras and are networked for traffic control in theory everything is scramblable but you want to avoid being caught wouldnt just hacking the system be less risky than actually being on site with a device btw the subject is self driving cars and the central traffic control system they will eventually use not automatic cruise control eg tesla
4,tesla rolled out a fully automatic prototype i believe heard it on rt podcast but assuming the waves used for this echolocation are easily recreatable a homemade device could just be emitting random signals you probably wouldnt be able to easily lock a car signal so the interference would be intermittent that said on a short enough list of frequencies it can cycle quick enough to block out say of what the car can read that means at a stoplight maybe a quarter of those cars get effected and will be recycling frequency if the blocker keeps cycling the only real limit is keeping the signal on long enough to tell the car they cant use it i assume itll ignore a few milliseconds of interference and the odds of collision are also very slim especially since it is required they have manual controls in most cases the mesh network system that will link all cars location can also probably be jammed not cheaply i assume but might make my whole idea moot for all i know i dont know how they plan to pull that off but if its not a satellite link and just lan you can probably mess with that channel too same device several signals now realistically a cheap build you could still probably get several frequencies covered at once that wont be directionally broadcasted without a wide array of points and geometry and even so if you had it in a car or something the likelihood of being mathematically pinpointed as the source is slim and i doubt a detective would find you prosecutable before manufacturers find a workaround you can download to these fancy whips if a manhole was open and letting out hot air nearby pressure changes could change who could be the culprit hacking would require a connection that the car trusts i believe they built the dlc interface to not really do anything except check teslacom for news and updates its pretty locked down and requires approval from the driver forcing a connection installation and hardware control while driving doesnt seem practical finally i know this isnt perfect not really fleshed out im pretty certain this wont actually happen someone with a six figure salary is in charge of that but it is scary to think that a driverless car will allow someone totally asleep to be driving along unable to react if the machine is compromised
5,oh right i forgot about forward and autopark cams whole idea shot the sleeping hypothetical was more about our dependence and trust in this as soon as its available i think id feel way more secure on a plane with a pilot doesnt matter that i trust a computer more a person has self preservation and the ability to monitor a machine i dont know many machines that id trust to monitor themselves
6,does anyone feel that self driving cars that talk to each other could be a bad thing i know it sounds like an ideal situation to eliminate traffic accidents and all that but i think and this is just me but can the cars be hacked information passing wirelessly between vehicles without human intervention leaves a lot of trust concerns should we start using self driving cars to transport our children to soccer practice it will happen trust me i dont think we are moving in the right direction on this idea
7,such an attack would have to be incredibly widespread to even approach the aggregate destruction humans cause by transporting their children to soccer practice yes there might be the possibility of small scale hacks initially cause some problems but compared to how terrible your typical human is at driving their kids to soccer practice i would say this is a risk worth taking furthermore exploits like this can be patched and repaired and the system made progressively more secure on the other hand there is little to nothing you can do about human soccer practice chauffeurs who are bad drivers other than make sure your suv is bigger than their suv

10,encryption is always an option they already have this kind of stuff for your remote for your car to unlock the door its encrypted in some way im not an expert in that but i do know there have been some security issues with thieves being able to transmit the signal to open your car and it opens no alarms no nothing to answer your question theres nothing stopping people from sending false signals but whether or not the car interprets them as real and reacts to them is a different story imagine a hacker were to be driving down the road and decide to recant the rock falling whats stopping him from saying theres a rock infront of me everyone behind me stop immediately they take that instruction as truth and act accordingly the car systems have to be built with security that isnt really feasible yet you have to protect the communications easy we do this all the time and the communications encryption method you also have to protect the hardware in from way from being tampered with in a way that could send false signals its very complicated and wont be an easy hurdle to overcome
11,yes and no cryptography in general is not designed to be slow though some cryptography is designed to be slow for example when used to protect passwords the idea being that a slow algorithm wont matter to a user who has the password as a short delay is hardly noticeable for an attacker trying thousands of possible combinations on the other hand a slight delay per try will add up radically increasing the amount of time it takes to arrive at the correct password when it comes to algorithms designed for communications though speed is an important factor think about mobile cell phones ok this example is encryption rather than signing but it illustrates the point if each bit of data was encrypted using a slow algorithm parts of the conversation would soon start to get dropped a slow algorithm would be impracticable there are many algorithms out there and choosing the correct one is often a case of weighing up speed versus the security required for the job at hand more secure algorithms are generally speaking slower tldr there are lots of cryptographic algorithms some designed to be fast and some to be slow

13,the people in the cars would have panic attacks also its super risky what is a car skids or something instant wrecks everywhere
14,one malicious hacker away from a mass casualty event
15,hacked car pileup
16,i would have to have no windows because id be having a panic attack at every intersection
17,wow cool what could go wrong and kill a bunch of people cell tower outage power outage lane striping fades road construction someone drives their own car snow flurry falling leaves flat tire person walks or bikes software gets out of date or hacked squirrel chews on a gadget bird poops on a sensor
18,ok but like can hackers or whatever not just be able to cause crashes and such seems a bit to dangerous if you ask me
19,the number of heart attacks would skyrocket
20,cyberwar intensifies
21,yet we have millions of software bugs humans driving every day no good answers with cars besides making the roads accessable to all did everyone notice in that tweet thread that elon admitted to traffic going up immensely when ai takes the wheel this day was coming all auto makers are spending billions to develop this tech and if you had recognized the trend in auto safety systems ai is just the next logical step to vehicle safety my hope is that more people will value being outside of the car and get enough support to make our public roads equitable to all users this will be independent of whatever cars are doing because the safety standards will be looked at outside of the driver seat and at the most vulnerable peds bikes kids playing unfortunately ill be dead before i see meaningful change in this maybe my kids will enjoy it though
22,it works till you get hacked
23,and people would start dying of heart attacks
24,i guarantee sitting in one of those cars could cause a heart attack looks like a terrifying ride
25,id probably have a heart attack if i was in a car at that intersection to many moving death traps to feel comfortable with them all moving so freely
26,self driving could also lead to little heart attacks a day imagine being inside one of these cars sweet jeebus
27,as a general rule in any industry planning you should never assume technological and major infrastructure advances without evidence of those trends already being established to some degree there are no trends yet to suggest rapid expansion and lithium recycling remains very expensive and specialized its conjecture to claim that there would be a massive expansion of lithium recycling and it is also conjecture to claim that battery tech on evs and other electronics will move away from mostly lithium and as i have said now times even if lithium were recycled on all lithium batteries in the future this would only help maintain lithium use as it grows it would not offset lithium purchases from growing demand which is what the article i cited discusses its not including depleting batteries being replaced over time its discussing raw growth of demand from almost a point of zero even at recycling success it is irrelevant to the point that we dont have enough lithium to begin with if battery tech moves to some more available resource thats another matter in itself that is also conjecture projecting with what technology we have now is the most realistic way to plan around commodity usage we can use cobalt as an analog supply challenges fuel efforts recycle ev and smartphone batteries uk consultant creation inn estimates that by of cobalt will be recycled the bulk of that in china managing director hans eric melin suggests that this wont have a huge impact on the supply chain or pricing because of the expected growth in demand for cobalt such is the demand for cobalt he adds that recyclers and battery makers are converging on limited supplies shenzhen based gem chinas largest recycler which provides cobalt to battery makers has been trying to secure a deal to take a third of mining firm glencores output for a three year period because it cant supply enough cobalt from recycling meanwhile one of its customers battery maker catl has taken a majority stake in another recycler guangdong brunp recycling technology
28,let us not forget the other consequence that is getting increasingly relevant as climate continues to well change the sprawl that car dependency enables makes us more vulnerable to natural disasters not only because the larger footprint of a city means a higher chance that someone is gonna live a natural disaster like the california fires but because were paving over lands that couldve limited the damage of said disaster houston is the prime example with harvey
29,people cant keep their phones secured but they want to ride in driverless cars controlled by computers there will be deaths from people hacking into peoples cars while they are drivingpay this much or i crash your car
30,people cant keep their phones secured but they want to ride in driverless cars controlled by computers there will be deaths from people hacking into peoples cars while they are drivingpay this much or i crash your car
31,you might as well relax before a glitch or hack sends you to a fiery death
32,theres a place called brazil where people are killed everyday for their cell phones or fancy hand bags despite how obviously fucked the world is with the ever widening gap between rich and poor you seem to have no idea the lengths desperate people go to just for a few dollars do you think that by the time self driving cars are the norm that were going to be living in some kind of utopia i dont i think the rich will get richer and the poor will become violent and take bigger risks to secure that almighty dollar
33,i imagine that the future holds membership in a service that provides a self driving vehicle on request think of no need for houses to have garages and driveways and streets would be smaller without the need for parking overall infrastructure costs for such things could shrink considerably i imagine that it also includes various hacking attacks take over a bunch of cars to cause traffic jams as distraction mass car crashes as terrorist attacks driving your target to the second location etc

35,also autonomous ev chargers could be contained rooms that the car loads into by itself pull up door opens drive in door closes charge up in your own little secure room door opens pull out drive off
36,this whole thing would get more traction if they would make a concentrated effort to hash out the legal responsibilities involved in these incidents i dont want to share the road with a bunch of assholes who hide behind an army of lawyers strong arming settlements for the hundreds of deaths that will occur maybe also show peer reviewed third party data defending the ass pull numbers the guy who stands to benefit from to the tune of millions of dollars maybe also prove that you have sufficient protections in place for the computer part to secure it from hackers

38,can someone comment on the cybersecurity of these sorts of systems with the recent facebook activity coming to light and home automation getting very big im hoping that data misuse and gathering wont be a problem here in the future but being realistic it probably will happen to some extent im worried that similar abuses could happen with autonomous vehicles
39,until someone finds a way to hack them like in fast furious
40,as an it guy working for the us air force im very concerned about how accessible the computer technology in self driving cars will be one bad update can completely wreck a network i am seriously concerned that self driving cars will present terrorists who can hack with a highly accessible weapon of mass destruction if im ignorant of how these cars are being programmed to prevent intrusion please inform me until i can see proof that im wrong i will continue to believe there is no such thing as safe software
41,i feel like the manufacturers should all come together to create a company with the top minds from all groups which would be responsible for automation i think if one company created the base automation for all it would be safer than all automakers hacking and slashing their way to a good enough product it also would stop the inevitable manufacturing monopolies if any company could start up and create a new type of vehicle and just apply existing tested automation to it
42,state sponsored hacking would turn every self driving car into a slow moving low yield cruise missile baby steps until we get our infrastructure secure
43,state sponsored hacking would turn every self driving car into a slow moving low yield cruise missile baby steps until we get our infrastructure secure
44,im hesitant about driverless cars mostly because i worry about the day some future terrorist or corrupt government decides to hack into the system and kill everyone on the road
45,what i wanna know is how can self driving cars manufacturers prevent hackers from tracelessly killing people
46,maybe its just me but couldnt they be hacked as can all computers and i totally agree its easier to blame a human rather than accepting that computer systems have flaws
47,unless car companies start taking security much more seriously theres no way im getting in an autonomous vehicle with no way to override cars with automatic brakes etc have already been successfully hacked before
48,high end you think that will apply reliably to cheap daily drivers really you think that shit wont get hacked and shut down the entire in socal just to entertain some asshole and his friends you think people wont tinker their shit like idiots to make it drive faster and cause accidents as a result you think that when glitches do happen and they sure as hell will theyll only affect one car what happens when someone fucks up the programming on the ford focus and they roll out prone to total failure under some one in a millionthus rather common but not always easy to find ahead of time circumstance what happens when they fuck up some hardware as happens pretty much every year to at least one major manufacturer and the programming doesnt know how to deal with the trouble that the hardware problem causes like an uneven front brake performance under extreme cold while going downhill causing sudden swerve to one side hell what happens when we realize that always put driver safety first or never swerve ends up not actually being a good rule and people die because of stupid programming decisions besides which this tech will not become as common as quickly as elon musk and others think until it can cycle into the secondary market in very large numbers for over a decade while still being safely usable it wont replace the year old hondas and toyotas and old ford pickups on the road so it will be all automated vehicles so road conditions will be less chaotic is blatant nonsense maybe in years maybe if wealth inequality lessens as well in that time
49,vulnerable people are supposed to have carers if the crosser had more sense and the driver did their job this would not have happened technological advancement is already moving at a snails pace without stopping all testing because of two blatant individual failings i hope her family sues the shit out of the negligent blob
50,my background is in developing algorithms for data analysis banking and investments but my programming skills amount to a well trained script kiddie at best so im finding it quite difficult simply from a programming perspective i understand the concepts at a much higher level than my educators but stumble hard on implementation i think most programs ive looked into teach the concepts well but infosec is a lot more commoditized than machine learning so if you dont plan to rise to the top youll have more demand and opportunity in infosec with a basic level of understanding everyone needs a secure database but few people need a simple neural network would you happen to have any recommendations for learning to program more as a subconscious reflex im very goal oriented so doing more exercises for the sake of exercises kills me inside python
51,i will never rely on a computer to control a vehicle moving at mph its a computer it can be hacked its been proven already too many people rely on computers if the world died no power or internet it would take less than hrs for half the world to die off and leave the smart ones to thrive
52,yeah ive seen tesla owners say you cant do this because you have to squeeze the wheel every seconds are people able to sleep because they put a clamp on the wheel or do they hack the software
53,imagine ordering a pizza only to see the delivery guy pulling into your driveway dead from a heart attack
54,i yearn for the day when we read the headline like driver of self driving car died from heart attack mid drive and arrives home for the holidays dead
55,yeah it kills me and ill be the first to admit i enjoy how modern cars allow me to relax behind the wheel when cruising down a highway thanks to features but the idea that i would ever close my eyes and try to hack my car with other people with lives around me is so ridiculously perverse the very fact this gets filmed so much shows how distracting it is to others let alone the danger of hacking ones own car
56,yeah the steering presence is required for a reason hacking it to make it seem like your hands are on the wheel is stupid and will only make tesla look bad thankfully though even if his rig fell off the car would pull off and slow to a stop with hazard lights on
57,oh woah big revelation their bud did my initial post not make it abundantly clear i was pissed off at tesla zealotry being displayed by promoting dangerous stunt driving are you going to deny the veracity of my post and endorse this sleep on public roads bs or just attack me for speaking with a shred of reason youre obviously very upset that someone is speaking against something you apparently care a lot about tesla cars are pretty neat this hypebeast stunt stuff is trash and youre apparently fully okay with the behavior preferring to attack a random redditor me pka bitchboy now i guess for pointing out that a mod shouldnt use such a reckless video to push for a product they obviously are really into
58,no and i hate to just go straight flamewar on someone but shut up and stop condoning people hacking their cars to sleep on public highways saying ridiculous things like robots can drive better than people is a childlike fantasy tale and no current tech or law should have anyone anyone tesla or not running around doing hack overrides of their cars safety features so that they can sleep while they drive this is so infuriatingly irresponsible and only undertaken by the biggest selfish turds who are trying to use a shared dangerous space to create viral youtube content to go viral on reddit there are hours of the day that you can sleep that dont involve going to bed for a useless minute nap while stunt driving on the sole road tens of thousands of people are using to get on with their lives who are not distracted and have to deal with someone next to them who is literally asleep just like we dont let jeff gordon guzzle jack daniels while going mph even though he won a bunch of nascar races the tech will be cool thats it right now its not and thinking anyone anywhere has the right to pull these behaviors is gross selfishness
59,im putting the blame on the driver and everyone who endorses the behavior and reshares stunt driving especially a flagrantly pro tesla mod who thinks promoting these videos is cool do you not see the cult like tesla owners and other non owners who are delusional tech zealots calling this perfectly safe the person equating them to rosa parks for their breaking of the law obviously youre a big rah rah tesla dude and im obviously ranting against them here but this has zero to do with whether a tesla is a cool car whether assisted driving makes life easier etc it has to do with someone so disgustingly and willfully pranking trolling promoting or whatever web term you want to use to describe an asshole on a highway pulling a stunt and watching a bunch of people promote the behavior online there are other ways to use assisted driving features that dont involve trying to become viral on the internet through safety feature hacking and doing eyes closed driving youd obviously feel different if it was a different brand jesus christ youre pathetic stop trying to gaslight me with this bullshit and deflecting youre agreeing its idiotic but then saying my opinion is wrong andor would differ if it was a different brand well which is it genius am i right or wrong youre proving my point fantastically by going after me and not the driver or person sharing this unsafe crap if i saw someone promoting this same behavior in a ferrari or a geo id say the same damn thing but im not and you can either choose to join the rank of people who think this is cool or join those of us in reality who dont think some rich jerk should make a commuter road their playground to flex and create viral shock content
60,what about hacking or something like that if a hacker decides to kill a ton of people and gets into the cars they can if they want also the government can easily use this for their own corrupt purposes
61,someones already had a tesla drive them most of the way to the hospital while they were busy having a heart attack cars can already tell if youre drowsy or falling asleep im sure by the time they can drive themselves properly theyll be able to tell if youre incapacitated and drive you to help
62,im putting the blame on the driver and everyone who endorses the behavior and reshares stunt driving agreed although i am guilty of taking pleasure in the subreddit ridiotsincars and rconvenientcop to be fair id like to see less post on it for the sake of humanity obviously youre a big rah rah tesla dude im more of an anti fossil fuel dude since ive had enough with harley davidson bikers spouting loud pipes save lives and the germans automakers whom are literal convicted frauds for designing the absolute best emission cheating hardware and software i know its a hyperbole hatred but its the internet so i can vent i guess beside it just happens that the best ev is also spearheading on av there are other ways to use assisted driving features that dont involve trying to become viral on the internet through safety feature hacking and doing eyes closed driving you and i can blame teslas marketing and misused of the term autopilot when it comes to the ordinaryaverage joe as their interpretation can be optimistic as you have said it yourself youre agreeing its idiotic but then saying my opinion is wrong andor would differ if it was a different brand well which is it genius am i right or wrong youre proving my point fantastically by going after me and not the driver or person sharing this unsafe crap just going off what other redditors have pointed out regarding your posts history beside we can agree to disagree but as i see it the person sharing this post or the pro tesla mod had no wrong doing you can either choose to join the rank of people who think this is cool or join those of us in reality who dont think some rich jerk should make a commuter road their playground to flex and create viral shock content im a pessimist i dont think avs should be benchmarked against human drivers but human drivers especially na ones should be held up to a higher standards a riced up honda civic weaving in and out of tight spots in heavy traffic could be more research is needed probs more dangerous than a tesla on autopilot besides senior citizens might benefit from autonomy the most as it enables their freedom for longer while posing as lesser hazard on the road
63,worked in insurance for years made it to lower senior management in two global corporations and have a diploma in insurance really im a totally interesting and swell guy who absolutely didnt own several different shades of grey suit honest im going to say on this one that i disagree an insurance company is in the business of lowering risk exposure against premium charged in order to increase their profit margin essentially the less they have to pay out the better sometimes they do this with good advice to the customer based on their knowledge of what likely causes of loss are particularly type of door lock or burglar alarm works better they will advise you fit it and can lower your premium accordingly they know with those youre less likely to have a loss and they get to keep more premium across the pool of risks they insure every year anyway currently to insure a car they have to assess individual drivers ability lifestyle carelessness decision making skills location commute type of parking level of car usage type of use and experience some they can ask you some they can use big data to figure the trends but in a lot of cases they simply cant know as much about you as you know about you so their premium charged has to guess and factor that in i worked on multiple books of motor insurance that had a combined operating ratio money in verses money out of over you need less than to be making money and these were the big insurance companies with the really good systems low operating costs internal efficiencies and damn good actuaries in the uk the motor industry lost money every year for over a decade i dont know the stats these daystheyd make up for it in other areas for an insurance company where in the uk it is compulsory for a driver to have at least third party liability to cover you damaging other things or people theres simply a lot of stuff that you the driver could do that they cant account for in their numbers but will have to pay for if you screwed up but an automatic car not owned by an individual but by company trying to run a profit themselves with known software and hardware combinations known and predictable use cases secure storage facilities regular maintenance and user feedback reporting and a large data set provided by the company themselves that reports all incidents and not just the ones that the drivers do actually report thats going to lead to a much more predictable loss data set and you have a company to sue when it goes wrong suing a regular person for the money they dont have can be a hiding to nothing so the way i see it insurance companies cant wait to get their hands on the business model of automated drive and fleet pool car operations where the unknown human element is a much more manageable in the insurance press its been a topic of discussion for years with some people actually thinking the biggest resistance wont come from the insurance companies but from the population resisting having their freedom to drive taken away from them and from governments that will be slow to unpack the current insurance legislation and open it up to allow innovation in the market the insurance companies want more money for their shareholders they often do it by slicing the back end operation which i in operations hated them for it made people their own staff have worse quality lives all so the shareholders could benefit paying less in claims is a much much more lucrative option and may even stop them for a while from carving into themselves for the extra cash i think they want the automation they wont resist it its way too much good money
64,so yeah me spending part of my day yesterday in this sub having a thoughtful conversation about deep sea autonomous boats for data collection was part of an act and im just here to stalk a mod who posts k upvote stories everyday there is no benefit to anyone to share this dudes stupidity and it is both the driver and the ops goal to get people watching the stunt which should be ignored and shunned for its danger and me saying something about it and getting a modicum of support has pissed you the hell off because apparently you really like the video too i wouldnt know truthfully because all youve done it attack me but ill infer until i hear otherwise for the dozenth time this story is trash and sharing it at all is encouraging stunt drivers to get more attention for life risking behavior the tech is cool and has potential show it off on private property imagine a bulletproof glass company decided to stand at the edge of their property and fire at their glass toward a public street filled with cars would you be cool with sharing that video i mean the tech had been proven right
65,im a relatively new driver i once made the mistake of pulling back over without checking my blind spot and very nearly hit another car its the kind of stupid mistake ill never make again specially after the heart attack i nearly had for it i think of myself as a very careful driver but damn if i havent made some shameful mistakes while i was learning it amazes me though the number of drivers who repeatedly make this kind of mistake purely due to not giving a crap the same drivers who feel indicating is an inconvenience and drive feet from your tailgate
66,then theres west virginia where you have more lanes than youll need in your entire life but a beater pickup pulling a trailer overloaded with unsecured scrap metal pulling a smaller flat trailer with a rusted out washing machine wobbling for dear life is somehow managing to use all of them
67,lol i have hundreds of random comments across tons of various reddit subs and yet youre still cant help yourself but the scream at me like i killed your dog and accuse me of saying things i never have and existing here solely to attack the op wheres your head at man oh yeah rabidly seething at me and confirming my thesis crazy zealots will do crazy crazy things to defend something they love go drive your autopilot around andor take a nap just not at the same time
68,not a bad problem to have i mean literally thats what donnation means i dont need it anymore compare that to the situation of charities that report because so many people scam online there are less and less people willing to donate online the general idea was we have unneccesary deaths people die one from a gunshot wound to the head the other one from a missing liver translant lets cut that short by taking the otherwise still useable gunshot victims liver and sowing it into the other patients body we can save one of them guaranteed the idea was never we have a right to those organ numbers we have a right to now demand those organs the idea was never we now get to complain because large numbers of organs are not there where we need them the general idea is innovate your way out of this for example allow some donors to decide for themself how their organs will be used for example i myself would have no problems with my organs being donnated to a poor schlob who never won anything to specify that if my reccipient has plans like climb mount everrest ride the bike or have an active and healthy social life go tell him to fck himself and prioritise the bottom of the list these people whom you wouldnt trust with a fresh vegan liver give them my liver put a smile on their faces shit on the guy who plans to run with the bulls or who has an instagramm account donnate your heart to the bottom of the transplant waiting list your liver to an recovering alcoholic your skin to someone who looks like a two and otherwise would need skingrafts from their own ass and your dick to someone who put chronic masturbation under hobbies let my shit go to people who actually appreciate it not take it for granted i could see a lot of people out of their free will donnating their organs and actually feeling good about it skin blood liver shit i take it like with the computer if anything can be reused before you toss it into the biohazard bin and burry it in an abandoned mineshaft be my gust grab what you need to when it is clear that i dont need it anymore just dont give it to the prick with the hope and stars in their eyes give it to themiserable bastard that has never won anything and make them for once feel like they own the world the downside would be that you would actually have to respect those wishes and such you know i will not be around to check anymore but i am sure it would be a hoot to tell mister schmidt from b that the medical board has a heart for him even though the medical board cant legally give that heart to anyone else but too often when a board decides who gets the organs and who gets a second chance i wanna wipe the smug grins off of their faces and go yea she ugly as fuck but shes a two so the rmeistermalkav clause grips and she gets his skin yes all of it see what she needs cut off the rest make a trendy bag out of it and this is where i see the problem the doctors would never agree to actually respect the donors wishes and hand over their power they would allways push for this little bit of extra of finger waving of such and of course there would be the the people that go i want my body parts to go to someone who is white i know it is harsh but better then publically whining about how fewer transplants we will have because more and more people will surive would be to take the good with the bad just increase the numbers every racist bastard who gets his wish means one fewer place on that list needing to be filled an other option would be medically assisted suicide i am dead serious on that one if all you care is get places of of that list go fuck your ethics board untill they bleed from both ends and offer assisted suicide have a suicide coaster in the back that kills you in a painless safe and guaranteed way in exchange for the right to harvest the organs of course respect these peoples wishes what they want to be done with the organs and the grafts but in the end if you are good enough to whine publically about the list let me remind you that if you pushed for harvesting rights to suicide victims bodies your numbers would look quite different yes there would be the option about not doing harm but that could be done with a patient activated mechanism or and this would be my preferred option actually look into technology look into artificial hearts look into stem cell research and make sure all your people on that waiting list understand that if they vote the people against stem cell research out of office they may actually do the world a bigger favor then by leaving them in and just signing up to be donors just you know become single issue voters for an election my best case only hand the advertising contracts to inform about organ donnations to people who are donors make fun fact sheets allow me to specify my wsh that nobody who is an sjw should get anything from me but if there is any miserable sick son of a bitch that is just a grouch give him my body and tell him to toast me once in a while staple it in and see how it goes use what you can from my body and go fuck your ethics board if you can get it out of my body without retching uncontrollably you are entitled to have it if any of my body ends up in an art project go buy a big pack of smokes for the nearest smoker and tell him my story but i would rather rot completely intact underground and make sure maggots and shit get my body then go to the afterlife with the secure knowledge that my bodyparts are taken for granted and to be distributed as seen fit by a team of medical experts
69,just hack them and have them kill the people inside or something
70,thats great news thats a lot of people continuing to live whereas the alternative is a lot of people dying so that some people might or might not live a little longer thankfully there has been a lot of research into artificial and lab grown organs the tech might track closely with the introduction of self driving cars or only leave a few years with a shortage also there is a lot of other medical tech that should help with the reduction of the need for organs so it looks like we are preparing i mean unless we start preparing now what the heck do they think were doing we already have a shortage with very long waiting lists we seem to be attacking this problem with all guns ablazing already and if were not then thats already the problem
71,i did not even think about how self driving cars will cause an organ shortage unless someone hacks them and then kills us
72,ive been working on a report of sorts on organ donationtransplantation and was in attendance at the white houses summit on this topic a few months ago generally speaking here is the current plan of attack to solve the crisis short term get more people to register as donors and get organ procurement organizations to accept new forms of registration such as social declarations on twitter facebook etc a lot of viable organs that dont get transplanted stem from next of kin not knowing the deceased persons wishes improve current practices to make donor organs last longer in between harvest and transplant and clean up organs that are considered borderline viable these practices are starting to be seen around the country but have a ways to go d printing the future solutions to completely eradicate the problem are here in their infancy still a long ways off so we need steps and to hold us over the dod is actually pouring a decent chunk of money into this technology if you can save a soldier in war with it you can eventually save civvies back at home
73,i am on the transplant waiting list for a kidney for the second time in my life and very likely not my last my kidney failure was caused by a rare genetic disease where my own immune system attacked my kidneys beginning around the age of it is called dense deposit disease i would prefer than any life that can be saved would be however it can be saved i dont like the idea of this being referred to as an unintended consequence the intention is always to save as many lives as possible there are lots of different potential treatments on the horizon for esrd im personally looking forward to when we can produce an organ for a patient that cannot be rejected thereby eliminating the need for immunosuppressive medication these medications often create a whole host of other issues such as an extensive list of side effectsresulting in using medication to treat the side effects and increased chance of catching other diseases and illnesses during the time with my first transplant that didnt last long due to some of the aforementioned complications i got bk virus normal immune systems are exposed to this but know how to handle it shingles norovirus twice within a month and several other issues too plentiful to list now all in the short two years i had it to me the real solution is not more organ donors but instead more reliable treatments that provide a long term solution that does not require multiple transplants over the course of ones life i know people who are working on transplant number three or four
74,never fear people will screw this up too self driving cars can be hacked with just and a laser pointer http self driving cars can hacked just
75,in fact i can imagine hackers doing it and making it look like an accident
76,you have been hacked rerouting to secluded spot in the woods important upon your arrival remove your clothes to avoideh im going to kill you anyway
77,youre right im sure there would be many more people willing to donate if that helped them secure their childrens future for example
78,i think the biggest problem with autonomous cars are going to be hackers you really think auto mobile industry is going to provide top notch security i doubt it heck even multi billion dollar corporations like google cant keep them out another issue is accountability is it the driver or the car at fault when an accident occurs how would insurance work
79,look im a believer in the tech eventually but the whole even our most underdeveloped models will be an improvement is speculative bullshit ive been driving since without a ticket or accident much of that through mn winters disclosure i did slip into someones bumper in a parking lot during an ice storm but was going very slow and no damage was done i have over years in my model and that clobbers the years in automated driving for sure computers will end up being better and wont be distracted or get tired still we have a long way to go to prove that the tech is consistently better than humans one needs to consider we also have a long history of hubris and over confidence in technology visa crashes all across europe this weekend leaving millions without a way to pay we found out last year that pretty much every single chip is vulnerable to attack im not against it and i get that we need to prepare people for failures but lets not over promise

81,why does everyone just assume things are secure and wont ever be used maliciously we cant even keep hotel door locks from being hacked or a a simple database with peoples information secure but we want a complicated software system in charge of a vehicle this is a vicious cycle every time something new comes out medical tech wifi whatever corporations fail to think about security first they designed wireless insulin pumps and pacemakers with few if any security protocols in place lets put million cars on the road with that same philosophy good idea

83,you think it be possible to hack the autonomous driving system and herd a fleet of cars to a different destination
84,the problem nobody talks about is when the system gets hacked and it will and hundreds of people die
85,apparently posts here need to be lengthy or be deleted so here goes self driving cars will kill people and we need to accept that that doesnt sound very reassuring it sounds like london lord mayor sadiq khans reassurances to the uk population in the face of all the acid attacks police sanctioned child raping gangs bombings and stabbings that he feels we must get used to the muslim threat because the threat of terror attacks are part and parcel of living in a big city will most likely be an improvement over a human drivers ability most likely that doesnt sound very reassuring anyway which human driver are they talking about
86,this is fucking insane the only reason this is being said is because people are attacking musk and finally calling him out on his bullshit
87,id rather kill myself than be killed by some machine fuck also scary considering cia can hack vehicles and would be able to use this to get rid of whoever they want
88,side benefit gives us empathy for innocent folk at risk of becoming drone attack collateral damage statistics
89,the point is whos accountable and can they be hacked to murder someone
90,yeah were like years away from seeing the full benefit of driverless cars itll be ten years before they really become somewhat common and another just to get them saturated into the market and have people who grew up driving their own cars age out of the system side point it probably wont be common but hack attacks on cars might become a problem most likely with stealing cars cops will probably have the ability to force your car to pull over which is great if all cops are just and make the best decisions and you dont mind having no autonomy in your own vehicle also any serious analysis of self driving cars will beg the question why public transportation isnt more efficient and readily available in the cities making hundreds of millions of cars network and drive intelligently is probably a bigger pain in the ass than just having good public mass transit systems

92,i dont even like cruise control and where are the ctrlaltdel buttons and if you dont think some russian hackers wouldnt fuck with this i got a bridge in brooklyn to sell you
93,the real issue is taking that portion of the economy which can be as high as and ripping it out of the hands of the in a time when social safety nets are under attack that will definitely kill a lot more people than driving ever did
94,i envision a new set of warfare one that includes hacking the cars of the nation you wish to fight to suicide themselves during rush hourm semi driving themselves into key infostructure all done with the driver helpless to act
95,were gonna be a real life video game for year old hacker kiddies in ukraine or weaponized hackers in russia or china or wherever
96,inter car communication is a terrible idea you think we have a problem with hacking now open an local network api to the people around you no thanks
97,could become more efficientcould also become easier to hack and take over since all the vehicles are connected on a network since the technology doesnt exist these comments are purely speculation
98,you can also cut brake lines and throw out nails and lie about the directions because those cunts didnt buy a squirrel there will always be bad actors but hacking self driving cars raises that barrier of entry pretty high above other simpler ways of fucking someone up
99,that is intimately related to security because without figuring out the security aspects and making them extremely robust youre not going to be able to do things like that any communication into a self driving car that affects its operation is a potential security issue with potentially life threatening consequences and all of those nice emergency features require communications to the car of some form if these communications can be spoofed or manipulated the consequences can be serious and these communications will be a prime target for attack
100,if the car has this capabilities its not if it can be hacked its what resources are required to hack it and how many people have access to them no security is unbreakable
101,what are they going to get their feelings hurt i dont say it to their face who cares ive been doing of the work to keep this shithole secure sooo fuck them virtually as for the flippant comment she is a eco nut and anyone who is around her for five minutes would know she would appreciate that kind of comment sooo whatever
102,how long will it take brain dead morons to start attacking them
103,im interested in how were going change as we have to focus less and less on the road once you dont have to look at the road it opens up some new possibilities maybe the car interiors will be converted to a mini entertainment center where your windshield is now a tv screen or maybe instead of having the car seats face forward they could face inwards towards the center where there could be a table and everyone could play board games i dont knowjust imagining i also envision the roads changing a lot instead of having human readable road signs plastered everywhere they will probably start being machine readable in the future instead of a big red stop sign it might have a qr code that tell the car to stop but that would be too easy to destroy by vandals so theyll have to make it some rfid build in the road all this will be cool until some hackers figure out how to fuck everything up
104,all of the naysayers in this thread fail to see one thing autonomous vehicles will drastically reduce injury and death due to collisions k deaths and m injuries per year from car accidents in the us humans suck at driving the faster we take away all control from humans the more lives will be saved yes there will still be accidents yes the autonomous tech will fuck up and cause accidents yes cars will get hacked and fly off the road but with all of this considered tens of thousands of peoples lives will be saved every year
105,terrorists and government will love these self driving vehicles hack the software and you have a lethal remote controlled weapon
106,see now this is probably where id draw the line what if somebody hacks your car and drives you into a wall sadly no steering wheel there for you to save yourself
107,why is that better than a normal one if it is why not just allow that for all cars cyber truck had a cool looking but likely not legal steering wheel i think the idea is consistency between vehicles so people dont have a learning curve to driving between cars
108,all the proof you need comes from just examining how brittle deep learning systems are train a deep learning system to detect some animal in an image and then ask it to try and detect some non animal wont be able to do it because the system isnt actually learning in a meaningful way its doing complex high dimensional curve fitting but it isnt developing a model of the world to make generalizations from pretty much every ml system in existence boils down to this and that isnt going to cut it for human level general ai perfect real world example of this is adversarial image attacks look it up if youre interested but the basic idea is given an image of a cat feed it to a nn and ask it to guess what it is then take the same image but change only a couple pixels and feed it in again and almost always the system will guess something completely incorrect even though the image looks exactly the same to you and me
109,i know what adversarial image attacks are such things exist for human brains too all kinds of optical visual tricks can fool your brain that doesnt mean your brain isnt capable of doing useful things most of the time same with the ai as long as it drives better than humans on average its good in my book and were quickly approaching that threshold
110,what if the cameras are dirty thats not the same as an image attack i dont think you understand how the attack works after this comment its not just random noise added what if there is ground level fog or a blizzard what about it ai will still react faster to unexpected things also if you put infrared cameras on the car it can see through fog when a human cant no ml system in existence is able to anticipate the future like a human that is false even for the current state of self driving systems teslas fsd models every car and human it sees project their most likely trajectories seconds into the future and chooses the most optimal route add an inhuman reaction time to that heres the more detailed overview of how it works if youre interested youtubejzfwecym t like a human it doesnt have to think like a human it just needs to be better at driving on average and its inevitable
111,a dirty camera means theres no input image that didnt have anything to do with adversarial attacks lol same with fog and blizzard adversarial image attacks are literally just the original image with noise added in feel free to review the research to refresh your memory an ml system ultimately needs to be able to think like a human because were not going to be able to train every situation and the public isnt going to want to get into a car they have no control over if they think its going to kill them when weather conditions arent as favorable as the weather the car was trained in it seems rather ethically dubious to widely release a technology with such glaring issues inherent to the very system the tech is built on
112,yes and a collision between a car an a human on a more vulnerable mode of transportation bike scooter can cause some pretty catastrophic damage without causing death
113,they are very insecure from a security perspective but i think they have bigger fish to fry let car companies worry about vehicle security as they get pwned and embarrassed publicly we already have a system for improving security its called humiliation
114,who cares even if they developed it ass backwards the death rate would be magnitudes lower these comments are from hacks
115,i hate to say this but ive been saying the system is vulnerable for years not just to this kind of interuption but many many other complications as well and besides its not like it worked very well to begin with this video was taken last year after they released the newest version that musk claimed was full self driving vilhtricwy vilhtricwy also for anyone about to throw statistics in my face consider that these articles found major tampering with statistical data to show a favorable outcome of the technology basically tesla has been hiding crash data and has made several procedural rules to avoid counting a majority of crashes as faults of the self driving system these include not having hands on wheels at all times not sucessfuly avoiding an accident even if you are in self driving mode as well as many other excuses to not count a crash on the data set tesla has been lobbying to make this technology mandated so they can corner the market for years and have been intentionally hiding crash data to make it seem safer than it really is to prove that it should be mandated if you really look you can see countless articles all saying something like this but tesla pr department is good at its job they even pay youtubers to show favorable videos tesla uses youtubers test self driving tech public streets trained safety drivershtml fi hy tesla nhtsa storyhtml fi hy tesla nhtsa storyhtml safety regulators put tesla autopilot safety regulators put tesla autopilot its really simple make this technology an option but never a mandate any vehicle must have full capacity to be manually be driven including mirrors and everything like that its the best of both worlds the people who want it have it and the people who dont arent forced to use it
116,we have a chance its vulnerable if we can get to its elon core and destroy it society may be able to drop its obsession with lying hipster billionaires and fight its way back out of the pit of end stage capitalism
117,would you rather be on the road with a properly licensed regulated responsible driver who is not just half assed tested once in his entire life back in the teen years and in a society where we dont pressure people into driving when tired and give people ample cheap public transportation and remove unfair stigmas against it so they can use alternate transportation when needed or let technology we dont even trust to run our dumb little phones correctly do something as important and mission critical as drive a car something that not only can potentially endanger the passenger but people in other cars and property around them regulation and change has to happen technology isnt the solution to everything since technology isnt perfect and can potentially be far more dangerous than a distracted driver our over reliance on technology has gotten us into a world full of anti privacy and anti freedom as well as so many other things that has dehumanized us to a point where we are essentially a slave to it technology has to be a tool not a means to an end we cannot allow automated driving to exist as it would cause so many more issues than it would solve as well as further erode privacy and freedom yes humans driving are problematic but solving that issue by doing common sense things to help our society eliminate a large number of these problems is a far better solution than further enslaving ourselves to repressive big brother technology im a lifelong sysadmin and programmer ask anyone like me and theyll say the same dont let technology run our lives its not anti technology its anti control and technology isnt reliable or secure enough in any situation to allow it bugs and hacks will happen and theres no way to safeguard it

119,i believe a dutch company was able to hack not sure if this is the right term and see all the data a tesla sends now if i remember correctly it wasnt something they could do over and over again tesla could fix the hack in one update but it did show us everything the tesla reports so now courts know what to ask for so at least there is something
120,also prime example of ad hominem attacks signaling loss of argument
121,the only truly important regulation would be car makers are liable for all accidents caused by the self driving car that alone should guarantee that they will spend billions of dollars in research ensuring that the car is both safe for autonomous driving as well as secure against remote hacks any other fixed regulation will just get them to comply with the minimum legal requirements and there isnt any guarantee that those regulations are perfect or even optimal for self driving car safety in fact the government has even hinted that it doesnt want to impose too many regulations on the car makers because its still an infant domain it makes sense but as i said if they were reliable that would be all the incentive they needed to ensure maximum safety and security

123,id be more worried about hackers
124,cops will be irrelevant car just drives you straight to jail instead you spend the whole time freaking out what was it this time defaulted on your mortgage and the bank is taking your kidneys or maybe you missed a traffic ticket and they decided to remove you from circulation its not your fault you cant afford software update and your permarental took a suboptemized traffic route and caused a few milliseconds delay to someone elses commute every second that passes you feel a scream rising in your throat you press the door button but it refuses to respond the bulletproof windows of the tesla permarental designed to protect you from gang violence keeping you from throwing yourself into the road you desperately wish you had bought the standard package so you would have an actual key and not a remote start button just so you could slit your own throat with it the world passes by completely unaware of your growing terror the walls of the car begin to close in as your future as a test subject for a pharmaceutical as a more ethical replacement to animals becomes clear to you its ironic really you protested animal testing in college you see the jail now the drive in beckons as your car makes the final adjustment and prepares to leave you to your fate your phone vibrates the uber bailbondtm app is offering to bail you for ten thousand plus adjusted course mileage surcharge you agree but you only have three hundred bucks left after your apple ieye needed to be replaced last month due to manufacturers fault you open up the dao loan exchange and apply opting for twenty thousand to cover conversions and tumbling to ensure you dont end up with tainted currency the smart contract sits uncompleted as your journey comes to its end your life flashes before your eyes as the money is approved and your account emptied to secure your freedom minus twenty dollar first time credit of course by the time your mostly uneventful life has been played to you the car is almost at its original destination you get out of the car and make your way inside the featureless dormitory you reside in its three foot efficiency elevator depositing you at your tiny quarters you strip off your clothes as the door slides shut behind you the chill of the room biting at you as you do youd have a shower but its been broken for months a slow dripping that fills your meager dwelling with mold and rot the arbitration clause and abdication of rights agreement leaving you without recourse with the corporation that runs the facility you climb into bed the sewn rags you call a blanket wet with moisture that only serves to further your discomfort your ieye playing videos of the latest apple appliances and updating you on the latest celebrity news sleep is fleeting and dreams are corrupted by commercials all that is certain to you is that you will awake into the world and hope your job hasnt been replaced by a machine ok im done
125,imho that is completely different by giving you my passwords you have access to sensitive information using this information you can steal my identity and cost me not only my reputation but also a lot of money and even my freedom if you frame me for something which causes me to get arrested in contrast by giving you my location you know that i like baskin robbins which ill admit can also be costly for my reputation re the netflix and amazon bits i dont understand the netflix one i couldnt care less if you see that as for amazon that is only an issue if it contains items that are medical in nature because as an unauthorized third party with access to that information you could put me in a bad position with potential employers because you dont have to follow hipaa thats just how i view it anyway
126,stuff like this and the rise of cars being used in terrorist attacks makes me genuinely worried about the future is you being allowed to drive your antique car really worth hundreds of thousands of lives think of the children
127,we evolved to be able to do that uhm no we didnt evolve to be able to drive cars have only existed since the late thearly th century we evolved capacities that benefited our survival that allowed us to learn to drive in a rather shit manner but still drive but we didnt evolve to do so self driving vehicles after a fashion kinda evolve to do so though they learn adapt and their hardware is improved to make them better drivers humans are limited to the hardware weve got as inefficient and vulnerable to debilitating stimuli like alcohol or being tired as it is thats not even taking into account how a humans ability to drive does decay after a period of time my grandma cant drive as good as she did years ago a self driving car with proper maintenance would actually improve over time learning from its mistakes in ways the humans cannot with our fallible memories
128,i honestly love this idea ive been imagining this sort of thing for a while now but i assume therell be something that comes along and ruins it for a start if theyre all synchronised with some kind of centralised server someone is going to try and hack that server but even in that rare case i imagine theyd still result in fewer accidents and deaths than we see on our roads currently
129,i have a good true story to describe this i was driving home from egg harbor almost mile drive home from work brother wanted me to drop him off so the expressway made more sense than since i would have to backtrack once in pa to get to his place while if i took the express way he was on the way and would get home faster hell as long as he is paying the toll fine by me we are chugging down the expressway i am doing in the right lane mph psl this road has huge arching onramps so i see a car ahead on the onramp i slow down a little and then more when i check my six brother asks why i am slowing down i take the opportunity to explain my eadd driving to him i say see that onramp car he is going to be an intercept we will arrive at merge at the same time see the car passing me now he would have intercepted as well if i did slam on the brakes swerve hard left behind the passing driver still max braking take the shoulder and prepare still max braking to dive into the grass median if i need to brother bounces off the door window and slams into his loose restraints and goes wtf i just point forward now here is what happened when the onramp car arrived at the straight away wham deer standing in the lane he aggressively swerves left into the right lane to avoid the deer barely missing the passing guy who just passed us precisely where my little geo metro would have been had i not preemptively predicted not that this would happen but that if something did happen that spot is where i did not want to be it would have been a geo sandwich between those two much larger heavier cars it would not have been a good night if we even would have survived it i would have had zero outs i would not be able to go right as that would be into the merging car i would not have been able to go left as that would be into the passing car its a hp cylinder geo metro in th gear go faster is non existant in any useful time frame and braking would not have been sufficient in that timescale outs the only way to secure outs was toe change the odds slow down now so i am not between the cars at the single most dangerous point the merge point so i planned in advance by slowing to let them arrive ahead of me by checking at all to even notice the guy on my six passing me to check ahead that the shoulder and median are clear in case i need to use them do it long enough and this all just happens instinctively in your subconscious you just do it without thinking so much about it when you do it long enough and sdc with its perfect memory scanning and raw speed and higher resolution sensors and no distractions can do this so much faster than any person can and do it further and further away into the future and coordinate with other cars ideally in an sdc environment my car would slow and so would the passing car so that we would all reach the merge point staggered slightly without us the passengers even realizing it even if they all drive perfectly what if something happens their sensors can not see tire blows out causing a car to swerve anything eadd programming would solve this and we would never even know btw the passing car never flinched either he had depleted uranium balls or he never even saw anything and never knew how close he came to being whacked by that car swerving to miss the deer

131,swerving is not pointless it works quite well if you know how to do it know how to keep control of your car know the limits of your car and yourself and are paying enough attention and this is the important bit and why swerving is usually pointless in advance to be able to react to something you need to react too if you are reacting at the last second no swerving will usually not help you just brake as best you can it is interesting to note that when abs brakes came out rear end collisions when down but head on and other collisions went up before you would slam on the brakes swerve but still go straight because you were sliding abs retained wheel grip control so you were able to swerve and get whacked another way because you had no idea where you were swerving into
