0,well depends what were talking about if were talking private cars its definitely not the solution if were talking public transport it does have an impact im working in this field trying to test autonomous shuttles in connection with existing connections it would make public transport cheaper safer more inclusive and more efficientit would indeed make jobs disappear but part of them will further exist just în the office looking at a few shuttles at a time also we are studying on demand transport and are trying to have a lead start with this before uber and co so that it stays public at the same time we are trying to see how the gathered data can help us its a field worth exploring even if we dont yet know what all the advantages are it could at some point make owning a car obsolete since you can just call a bus through an app
1,i think people are quick to become alarmist about new tech because their lives are already intruded upon by advertisers and big corps using data to predict purchases suggest products and learn who we are as consumers i think a lot of people myself included and definitely those who sub to ranticonsumption are those who are trying to actively decrease their spending or their need to buy a vehicle that uses this tech directly contradicts this philosophy its not about growing a backbone and i think thats kind of a rude way of putting it would you tell an alcoholic to grow a backbone as they drive by a bar or liquor store every night would you tell someone with an obesity problem to grow a backbone as they pass a cinnabon every morning before work those examples arent perfect because anticonsumption isnt a disease in the way those are but its the same idea if you want to spend less you actively try to remove factors in your life that would promote or encourage consumption less stops at the gas station or target using adblocker skipping commercials using dvr reducing the amount of television watched and in this case actively avoiding routes that could cause your budget to go out of flux when your car suggests something that you dont really need also on the tech side who is to say that the algorithm would change if you decline to visit the storerestaurant it suggests from the article it could be that drivers and passengers can instruct cars to avoid certain destinations putting aside the question of why we should be imposed upon like this at all if the car were to drive to those verboten destinations anyway thats probably wrong recall in isaac asimovs novels that the second law of robotics is to always obey human orders where they dont violate the first rule to not cause or allow harm to humans however resisting humans is a major point of autonomous cars we humans are often error prone and reckless while algorithms and unblinking sensors can physically drive better than us in most if not all cases an automated vehicle is designed precisely to disregard our orders where they are imminently risky thats to say refusing human orders is sometimes a feature not a bug its unclear then whether opting out of certain destinations or opting in is reason enough for cars to comply with those commands
2,wed yet to prove that autonomous cars are statistically safer than manned cars there simply isnt enough data to conclude anything at this point if it turns out theyre only marginally safer then no i would not support a ban
3,you bring up good points i actually work on lidar for vehicles in my current position and so far i dont know of any oems that plan to rely on only one sensor type for the autonomous driving systems besides tesla using vision only lidar has its place in the sensor suite but a lot of the hard work happens at the sensor fusion level and the ai built into the computers taking all the sensor data in and processing it those systems can identify when they are in a situation where the lidar is not the most reliable sensor to take data in and adjust accordingly in the short term lidar is an improvement in safety for collision detection and automatic breaking systems to avoid the collision vs the existing sensors so it helps to enable the intermediate autonomous driving levels before getting to fully autonomous operation
4,using what i now of the communications industry going through a digital communications class right now and the cars the term ultrasonic mean anything beyond hertz ultrasound can go up to mhz hz thats a large spectrum to work off of we can eliminate higher to mhz for fm radio frequencies due to interference from high power radio towers the am spectrum khz to khz can also be eliminated due to hobbyist usage and corporate am towers this still leaves us with a large spectrum if the car detects another car using the same frequency a frequency hop using a different frequency wouldnt be too hard a simple fix would be to have each car send out an identification number and what frequency its using so they could orchestrate frequencies for themselves then the computer can adjust its own band pass filters as for receiving the wrong set of data depending on the clock cycle how many actions a computer performs a second it could have a wait and see period lets assume a clock cycle of mhz actions a second lets make the computer transmit a signal every khz for a duration of khz thats on half the time and off half the time meaning a total of pulses if the receiver is suddenly receiving more and a certain allowable error lets say so pulses the computer will detect and issue and likely frequency hop to avoid such errors but take it with a grain of salt im still a student in this field
5,you could simply give each car a different random number generator for the frequency jumps in case you are not familiar computers cannot generate actually random numbers instead we use a pseudo random number generator essentially we take some rapidly changing input often we use the system time measured in milliseconds from some time in the i think s look up unix time if you want specifics then pass that through an algorithm that creates a random looking output there are standards for what qualifies as a random looking output but essentially output must be evenly distributed on some range and not correlated in an obvious way to inputs ie inputs close in value do not necessarily yield outputs close in value or predictably separated these pseudo random number generation algorithms can generally take what is called a seed that is used in the calculation this seed basically consists of some data so it could be anything from an integer to a sentence or anything else the number generation algorithm just views it as some binary data and can usually use a seed of any length because this seed is used in the calculation each unique seed will generate a unique sequence of outputs so to get back to the point if each car uses a different seed its vin number for example in its random number generator for jumping frequencies you would be guaranteed that no two cars would ever generate the same sequence of numbers of course this does not technically guarantee that they wont generate the same outputs for some finite amount of time say outputs in a row but it makes the chances even smaller than before and guarantees that they would not generate the same output indefinitely
6,yes if the cars are sharing data then cars could react to things they cant yet sense going around a corner a lead car or a car coming from another direction could detect an animal in the road and tell the cars behind it to slow down maybe there are changing road conditions like a puddle mudslide ice etc this would not only make other self driving cars safer but it would potentially give human drivers more time to react leading to fewer secondary accidents pileups also as of last year googles car used lidar for small details which has problems in the rain snow so a car might not be able to accurately sense the road conditions until the traction control system tells the car about it which doesnt happen until the tires actually drive over the surface synced cars would make them all safer by giving them more data to base their decisions on
7,i could also see this being open to abuse what is to stop a person transmitting rogue data to other cars slowing down instructions for example
8,it might be but it certainly isnt the only cause tbi has a very high correlation with depression at any stage in life even if the tbi occurred a long time ago and especially if it occurs during childhood development as unfortunately is my situation one moderate http enwikipediaorgwikitraumatic_brain_injuryseverity tbi at age one mild tbi concussion at age and a lifetime of treatment depression to follow despite no significant family history of even mild depression sports players are a common case study given the high occurrence of concussion and other tbi american football players have provided a large amount of data for a link between concussions and depression http srcmp theres also evidence that repetitive subconcussive impacts may cause permanent brain damage similar to that caused by tbi eg the impact of heading a ball in soccer http thechartblogscnncomsoccer heading may cause brain damage
9,i was wondering what you thought about using ai to aid in policy decisions especially ones that have the potential to be evidence driven like climate or healthcare policy ibms project debater can already research subjects and argue foragainst positions and does its background research much faster than any politician could i dont think ai could ever replace elected representatives but do you think it should be used to inform representatives about the multiple sides of the issues they need to vote on and what do you think the consequences positive and negative of mixing ai and policy could be for example could they replace lobbying groups informing politicians about issues without mixing in money and personal relations or are they limited because they do not have a conscience and are simply sophisticated opiniondata gathering machines
10,given your research area are you cautious with the level of data you allow to be collected about yourself directly or indirectly in everyday life if so what sort of precautions do you take
11,welcome do you foresee the development of some form of standardized ethical framework or procedural framework for training dataset developmentutilization that addresses some of the more common inherited bias issues with machine learning
12,so the way algorithms were written previously was the programmer had to explicitly specify a set of rules the systems should follow what a program should do if faced with a certain condition these rule based systems worked reasonably well but if the software came across a situation that the programmer had not accounted for the software fils whats happening now is that ai is able to learn on its own from past data further it can continue to learn and better itself when faced with new situations just like humans without the need of explicit intervention from the programmer this is the domain of machine learning a subfield of ai consider an example of building a system to diagnose diseases the old approach also called expert systems approach would require interviewing doctors and going through many medical books to come with explicit rules that predict the disease given the symptoms the new way with machine learning is to look at historical data of patients their symptoms and the diagnosis made by doctors for them it will on its own learn those symptoms that predict a persons disease from the data the learning approach is proving to be far more effective than the older approach
13,i am somewhere in between i use technology a lot but i have limited what kinds of data technology will have access to i dont discuss politics on social media or share deeply personal things on it i do use fb to follow what friends are up to and to share things id feel comfortable sharing with large groups i use twitter li solely for media consumption or professional posts i use the incognito mode when i am worried about confidentiality i do have alexa but wont use it in my bedroom i experimented with creating a smart home connected tv bulbs thermostats etc but concluded that the benefits werent worth it for me i no longer use it i am not saying any of these are right for you or anyone else but my overall take is that we cant live as tech luddites we should embrace technological progress but we should understand how they work and what can go wrong and we should draw a line somewhere that line might be at different places for different people but we shouldnt just passively use these systems without any deliberate consideration of pros cons
14,important issue discussed in multiple chapters in my book how algorithms ai affect politics i our views are influenced by the media that algorithms on fb google youtube curate for us evidence suggests that they show us more content that confirm our views and lock us into echo chambers which in turn creates social fragmentation this is a huge concern i have written more about it here echo chamber its possible to build algorithms that help diversify our news consumption and there is a lot of effort focused on that today i discuss some of those efforts in my book ii in fb replaced human editors with an algo to curate trending news stories the trending topics algorithm failed to question the credibility of sources and inadvertently promoted fake news the result was that inaccurate and often fabricated stories were widely circulated in the months leading up to the us presidential election according to one estimate the top false stories in that period received greater engagement on facebook than the top legitimate ones iii hypothetical possibilities based on solid research in facebook conducted a study in which they tweaked their newsfeed algorithm to show some users more hard news think more war in iraq and less cats fitting in boxes they then measured how many of these users clicked the i voted button that most of us saw at the top of our facebook feed in november they compared the self reported voter turnout of this group against a control group whose newsfeed algorithm had not been modified the researchers found that users who had their news feed algorithm tweaked increased their voting turnout by three percentage points from for the control group to for the treatment group might not sound like much but the outcomes of elections including the us presidential election in are frequently determined by smaller amounts how politics affects aialgorithms there are already regulators calling for ai regulation in general the left is asking for greater regulation some of these proposals are focused on the use of consumer data by firms for example senator warren has asked for regulation regarding user data sharing the right is overall asking for fewer regulations and then there bipartisan initiatives such as the one by senators klobuchar and kennedy with regard to algorithms and ai there are some proposals as well how the politics plays out and who gets elected will influence how easily firms are able to roll out new ai
15,im of the view that while individual effort alone will not solve this problem we actually do have some amount of power here and that power is in the form of our knowledge our votes and our dollars in terms of knowledge the idea is somewhat straightforward but i think its under appreciated which is becoming aware of the technologies were using and whats happening behind the scenes with them instead of being very passive users of technologies and algorithms more deliberate choices should be made we have to ask ourselves how algorithms change the decisions were making or that others are making about us if you look at what facebook is doing they announced changes to their products how theyre going to support encryption of messages and support short lived posts that disappear afetr some time i think thats a direct outcome of pushback from users the other is our votes and basically backing representatives who understand the nuances here and who take consumer protection seriously in just the last year or two there have been a number of us senators and representatives who proposed bills related to privacy and algorithm bias and so on and being aware of whos doing what in the voting decisions and finally with dollars the idea is vote with your wallet we ultimately have the option to walk away from these tools so if we feel like a company is using our data and we dont find it acceptable for some people that might be where they draw the line and walk away all that said i think individual action wont suffice tech firms have to cooperate and regulators need to push them to do so without going overboard with regulation
16,i have a whole chapter in my book where i propose a consumer bill of rights to better protect society in case things go wrong the key pillars in it are i greater transparency regarding data used by algo ii explanations regarding the primary factors driving algo decision iii keep the human in the loop and give them some control iv audit algos by a team that is independent of the team that developed the algo sorry there isnt enough time to dive in but hope that gets you an initial sense more details in my book
17,sorry for brief answer out of time number crunching analyzing facts collecting facts routine tasks are all easily automated creative tasks tasks which need eq are harder jobs tied to data science creating ai are also protected look at the book by brynjolfsson and mcafee that discusses some of this
18,old approaches of ai could have had lines because they consisted of rules written by humans with modern ai cpecifically machine learning a program with just lines of code can do very advanced things most of the intelligence is in the data and the lines of code are often limited
19,in a driverless car scenario the first car would spot the rock and signal to the cars behind them cars dont have to be driverless to support this in fact it would probably be a lot easier to switch to pervasive peer to peer communication of sensor data between cars than to driverless cars the points about reaction times and mechanical delays are better arguments for driverless cars
20,you could go even higher both the ghz and ghz spectrums are open very high data rates gbps range upwards of km but are los
21,yes and no cryptography in general is not designed to be slow though some cryptography is designed to be slow for example when used to protect passwords the idea being that a slow algorithm wont matter to a user who has the password as a short delay is hardly noticeable for an attacker trying thousands of possible combinations on the other hand a slight delay per try will add up radically increasing the amount of time it takes to arrive at the correct password when it comes to algorithms designed for communications though speed is an important factor think about mobile cell phones ok this example is encryption rather than signing but it illustrates the point if each bit of data was encrypted using a slow algorithm parts of the conversation would soon start to get dropped a slow algorithm would be impracticable there are many algorithms out there and choosing the correct one is often a case of weighing up speed versus the security required for the job at hand more secure algorithms are generally speaking slower tldr there are lots of cryptographic algorithms some designed to be fast and some to be slow
22,in order to preserve document quality we used only pages which have been curatedfiltered by humansspecifically we used outbound links from reddit which received at least karma this can be thought of as a heuristic indicator for whether other users found the link interesting whether educational or funny leading to higher data quality than other similar datasets openaicomblogbetter language models talktotransformercom
23,for my masters in environmental science ive had to show up to weekly seminars and some of them have been genuinely interesting but one guy came in talking about self driving cars and how this would impact future parking he tried to claim his research was for environmental purposes and his data did project that we need to rely on more than natural incentives self driving cars would produce and a few bike lanes to make a real impact on co emissions but when i asked him how his future really even made a world safer for cyclists and pedestrians he had no real answer his research didnt consider noise pollution or that people with self driving cars are more likely to figure out they can just have their car go around the block a few times to get out of parking fees than send it to a cheaper parking garage a few more blocks away than usual that in the world he described it sounded like the streets would become the sole domain of driverless cars that his utopic idea of potential ride sharing with these cars seems antithetical to how the car lobby has operated for decades attempting to get more and more people to buy cars they dont need he had no real idea of how to really envision self driving car improving a day to day commuters experience just the lives of people who already owned cars and it is unfair that a person whose purview is largely data science to consider elements that likely cannot be quantified by data especially for a future which is largely theoretical already but its the fact he hadnt even seemed to have considered those issues is what aggravates me that he was unaware of other larger socio political forces behind why we live in such a car dominant society today it felt indicative that the spokes people for this future havent considered these matters either like self driving cars are in some ways better than people driven cars but the solution isnt better cars its getting rid of them
24,ok just hear me out what if we just create a big database or a cloude if you will where all the cars are connected to then we program them all to comunicate with each other always knowing where the other ones are at any moment like some sort of hive mind based on this information we let them make choices how to best avoid traffic violations we probly need to set some rules in place like never hurt a human or cause a situation where a human can be hurt ofc we always want to be able to make sure we can take manual control so they always have to obey us and since they are expensive they shouldent cus harm to themshelfe well as long as they dont break against the first two rules ofc we also throw in some deep ai learning into that so they can get smarter and find better solutions on problems oh and they should be able to share what they learn so they all get smarter faster its bulletproof
25,orwe get rid of the traffic get rid of offices just let us work from home i dont want a smart car to make my minutes commute into a minute commute i dont want to commute i spend my life doing data analysis and taking zoom meetings i dont need to be in an office my closest full service grocer should not be km away to acres of parking lot most of these issues begin and end with municipal zoning and planning currently in the hands of often volunteer municipal councils with no training or experience in urban planning if you want to automate anything automate city council
26,since we have no clue how cognition ie the abilty to think and reason works in a biological brain we have no ability to create machines that have that ability either deep learning algorithms and neural network software do not and cannot have this ability regardless of how much training data you throw at it a child knows the difference between a real stop sign and a stop sign on someones clothing they also know that a stop sign is still a stop sign even if it has a sticker or some graffitti on it these so called improperly named ais do not know the difference furthermore any so called self driving car that has to randomly pull over to the side of the road and stop then call a remote human operator to guide it manually through whatever it is it cant handle is not in any way shape or form ready to be responsible for the safety of human occupants or be allowed on public roads its all a failed technology that will never be ready for real world use these companies all know this but have invested so much money in the development that they insist on marketing it anyway to recover that money or go bankrupt dont fall for the self driving car meme
27,ever been to las vegas there are a couple of blocks that are literally like that and it sucks walking up and down them all the time ayhtdata m e m saawijpdnfbr cbtzfrwg e i i
28,then you have no clue how far ai has come as long as we have humans at the wheel kids will die its beyond atrocious that you propagate that to be fair i said i trust but i should have said the data already shows that ai is safer you should research some topics before you write out things that arent true
29,on the contrary the more mass market the software a the bigger the threat from lawsuits and b the more data they have to work with when you get in a self driving car you arent getting a driver with years experience youre getting a driver with years experience split across each vehicle in the fleet xb made up numbers you get the idea
30,no all these people dying and crashed into are just the few broken eggs that need to be sacrificed for the data once enough people are plowed into well have the data to make a car utopia
31,if you saw conclusive data that showed fewer crashes per mile would you change your mind youre totally correct humans and computers make different kinds of mistakes but if we knew with certainty that computers make fewer mistakes would you still feel the same way
32,driving is hard and requires a lot of knowledge of not just the rules of the road but an intuition of how to actually drive the road is covered in weird edge cases and computers are just really bad at adapting to new things like imagine youre in a city at a traffic light trying to turn right theres a bicyclist in the same lane as you hes not turning and theres a giant pothole in your normal turn path you can see all of this just through a quick glance youd know alright ill wait for the bicyclist to go then ill turn but ill go slow and dodge the pothole getting a computer to not only detect these things but also respond to them properly is really hard theres no strict rule that governs the situation i just made up but humans can pretty easily apply understanding from similar situations weve seen in the past and our conceptual understanding of why potholes are bad and cyclists have right of way computers have no conceptual understanding of what theyre doing theyre pattern machines show them anything outside the pattern and they break down roads are full of things that dont fit the pattern thats just one major issue and it doesnt even address getting data into the car itself nobody has a good system for that yet all of them have some major issues
33,i found this a few meters from there lol ayhtdata m e m swcttqbqaahwnnsrjehq e i i
34,i buy the argument that we arent properly accounting for the extra road wear for weight but im not convinced they are worse than gas cars just because of that without some more data do you have some that could convince me
35,i think we as a society generally overestimate the issues with point source pollution like mining and grossly underestimate the threat of distributed pollution its kinda the other way around we underestimate point industrial scale point source pollution because we just have no context for it and overestimate consumer pollution because we feel like were more important if you look at the actual data personal vehicle emissions make up less than of yearly co emissions moving all that to electric vehicles would be _better_ sure but its basically a drop in the bucket especially when you counterbalance it with the fact that youd still be burning something somewhere else to power those vehicles
36,number is either wrong or highly misleading because there is no way ships only amount to of pollution caused by transportation when ships owned by carnival corporation emit x more than all cars in europe the source you link only looks at nox no no emissions not all emissions so either youre deliberately trying to be misleading or you didnt understand the source youre referring to heres ourworldindataorgco emissions from transport a source for all the co emissions from all transportation in the world cars dominate all other forms of transportation
37,true it isnt actually even true ourworldindataorgco emissions from transport the people who say that have read an article that exclusively looks at nox no no emissions not all emissions and then go around repeating it everywhere but there are a lot more emissions than just nox emissions
38,animal products increase risk of death from multiple causes so point does apply if you care about deaths as just one example the who lists multiple meats as carcinogens cancer causing point does apply its also affecting climate change apinationalgeographiccomdistributionpublicampenvironmentarticlemeat production leads to thousands of air quality related deaths annually point does apply an animal based diet is more expensive finds vegan meals cheaper than meat and fish theconversationcomvegan vegetarian and flexitarian diets could save you money new research point does apply to all of food production greenhouse gases are from animal products while providing nowhere near of the calories disproportionate impact greenhouses gases food production study theres hundreds of sources proving greenhouse gases from animal products and to say otherwise is to deny science point applies to all animal farming some just take up even more than others look up trophic levels and you will see you feed animals a lot more than you get out of them in terms of calories that means either growing more crops to feed them than if you ate the crops directly or giving them a lot of land to graze on or a mixture of both all of which result in a lot more land use a tiny percentage of livestock land couldnt be used for anything else ourworldindataorgland use diets i didnt want to flood my comment with hundreds of sources so ive just included a few of the thousands out there that back up the points i made nope it was an honest question because most subs have people like you who deny science so i was seeing whether this sub was a fit for vegans or not so far the people ive interacted with its on either side the other person who replied to me put it really well the reasons given in this post would lead to people reducing their intake of animal products not necessarily elimination obviously to go vegan you need the animal ethics too so my question maybe should have been worded differently i assume people are already reducing intake of animal products based on their morals and why they are here some even vegan so im guessing this is a vegan friendly place i guess that would have been a better thing for me to say you are the one who brought their anti vegan and anti science discussion here from me asking a question about the people in this sub and whether its a fit for me or not
39,i could work full time in my car during the trips would be amazing with no airport preparedness lack of solid data and voice connection imagine working the whole drive up until your vacation destination http harrisontravelscoukwp contentuploadsarticle eebdc _xjpg
40,i cant believe none of the top comments have discussed the number of people moving by plane vs how many vehicles would be on the road if driverless cars were in enough quantity to actually disrupt the airline industry million people per day are currently flying domestically million total if you include international and at most domestically those are about hour trips coast to coast or far shorter on average my guess is average flight in the us is about hours but i lack official data so each person is traveling hours to their destination per their day of travel hours on a flight will be conservatively at mph roughly miles very low estimate this hours via car would be hours of driving non stop but of course we need to stop for gaselectric charge or for bathrooms and food i figure a hour mile trip by car at mph average would be closer to hours the low average capacity of commercial flights is people can travel miles in hours using airlines million people can travel miles in hours per day so lets say half the current people flying decide to start traveling via driverless vehicles person can drive miles in hours people can drive miles in hours people can drive miles in hours per day xb now imagine traffic is increase by people increasing main freewayinterstate travel congestion by over million hours per day spread out across the states i cant fathom this ever making a dent in airline travel because enough people realistically switched to driverless cars on average wed see significant increase in travel times traffic congestion etc lastly why is nobody comparing airline flight environmental impact and driverless cars environmental impact plane going hours vs vehicles going hours
41,this whole thing would get more traction if they would make a concentrated effort to hash out the legal responsibilities involved in these incidents i dont want to share the road with a bunch of assholes who hide behind an army of lawyers strong arming settlements for the hundreds of deaths that will occur maybe also show peer reviewed third party data defending the ass pull numbers the guy who stands to benefit from to the tune of millions of dollars maybe also prove that you have sufficient protections in place for the computer part to secure it from hackers
42,can someone comment on the cybersecurity of these sorts of systems with the recent facebook activity coming to light and home automation getting very big im hoping that data misuse and gathering wont be a problem here in the future but being realistic it probably will happen to some extent im worried that similar abuses could happen with autonomous vehicles
43,i know that autonomous cars are safer i have been following the studies and growth of the technology for years just as a curious hobbyist not an expert but there will come a time when a person or group of people is killed by an autonomous car and it will be all over the news and there will be a lot of people in the camp of i just dont trust them robot cars the data will not matter because even though autonomous cars are safer than human drivers there will be people who will wish for the system of human choice over the cold unfeeling determinism of machines
44,its not just a matter of logic combine the algorithm with insurance risk and micro targeted data and were not far away from the car choosing to mow down half a dozen shop workers on the pavement to avoid the hedge fund manager crossing the road
45,perhaps knowing that there is a potential risk and nobody to blame but a machine pedestrians will get off their phones and be aware of their surroundings as they walk around this may skew the data when it comes to accidents though kind of a placebo effect making the self driving vehicles appear to be even safer than they arefor a while anywaywishful thinking
46,yep like when people dont wanna accept that legal guns in the us save more lives than illegallegal guns kill including suicide and they downvote this post kinda proving me right we have data on this but you choose to ignore just like the people youre complaining about who say self driving cars arent saver because it goes against their worldview youre guilty of the exact same thing
47,since the factors behind doubt it the factors should be reproduceable based upon simple logging so you even get to infinity war game a failed scenario with tweaked code until it passes source me i log enough data to reproduce live events in test
48,data or gtfo
49,would be kind enough to share the data
50,the cdc lists gun deaths for the nhtsa lists automobile deaths for deaths increase releasesusdot releases fatal traffic crash data
51,not true uber released intentionally dark footage and none of their lidar data to make it seem like they werent at fault but any human driver would have been able to see that person and lidar definitely should have seen it uber is shit and shouldnt have been able to test on public streets in the first place human drivers had to correct the vehicle on average every miles yeah walking in front of cars is dumb but it still could have been prevented
52,there is little reason cars should not be in communication with each other like an ad hoc mesh atc network we just need to reach critical mass of ai driven cars the cars who are linked can share data about pedestrians road hazards and non controlled vehicles on the road the software to accomplish that is straightforward but nontrivial to implement even standard driver controlled vehicles could contribute camera data and benefit from a digital model of the road ahead for example to see hazards over the hill or around the curve ahead through a hud system
53,i understand and am responding to what you wrote a human must take active responsibility because of a dangerous situation once every which means with no human interaction there would beon the extremely limited dataset of the technology of today which is also getting better with every mile drivenone accident however ive years of drivingwith federal government trainingand i have to take constant action to avoid accidents in situations created by other drivers and other drivers are not getting better they are getting more numerous therefore if a human only has to take correction once every miles that means there is less opportunity for humans to screw it up when called upon to do the right thing now imagine a world in the near future where there is a greater percentage of automated cars which reduces the ratio of better drivers there will be less accidents and less incidents for with the cars will have to respond ergo a safer experience your figures support that conclusion
54,it shouldnt datafatality analysis reporting system fars every _single_ fatal accident on our roadways has a nhtsa report generated everyone of these reports can be viewed online this includes things like driver and vehicle statistics but condition of the roadway position of passenger in vehicle sequence of events during the accident and whether or not the person was airlifted the hospital and the amount of time it took ive downloaded the fars database and created a program that will allow me to make queries against this data you can ask for example how many times had a car gone airborne before finally coming down and killing a pedestrian times in one incident it involved a pedestrian and his dog walking on a _different_ road that the vehicle departed from anyways as a result it shouldnt be a surprise that we already pay very close attention to vehicle safety and that the number of lives lost given the trillions of miles driven every year will be amazingly low _suicide_ claims more lives in a year than car accidents hell car accidents dont even make the top causes of deathhtm
55,ai will brake thats it its not going to jump the curb its not going into oncoming traffic to save lives youre right it never happens on top of that there will be no decision making path is obstructed brake if it hits someone a person would have hit that someone and a lot harder and faster and that someone was in the wrong thats of the people who will die to automated cars it will be because they stepped into the road way illegally and the car makers will eat those people alive in the court rooms should they decide to sue with all the data those cars will record the ai will just brake that is all
56,oh an autonomous vehicle sees a possible collusion should it a apply the breaks b access the internet run the forward cameras latest image through a face recognition database compare all detected results and weigh their lives against the drivers registered info and determine who is most worth saving make some decision that for some mysterious reason isnt apply the breaks oh yeah totally a trolley problem
57,my background is in developing algorithms for data analysis banking and investments but my programming skills amount to a well trained script kiddie at best so im finding it quite difficult simply from a programming perspective i understand the concepts at a much higher level than my educators but stumble hard on implementation i think most programs ive looked into teach the concepts well but infosec is a lot more commoditized than machine learning so if you dont plan to rise to the top youll have more demand and opportunity in infosec with a basic level of understanding everyone needs a secure database but few people need a simple neural network would you happen to have any recommendations for learning to program more as a subconscious reflex im very goal oriented so doing more exercises for the sake of exercises kills me inside python
58,in most countries in the world local variations in laws will be interesting for self driving cars i know some cities have rather unique traffic ordinances governing things like like merging between cars in a funeral procession wonder how the cars will maintain those databases of laws let alone the wisdom of guessing if a procession is a funeral procession based on subtle queues like the absence of flowery decorations that might make you know it was a wedding party
59,im not a futurist but im going to sound like one future caught up to reality the current tesla has full autopilot as in you could sleep in it the issue is that legally tesla cant deploy the technology until they get x number of hoursmiles showing their technology is or times better than a human driver it has fully redundant cpus in the new version not running current nvidia and musk has more or less said this is checkmate the level and precision to which he describes it makes me believe him ive seen him exaggerate claims of doing x before some date this isnt that they have of the driving data collected on the road its not perfect technology you arent either youre a shitty driver its better than you and were going to hit a point where we have to acknowledge that and its gonna be uncomfortable heres an interview he recently did with an mit ai researcher vdevvxkjvi
60,teslas smart because all of their user data is collected pre crash so no one can sue them for dumb shit on the highway i take to work a driver fell asleep at the wheel auto pilot didnt know if he was exiting and ended up crashing into the median his family tried to sue tesla but they said hed been given several visual and audible warnings but his hands hadnt touched the wheel in six seconds talk about a cya
61,for some values of fully automated driving waymo is but uber killed someone after about million miles driven the national average is per million miles sure its a single data point but it definitely doesnt reinforce a blanket statement of fully automated driving is already safer than human driving
62,worked in insurance for years made it to lower senior management in two global corporations and have a diploma in insurance really im a totally interesting and swell guy who absolutely didnt own several different shades of grey suit honest im going to say on this one that i disagree an insurance company is in the business of lowering risk exposure against premium charged in order to increase their profit margin essentially the less they have to pay out the better sometimes they do this with good advice to the customer based on their knowledge of what likely causes of loss are particularly type of door lock or burglar alarm works better they will advise you fit it and can lower your premium accordingly they know with those youre less likely to have a loss and they get to keep more premium across the pool of risks they insure every year anyway currently to insure a car they have to assess individual drivers ability lifestyle carelessness decision making skills location commute type of parking level of car usage type of use and experience some they can ask you some they can use big data to figure the trends but in a lot of cases they simply cant know as much about you as you know about you so their premium charged has to guess and factor that in i worked on multiple books of motor insurance that had a combined operating ratio money in verses money out of over you need less than to be making money and these were the big insurance companies with the really good systems low operating costs internal efficiencies and damn good actuaries in the uk the motor industry lost money every year for over a decade i dont know the stats these daystheyd make up for it in other areas for an insurance company where in the uk it is compulsory for a driver to have at least third party liability to cover you damaging other things or people theres simply a lot of stuff that you the driver could do that they cant account for in their numbers but will have to pay for if you screwed up but an automatic car not owned by an individual but by company trying to run a profit themselves with known software and hardware combinations known and predictable use cases secure storage facilities regular maintenance and user feedback reporting and a large data set provided by the company themselves that reports all incidents and not just the ones that the drivers do actually report thats going to lead to a much more predictable loss data set and you have a company to sue when it goes wrong suing a regular person for the money they dont have can be a hiding to nothing so the way i see it insurance companies cant wait to get their hands on the business model of automated drive and fleet pool car operations where the unknown human element is a much more manageable in the insurance press its been a topic of discussion for years with some people actually thinking the biggest resistance wont come from the insurance companies but from the population resisting having their freedom to drive taken away from them and from governments that will be slow to unpack the current insurance legislation and open it up to allow innovation in the market the insurance companies want more money for their shareholders they often do it by slicing the back end operation which i in operations hated them for it made people their own staff have worse quality lives all so the shareholders could benefit paying less in claims is a much much more lucrative option and may even stop them for a while from carving into themselves for the extra cash i think they want the automation they wont resist it its way too much good money
63,there are so many options to solve this problem both in the interim whilst existing manual cars still exist and once theyre all auto and its illegal to drive manually so firstly why would they clog the streets youd have less cars per person so existing parking spaces would free up or could simply be used to store the car until a job becomes available another option is orbiting the busiest cityarea link this in with internet communication and a company can live track where the traffic is and orbit in different areas or if one car pulls out of a parking spot another can take its place immediately in the longer term computers and data mining can begin to predict how many cars are required in certain areas in certain times and simply drive away into the country side or into custom built banks to recharge and be cleaned during down hours like and this sort of thing happens in the uk with the power grid when its half time at the world cup we have to spin up more generators because everyone puts the kettle on at the same time and causes a huge surge im sure therell be aches and pains as with any new system but ultimately theyre all solvable with digital technology and physical infrastructure underground parking lots for empty autos or just out of town parking structures specialist highways for empty autos
64,so yeah me spending part of my day yesterday in this sub having a thoughtful conversation about deep sea autonomous boats for data collection was part of an act and im just here to stalk a mod who posts k upvote stories everyday there is no benefit to anyone to share this dudes stupidity and it is both the driver and the ops goal to get people watching the stunt which should be ignored and shunned for its danger and me saying something about it and getting a modicum of support has pissed you the hell off because apparently you really like the video too i wouldnt know truthfully because all youve done it attack me but ill infer until i hear otherwise for the dozenth time this story is trash and sharing it at all is encouraging stunt drivers to get more attention for life risking behavior the tech is cool and has potential show it off on private property imagine a bulletproof glass company decided to stand at the edge of their property and fire at their glass toward a public street filled with cars would you be cool with sharing that video i mean the tech had been proven right
65,so initially theyd cannibalize the existing transport system or are you going to try to claim buses and taxis dont have a business from monday to friday im claiming that if taxis were cheaper than owning more people would already use a taxi the reason uber has surge pricing is because taxis dont work when everyone needs a car at the same time its really a non issue youre not renting it out to strangers and the company who is leasing it would provide protections your transition scenario is renting to strangers no economic compensation fixes this you getting a different car from your vomited car that someone else vomited in a month earlier but was cleaned out by the leasing company before sending it to you doesnt help the problem solves itself through the free market no the free market converges to our current system because people already have chosen not to use rental cars or taxis sorry are you saying the subscription service will be more expensive than owning the car it has to be the only way a commute without carpooling works is if everyone has a car that means the rental company has to buy a car for everyone uber and taxis already shows the total market for ride sharing to use nyc data there are about k streamers fully saturating the market of million people thats at best because nyc isnt as dependant on commuters as other cities so a streaming service at best has to buy cars that wont make a profit or each of the hundred cars makes profit same thing self driving taxi cant pay the lease payments for cars that means a streaming company would have to charge more for a car rental to make a profit compared to you buying your own car if its not cheaper than ownership it is completely not viable exactly its not viable its the reason people buy rather than uber or rent the cases where it makes sense to rent a car for an entire year to commute every day is tiny
66,i dont buy the assumption that self driving cars are safer where is the long term data
67,but i also feel like theres gotta be a lot of people that need organs because of a car crash eg self driving cars would prevent us from needing so many organ donations i have zero data to back this up and could very well be wrong
68,most of their crash data showed it was older people who traditionally bought american who had bought a prius after the cash for clunkers program it wasnt a car thing it was stupid fucking drivers just like audi in the s i mean what exactly changed in the floor mat design that crash proofed the car nothing nothing changed but you cant go on national tv and say most old biddies are fucking retarded
69,it would be nice if there could be autonomous only roads i imagine a lot of the risk is from detection errors having a standard signaling protocol for cars to pull exact data about their positioning and entities surrounding them would be a huge advantage makes the ai driver extremely simple
70,thats a nearly religious statement youve no data for that you cant its faith in computers and their superiority beta software should not drive cars
71,i used to agree with the idea in the title now after seeing the accidents coming from tesla and uber im not so sure that were using a good enough safety framework even if we allow the code to be closed source we should allow the general public a way to find and submit bugs currently theres a pilot in these cars and heshes supposed to take over in case something goes wrong yet in the uber case the driver wasnt paying attention id make it mandatory to have a system in the car that alerts the driver if hes distracted farm distracted driver detection and exceeding a quota should be treated as reckless driving another thing im suggesting is a database of all accidents where a self driving car was involved and if the police can provide a way to recreate the conditions of an accident all makers of self driving cars need to pass all previously known tests before releasing major updates
72,why does everyone just assume things are secure and wont ever be used maliciously we cant even keep hotel door locks from being hacked or a a simple database with peoples information secure but we want a complicated software system in charge of a vehicle this is a vicious cycle every time something new comes out medical tech wifi whatever corporations fail to think about security first they designed wireless insulin pumps and pacemakers with few if any security protocols in place lets put million cars on the road with that same philosophy good idea
73,complete and utter bullshit if these corporations cant find the money and resources to do this safely then they need to find another business it is absolutely possible to simulate the environment they aim to operate in they just need the data which they should be paying to collect en masse this is no different to developing any other critical system you simulate the production environment and test in it before you deploy to production proper its in the article title they are trying to do autonomous vehicles on the cheap at the expense of human lives by slamming underdeveloped models into production i say they can take their lobbyists and piss off in the interim to reduce deaths on the roads governments need to make it difficult to get and maintain a licence as what passes for driving nowadays is pathetic theres way too many on the roads that have no aptitude for defensive driving for those who agree with the bullshit are you happy to be one to drive one of these underdeveloped models and sacrifice your life for the greater good
74,i think the issue here is that we are seeking or expecting perfection within the logic of self driving cars as a software architect i do believe that the expectation is incorrect and unrealistic the realistic expectation here is that at least version of the cars should be more safer than the current averages which i do believe that currently autonomous self driving cars are way ahead of the current averages moving forward i think distributed network over cars in which all cars are aware and can communicate with other cars to share data and details about visibility speed alerts etc would be a great benefit and will increase the accuracy of the module even better in the meantime i think self driving cars should be tested and rolled out as they are the testing data that was provided by the car owners is not enough the public needs to start testing and using these cars in every day practice this is the only way we can stabilize and improve this product the public testing of these autonomous cars is the realistic test the technology will improve x the rate when we start a beta testing with retail according to the realistic expectations set i think self driving cars will be a great success cant wait
75,of course anything is better than a bad or drunk human driver but is there data supporting the idea that a robot car is superior to a mediocre or good driver who pays attention to what is happening around him and expects the possibility of surprises
76,suppose one person was killed each day in each state for an entire year that would be deaths that year still reducing vehicle fatalities by compared to last years data wikipedia enmwikipediaorgwikimotor_vehicle_fatality_rate_in_us_by_year as i think about the deaths most likely to be caused by a transition to automation i believe it will become more obvious that out of a result of human error more often than not
77,driving ai needs real world data to improve you cant hold it in development hell for decades until you can release a finished product which is why tesla is heading in the right direction ever car is collecting data and sending it up
78,thats the thing the car is always watching and has a ton of video and data to pretty much recreate the accident to know who was at fault and im sure they have insurance just like any other vehicle
79,going to have to wait a long long time before we get enough data to make a statistically relevant comparison
80,milions of people all over the planet now own a vehicle that can transport you wherever you need to go with the only effort on your part being to haul your carcass in and out of it we have voice activated devices like google home that can control every aspect of our house with just a few simple commands were surrounded by convenience were already lazy slobs this same logic was used to try and prevent vehicles existing in the first place how can you then try and apply it to what essentially boils down to just increased convenience you know what i can actually provide data to back this up the service industry comprises of the worlds economy and in countries like france and the us its basically enwikipediaorgwikilist_of_countries_by_gdp_sector_composition enwikipediaorgwikilist_of_countries_by_gdp_sector_composition
81,the real advancements will come with distributed inter car communication as mentioned above imagine all the cars on the a certain road as a interconnected network of sorts each car talks to its neighbors in real time about its position and speed with inter car communication cars may be able to communicate with neighboring cars and sense possible problems about to occur if a car gathers information from another car heading towards it with speed and relative position data it can calculate the forthcoming collision and try to prevent it this sort of system would make collisions very rare and would be a significant advantage over human drivers
82,still way more limited than teslas ability to gather data
83,machine learning will take care of insurance claims download data run its function out the claims
84,i think this is over played its hard to base a safety case upon sensors extrinsic to the vehicle because its difficult to verify data integrity in any case the vehicle must be safe in isolation eg it must pass an elk test in fog at night either by seeing through the fog or driving within the limits of its sensors intra vehicle data cannot replace conventional signals because human drivers are still legal at eis so the manoeuvre cadence cant increase vehicle manufacturers have little incentive to share data because if eg fords cooperate with fords then network effects will favour big players freeze out disruptive new entrants legislation may therefore be required to force sharing however integrity is harder if the standard is open this sort of distributed asynchronous system is really hard to police no i dont think blockchain is the solution i suppose it could be done with public key cryptography a really big database of vins but then integrity verification would depend on internet access which might not be dependable eg in tunnels or remote areas i therefore think it will be limited to more controlled environments like road trains controlled by single operators or non safety critical uses better traffic data for strategic routing decisions as distinct from tactical manoeuvre decisions
85,this will never happen because the latencies and low quality data channels involved preclude it
86,humans dont have phone screens mr data
87,also do you really want some company tracking and selling data about everywhere you go and everything you do while in their cars because i guarantee you they will
88,theres k road deaths in the us if automated cars bring that down to k they work great even though they kill k people wed have zero traffic deaths if we just teleported everywhere but id still wanna see some data on how that would occur but yes that sure would be nice and is impossible to be against as a concept
89,well its just a steering controlecu issue the car is using steering wheel angles swa and reference points to calculate the angle of the steering wheel perfectly horizontal and center steering is angle and making calculations to turn the steering wheel to the left or right in your timestamp the car is making a left lane change to get into the left turn lane so the wheel is turning left and then countersteering to the right to get back to the center or swa essentially its what humans would do but we dont have to worry about calculations or algorithms when we turn the wheel its smooth but the car is trying to turn the wheel and then counter turn the wheel all within a few seconds at the end of the day its still a robot the actions it takes are going to be for some part robotic though i would argue that if there is a good collaboration between fca and waymo those steering movements can be much smoother because fca can share data on their internal can system values and ecu configurations
90,you misunderstand first let me clarify my statement i am saying that it would take tesla more than years to create something as confidentreliable as this video with their current hardware and i know they plan on continuing with this hardware as that is their strategy and they have been promising fsd with this current hardware take a company that is pretty good at innovating i agree tesla is great at innovating and an extremely exciting company however for them to create what you see in this video with their hardware and strategy will several times harder than what waymo has done it will require vastly more technology breakthroughs that are not in the foreseeable future if tesla were to drop their current strategy and hardware and start over and create a waymo clone i am sure they could do that in years or so but they do not intent to do that when you have pretty much half a million cars or more collecting driving data worldwide on edge cases sigh you and everyone else have got to drop this man its a useful tool but is really far less relevant and important than you believe waymo has at last publishing in a fleet of vehicles even if they quadrupled that its still less than vehicles out in the wild collecting data irrelevant i dont think its a hardware issue at this time its more getting the software right yes but when you have less hardware redundancies the software doesnt need to be a little better it needs to be x x times better k people that already bought it its going to be a massive change only k its gotta be higher than this tesla is selling k vehicles per quarter years is probably my best case idea for teslas software to be at this level we are seeing i share your excitement and enthusiasm its fun to dream i agree wouldnt that be something if that turned about to be the case but i hope you arent getting in to deep into the fantasy
91,why is teslas adaptive cruise control so bad considering the amount of data they harvest
92,well if nothing else well get our first real data on how safe these vehicles actually are albeit in limited scenarios it will be interesting to see if they report how frequently their mission control or whatever its called has to intervene as well exciting times
93,its has been used for years you can youtube plenty of teslas driving around the states themselves currently the law states for insurance purposes that a human must be ready to take control this isnt a new thing this has been around forever its just recently we have access to massive amounts of data to enable this kind of ai the year was no different waymo drove million miles in the state which is not even its primary testing ground its cars disengaged times for a rate of disengagements per miles thats down from in source latest self driving car statistics from california
94,apple doesnt collect nearly as much data as google since apple doesnt run native ads btw if ai starts doing everything for us were gonna be a pretty dumb and useless species
95,so the law will change so if youre in a self driving vehicle you cant be pulled over to your last point theres hundreds of millions of miles of data on these self driving cars already and they have a fatality rate lower than regular cars per miles
96,im not saying steering wheel less vehicles will never exist the infrastructure your describing doesnt exist you know what else doesnt exist full self driving cars that work in most conditions just that they shouldnt exist until maybe of all vehicles on the road are driving themselves fully and the data backs up the assumption that its not needed i dont buy the whole its only a test vehicle well a test vehicle can have a steering wheel
97,i mean we could still have a requirement of insurance for people who own their own self driving cars it would be much easier to provide responsibility with a self driving car too as they have tens of cameras radars ladars etc whos data could be reviewed to find out what went wrong if its a self driving car owned by a fleet company like uber or local taxi company etc then that company would be responsible for insuring their vehicles just like they are currently
98,or its a test to gather some sort of specific data from that kind of experiment who the fuck knows what their team of engineers are planning
99,it is literally a lesser problem because it doesnt affect every driver all the time but still im not arguing that we should ignore the problem im saying that focusing on that problem as the reason we cant do without steering wheels ever is wrong youre good at finding all the details in your argument but ignoring them in mine honestly were still very far from true autonomous driving for a lot of reasons the biggest one being infrastructure we cant predict what the state of self driving tech will be when worrying about the weather becomes one of the big problems they move on to for all we know itll be a non issue that ends up solved by accident as a result of solving a different problem or implementing a new system i guess thats my point the snow problem for a fraction of users for a fraction of the year is not a today problem so we cant look at todays tech to point out why it cant be solved once we solve todays problems well use tomorrows tech to evaluate tomorrows problems hypothetical we end up developing some advanced sensorai system able to navigate unknown routes without needing to reference preset maps and navigation data letting people take side roads and even travel off road then they discover that routine is also able to dynamically update existing navigational data when the system detects unexpected road conditions like snow or road construction no need for a special snow sub system
100,considered by tesla using its own statistics and reporting surely they have nothing to gain by making this argument wake me up when they release raw data to a third party like the nhtsa thats qualified to assess their actual safety record
101,electrekcotesla autopilot safety report improvements despite limited data
102,no no ists not perception and prediction tasks yes anything else is a lot of optimization and higher control theory take eg the local trajectory planning and risk calculation thats simple mathematics these need no ais also behause they are hardly to train as to the best of my knowledge no unbiased data exists to train sich networks but yes the data on which algorithms further down the self driving car pipeline operate are applied and will most lilely always be results of ais
103,from what ive seen mostly from ai addict the programs are overreacting by responding to situations that dont exist or misinterpreting the given situation tesla in particular has trouble because mr musk insists on not using lidar or radar on tesla vehicles which makes things a lot harder for even advanced neural networks to train even with millions of miles of training data
104,just the original image with noise not just any noise youre the one who needs to refresh your memory a dirty camera means theres no input image so if all the cameras somehow became dirty you slow down stop hand off controls to the driver ive been driving tesla for a while now and none of the cameras needed any cleaning yet let alone being completely blind all of them at the same time youre truly grasping at straws here an ml system ultimately needs to be able to think like a human no it doesnt were not going to be able to train every situation thats not how it works modern neural nets compress and generalize knowledge you dont need to train it on literally every road in the world to be useful and the public isnt going to want to get into a car they have no control over if they think its going to kill them again youre making obviously false claims teslas fsd alone has k drivers using it and how many of them have died because of fsd it seems rather ethically dubious to widely release a technology with such glaring issues you have no problem with regular cars that are driven by humans who regularly get drunk get high look at their smartphones text pass out due to health problems dont pay attention somehow you ignore these glaring issues thousand deaths per year in the us alone data and you know why because you accept a certain level of risk just like everyone else
105,im aware not just any noise flip a few strategically chosen pixels and you have an adversarial image the image breaks nns no modern nns dont generalize knowledge which has been the entire point ive been making lol i dont think you have much of an understanding how nns are actually trained or what they actually do if you think theyre compressing knowledge all theyre doing is making statistical correlations fancy curve fitting in higher dimensions thats it theres no learning actually happening no intelligence or thought needed to fit coefficients to data the whole issue with modern nns and most ml today is that they dont generalize outside their training data
106,i feel like this is frustratingly incomplete data are these cars crashing at a higher per mile rate than traditional cars are they killing more people per mile than traditional cars i have no idea and the answer to those two questions is crucial as to how we should be thinking about this
107,this is a misleading title with little to not actual data contained within the article itself were those collisions due to the self driving vehicle failing to avoid obstacles or were they due to other people driving like idiots and running into a completely stationary self driving vehicle cant tell you the number of bikesscooters ive seen ram straight into a parked car for one reason or another
108,its not really a trolley problem though because there are other options most of us would happily damage property over killing someone in practice we might even accept some risk of injury to ourselves if the net outcome is better the typical human responses arent even illogical per se just choosing from the best options based on limited data and processing time we simply dont know enough to make an optimal decision braking often isnt a good option because you could cause a multi car pileup that results in more injury andor death and still not save the pedestrian from life threatening injuries it only works for self driving cars if they have absolute control over themselves and work with each other well
109,the great news is that s of humans crash their cars every day the data is there the opportunity to prove your point is now
110,i hate to say this but ive been saying the system is vulnerable for years not just to this kind of interuption but many many other complications as well and besides its not like it worked very well to begin with this video was taken last year after they released the newest version that musk claimed was full self driving vilhtricwy vilhtricwy also for anyone about to throw statistics in my face consider that these articles found major tampering with statistical data to show a favorable outcome of the technology basically tesla has been hiding crash data and has made several procedural rules to avoid counting a majority of crashes as faults of the self driving system these include not having hands on wheels at all times not sucessfuly avoiding an accident even if you are in self driving mode as well as many other excuses to not count a crash on the data set tesla has been lobbying to make this technology mandated so they can corner the market for years and have been intentionally hiding crash data to make it seem safer than it really is to prove that it should be mandated if you really look you can see countless articles all saying something like this but tesla pr department is good at its job they even pay youtubers to show favorable videos tesla uses youtubers test self driving tech public streets trained safety drivershtml fi hy tesla nhtsa storyhtml fi hy tesla nhtsa storyhtml safety regulators put tesla autopilot safety regulators put tesla autopilot its really simple make this technology an option but never a mandate any vehicle must have full capacity to be manually be driven including mirrors and everything like that its the best of both worlds the people who want it have it and the people who dont arent forced to use it
111,shut the fuck up about how a self driving system that requires years and petabytes of data to train isnt literally perfect yet shut the fuck up every day we dont shift to fully autonomous driving literally hundreds of people die
112,but are anecdotes data of the m miles between accidents in manual mode would be on freeway and m off of it for the m miles in autopilot m would be on freeway and just off of it so the manual record is roughly one accident per m miles off freeway and per m miles on freeway but the autopilot record ballparks to m miles between accidents off freeway and m on freeway in other words about longer without an accident in manual with forward collision avoidance on or tacc than in autopilot instead of being safer with autopilot it looks like a tesla is slightly less safe if i am testing the fsd beta i will probably be paying more attention than i would be actually driving myself its going to make driving so much more fun we know from decades of research that this is not true
113,for such a generalized system like fsd you cant just hire a handful of engineers to test the system the system is trained with huge datasets collected from the whole fleet of drivers there is no other way other than to slowly expand the beta collect more data improve the system and repeat
114,how is that apples to oranges its the entire purpose of developing the tech if the technology is made to improve the safety of driving and doesnt its a problem if the data shows it does then maybe it should be encouraged if you are replacing something a driver with something else a driverless vehicle then it warrants a comparison doesnt it
115,theyre not wrong the easiest way to progress quickly is to move fast and break things thats fine when you accidentally break peoples access for a few hours to large scale knowledge database that has only existed for the last years or so thats not fine when the things you are breaking are users bones bodies and lives tesla takes the attitude of software design sometimes all that said tesla actually does a lot of heavy testing and checks the problem of being at the edge is that theres edge cases that only happen of the time and its really hard to fix remember when toyotas modification of accelerators and mats resulted in a huge amount of accidents to pay million in crash settlement mats still to blame it took over years since the issue was identified and toyota would still deny the obvious teslas engineering is top notch and their cars have had less security issues and better fixes than their competitors throughout the years blame the culture and management but the engineering is top notch human and sometimes making mistakes but as good quality as any other car maker as a matter of fact that will be the problem that self driving cars will have there will be errors and failures that will result in deaths but even if self driving cars do only slightly better than the average youd have to go to tens of thousands of deaths before it wouldnt still be a better idea than not doing it but people dont see it like that its the airplane fallacy someone would rather go drive cross country out of fear of dying on an airplane crash when in reality the moment they have the highest chance of dying on a flight is on the drive to and back from the airport a cross country trip is incredibly dangerous in comparison but because seeing someone die being run over or due to a car crash is an every day occurrence no one really talks about and we dont think but airplane crashes are so rare we obsess over them the safer car gets the more national news a car crash will be in this specific case though musk shot himself on the foot imho had he been less combative this wouldnt have escalated into an issue that is national news the tech is not at a point thats ready to ask for regulation revisits and offering more freedom on it while it may be mature enough that this would be beneficial we really dont have enough data even if tesla is doing it right its not easy to imagine what regulations must be set someone else could come with their cheap version that screws everyone and sets back the regulatory evolution of self driving cars a decade there is such a thing as too soon
116,reason you have to pay attention is the self driving relies on a computer algorithm based on reinforcement learning the more data they can collect the better it will become but they have to collect that data somehow its like the idea of learning algebra if you came from an understanding of basic math learning algebra isnt too hard but if youre trying to jump from elementary school math straight into algebra youre going to be lost right now theyre trying to teach something that has never understood driving to drive so you can think of the people using the software as teachers and the more time they put into learning the better it can be but without them the right at which itll improve will be dramatically slower so in order for this sort of technology to take off and to be safe it requires a lot of training because how can it expect something like a pedestrian jumping into the road or an animal darting across or even another car swerving in front of you these are all very rare situations that may never happen to most people
117,safety critical systems shouldnt be beta tested on the public at all then how should tesla gather training data for their neural network
118,youre going to claim youve not heard of a single auto pilot or fsd death lol pretty wild not to mention teslas own data shows more accidents with auto pilot than not
119,are tesla cars less safe though the only statistics ive seen show that they are times safer than average electrekcotesla autopilot engaged x lower chance accident than average car data when you count how many accidents per aggregate million miles driven does anyone have statistics that show otherwise
120,keep in mind that tesla is heavily reliant on neural networks so even the engineers dont understand exactly how things changed and how they may affect specific situations they know how it behaved in the many simulated situations but reality will always be a bit different tesla needs tons of data from real situations to train the system if you only had people from around tesla factories feed it data the system would become great at driving near those facilities but not necessarily elsewhere this is why such a public training data gathering must be conducted
121,as opposed to what the actuarial tables the rest of our lives are based on im any other business the bankinsurancecompany can assume youre not financially soundunhealthyunfit for anything based on just knowing your age and gender do you really think actual digital driving records of your personal acceleration awareness and accidents is bullshit compared to what actual other data that is used in real life
122,from that article in most tesla vehicles equipped with a version of autopilot to the autopilot features are mostly being used for highway drivingand the same distinction is not being done the average vehicle whichis based on nhtsas overall crash data in the usaccidents are more common on city roads and undivided roads than on the highway so its not a fair comparison
123,early and safe are inherently contradictory when talking about software in order for it to be considered safe it needs to be thoroughly and rigorously tested data collected and analyzed since the only information i have about their process right now is that they themselves consider this software early and they are rolling back this update because it was causing safety issues it was ipso facto not tested thoroughly enough at least giving them the benefit of the doubt that they did not intentionally release unsafe software either way it is very clear that they do not have any data to prove that this software is safer than a human driver
124,i remember seeing this data years ago too specifically they were comparing the data before and after the model s gained the auto pilot features in like or so the accident rate on free ways halfed itself in one year for the model s just from the rollout thats now year old software
125,im sorry but youre parroting the same shady thing tesla did tesla does not tabulate the same metric as the nhsta but instead uses a more severe crash instead of accident to make it appear as if fewer of them happen if ford came out and releases safety data only looking at times the airbag went off i dont think you keep your same opinion you just cant randomly make up apples to oranges comparisons arent safer on autopilot so researchers calling for driver monitoring may be right you also cant compare mostly freeway miles to all miles thats just laughably statistically biased
126,well no not really of the m miles between accidents in manual mode would be on freeway and m off of it for the m miles in autopilot m would be on freeway and just off of it so the manual record is roughly one accident per m miles off freeway and per m miles on freeway but the autopilot record ballparks to m miles between accidents off freeway and m on freeway in other words about longer without an accident in manual with forward collision avoidance on or tacc than in autopilot instead of being safer with autopilot it looks like a tesla is slightly less safe tesla refuses to release the data or confirm on why it insists on using a different crash metric which only filters more severe crashes to make it look like theyve had fewer if it were better why play all these tricks
127,waymo actually has permits and professional drivers they run through the california dmv and report disengagements tesla on the other hand refuse to provide any data to regulators see this article
128,since its unregulated were relying on tesla for that data right is there any third party verification of those numbers
129,from q in the nd quarter we registered one accident for every million miles driven in which drivers had autopilot engaged by comparison nhtsas most recent data shows that in the united states there is an automobile crash every miles to q in the nd quarter we recorded one crash for every million miles driven in which drivers were using autopilot by comparison nhtsas most recent data shows that in the united states there is an automobile crash every miles seems to be making good progress
130,tesla refuses to release the data or confirm on why it insists on using a different crash metric which only filters more severe crashes to make it look like theyve had fewer
131,i believe a dutch company was able to hack not sure if this is the right term and see all the data a tesla sends now if i remember correctly it wasnt something they could do over and over again tesla could fix the hack in one update but it did show us everything the tesla reports so now courts know what to ask for so at least there is something
132,but an accident is different than a crash and youre not using nhts highway data like tesla is youre giving the same biased bullshit
133,im not against evs renewables self driving or climate change actions what i am against is when a company purposefully obfuscates and hides data from a beta program that i am involved in but did not consent to we can aim to improve evs and self driving without gargling elons cock if a company is going to be testing self driving vehicles on public roads then all their test data should be publicly available and they should be able to be held accountable if a fluke in the software ends up killing someone
134,i think the point that a lot of people are making is that tesla self driving is being beta tested on the public in a manner than no one outside the tesla can knowingly consent to as long as the self driving mode is being used on public roads full crash data and statistics should be publicly available with the ability to hold the company accountable when it falls short and their car kills someone
135,unnecessarily antagonistic response to a highlight of data from their linked source but okay would you happen to know where i can find the study they refer to in the forbes article when they say according to research at mit of autopilot use is on limited access highways im having trouble finding it as it isnt linked anywhere or named in full only referenced and all the numbers are derived from that i would absolutely like for tesla to be more open about the numbers and definitions they use but the same goes for the critiques
136,youre guessing what the government would do if they had data that tesla refuses to give up
137,currently us highway deaths account for crashes every week in comparison googles autonomous car has driven over million miles with only one minor incident caused by the artificial intelligence that is not enough numbers without the total number of highway miles driven in the us each week this data is meaningless
138,which until there is extensive long term data proving that navigation systems never go down and are always accurate ie human intervention is extremely rare makes complete sense right now there isnt enough data time or number of vehicles to prove that human intervention would never be necessary these rules would probably be lifted in reverse order over the years as these systems are proven
139,it opens the door to total access and companies dont want to be know for giving your info to the govt cars will not be owned by the govt so theyll have to ask for the info you need to stop spreading the idea that the private sector isnt fully cooperating with the govt to hand over your data a lot of big companies have been outed to have worked with the nsa during the prism program eg microsoft google facebook yahoo and while it has affected their reputation people largely dont change government also is known to have secret ties with plenty of private sector companies that are seemingly innocent so that idea that the govt doesnt have your data is a joke
140,pretty obvious computers are not distracted nor drunk driving isnt an art form its a science and its not a difficult thing to do consider the dumbest people you know can still keep the car on the road of course theres exceptions road conditions road work pedestrians other cars accidents but thats what google has been working on for over a decade via real mileage and simulations the beauty of it is that with one accident we can take the data and train all cars instead of a few surviving participants its painfully obvious computers humans at driving
141,that flawcode is corrected and the update is rolled out so that accident never happens again a programmer will probably tell you that fixing bugs in complex systems is more of an art than a science though im pretty excited at the prospects of unit testing for these kinds of things conceivably the sensor readouts prior to every accident can be perfectly recorded and used as a test data for future updates whereby the software must make the correct decision when faced with the known crash conditions before its allowed to be deployed
142,we didnt evolve to be able to drive we evolved to handle that sort of input and real time analysis however you still seem to be arguing about the relative abilities of cars vs computers which im not talking about im pointing out that its difficult for a computer to drive a car thats why its cutting edge technology with a handful of companies even trying to make it happen you know what isnt difficult for a computer spreadsheets databases that stuff thats so easy foss programmers give it away for free its not at all easy for computers to drive cars and it wont be for many many years even if theyre already better at it than humans its not easy for them and its not easy to improve them if it was easy to improve them when they made a mistake we wouldnt teach them how to avoid the mistake by giving them hundreds of thousands of miles of driving wed say dont turn left in front of oncoming traffic or wed say a flashing left yellow arrow means you can turn if its safe it wouldnt take examples to teach them the difference between a real stop sign and a stop sign on a roadside billboard as part of an advertisement
143,of the m miles between accidents in manual mode would be on freeway and m off of it for the m miles in autopilot m would be on freeway and just off of it so the manual record is roughly one accident per m miles off freeway and per m miles on freeway but the autopilot record ballparks to m miles between accidents off freeway and m on freeway in other words about longer without an accident in manual with forward collision avoidance on or tacc than in autopilot instead of being safer with autopilot it looks like a tesla is slightly less safe tesla refuses to release the data or confirm on why it insists on using a different crash metric which only filters more severe crashes to make it look like theyve had fewer if it were better why play all these tricks
144,are you saying that they dont use the same rules for counting manual and autopilot accidents according to their safety report methodology listed on the bottom of their safety report page methodology we collect the amount of miles traveled by each vehicle with autopilot active or in manual driving based on available data we receive from the fleet and do so without identifying specific vehicles to protect privacy we also receive a crash alert anytime a crash is reported to us from the fleet which may include data about whether autopilot was active at the time of impact to ensure our statistics are conservative we count any crash in which autopilot was deactivated within seconds before impact and we count all crashes in which the incident alert indicated an airbag or other active restraint deployed our crash statistics are not based on sample data sets or estimates in practice this correlates to nearly any crash at about mph kph or above depending on the crash forces generated on the other hand police reported crashes from government databases are notoriously under reported by some estimates as much as in large part because most minor crashes like fender benders are not investigated we also do not differentiate based on the type of crash or fault for example more than of all autopilot crashes occur when the tesla vehicle is rear ended by another vehicle in this way we are confident that the statistics we share unquestionably show the benefits of autopilot there isnt a differentiation between the manual or autopilot methodology in here so its very apples to apples
145,where is the source for the nhsta crash data
146,because you cannot do that without bias tesla does not report the same statistics if you compare them its not apples to apples and tesla will look like less because they have only more serious crashes included if you use biased data youre going to get biased results tesla carefully chose their language and recklessly compared different data arent safer on autopilot so researchers calling for driver monitoring may be right
147,there isnt a better way to compare them nhtsa and tesla source their data differently nhtsa only has police reported data tesla has its car reported metrics the best you can do is teslas own data compared between autopilot and manual which per mile shows its safer to use autopilot if you want to change that result by weighing metrics over whether or not freeway miles count as much as ruralcity miles you are going to need to be rather methodical about it
148,true thats the other option the car manufacturers will absolute write the correct data to the hard drive showing if the driver took over control like they absolutely had their chips take the right anti pollution actions even when no one was looking amazingly turns out its always the drivers fault
149,motor vehicle fatality rate in us by year the table below shows the motor vehicle fatality rate in the united states by year from through for specifically national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa data shows people were killed in motor vehicle crashes an average of per dayin there were an estimated crashes with fatalities killing and injuring about children under die every year in traffic collisions records indicate that there were motor vehicle fatalities in the united states from to pm tokittens_from_space exclude me redditcommessagecompose towikitextbotmessageexcludemesubjectexcludeme exclude from subreddit npredditcomrvirginiaaboutbanned faq information npredditcomrwikitextbotwikiindex source githubcomkittenswolfwikitextbot downvote to remove v
150,if youre really concerned with everyones safety in that hypothetical story networked self driving cars are the best chance of no one getting hurt the cars will detect the child moving toward the street long before a human would and can run through all contingency plans and find the best one in addition the car will already be driving conservatively based on data obscured sides of road in a way that most humans wouldnt i suppose there are rare situations where something changes very suddenly and the laws of physics now dictate that something is going to get hit but even then the car can plan faster than a person could and minimize the damage
151,why does it need to identify that its a person in the google video pedestrians and cyclist are automatically identified in a consumer sdc that will presumably happen at a very low level maybe even silicon for example googles project tango tctechcrunchfileswordpresscomcameras_tangopng wh has x on board computer vision processors that do the heavy lifting and number crunching that data is then exposed to the higher levels my point and the ethical situation is that the ai will probably already know whats in the swerve area since it will probably be identified at a low level a programmer may end up intentionally or unintentionally ignoring what is known to the car
152,swerving almost always makes it worse just watch some dash cam videos see how many would be avoided if one car simply kept going straight and would have missed the other car all together most of these scary situations are irrelevant with sdcs here is why you are still thinking of an sdc a true sdc as being a solitary computer controlling a solitary car like you driving your car this is not how it would work first you can only see one very small thing in your fov at a time you have to move your vision plane around to see anything else so when you see someone walk out in front of you feet in front of you you can not do anything about it you wont even have time to swerve or even release the gas pedal this is an imposible scenario for the sdc the sdc will see you or more feet back it will know you are their and it will be tracking you and get this this is the important bit so will every other sdc in range visually of you so the car coming the other way will also see you the two cars will coordinate with each other share data they will both see you it will weight your existence as a probability and what it think you could do and constantly dozens of not hundreds of times a second re see you re measure you and re predict what it thinks you will do and so will the other car when you move the cars will already be acting before your foot gets inches into the road both cars will automatically begin to act if they can brake they will brake if they must swerve the car that was to hit you will swerve to miss you and coordinate with the other car to also swerve so it does not head on the other sdc this will all happen at cpu cycle speeds so insanely fast it will be like the flash or superman casually walking around at superspeed while the slow beings you move around like molasses slow and easy to predict it really can be that good you would have to get pretty damned creative to trick on sdcs will do what drives like me do but on a whole new level of insane eadd extremely aggressive defensive driving part of this driving is being proactive about possible dangers for example doing everything you can to avoid getting into a situation where you do not have outs available at all times directions you can go to avoid some trouble seeing a possible hey what if this guy does this or that situations and proactively changing your circumstances in advance even if he does nothing so that if he does your position to alter or avoid is improved sdcs will be able to do what i do on such an insane level that it will make what i do look like a squirrel trying to fly a starship
153,waymo is ahead because google wanted to do this over years ago they have had it on their mind as they build all their other stuff so today google has more data of the physical world than anyone else that they can leverage they know when there is an accident with waze they know when there is a traffic jam they can see the traffic light patterns and when the pattern changes they can see the data where there is a stop sign or even a stop sign has been removed waymo is using a database the cars drive from so if the database indicates a stop sign they stop they do not have to see the stop sign but if the database indicates a stop sign and there is non that they see they create an exception that is logged and the situation is looked into but google can also verify what is happening by using the human driver behavior that they get through google maps and google waze they know if a protest closes a road in real time if a parade they even know how busy a store is at a particular time they know when the stores open and close google has built up their data in prepartion for the data for self driving car robot taxi service and having far better utilization than anyone else but not just the data google has the infrastructure to support you need the ability to handle lots of data coming in make sense of it and get events to cars in real time sound familiar ultimately self driving cars is a software engineering problem google attracts the top engineers in the world so they basically get more first round draft choices than anyone once the cream of the crop comes in and is hire they then can take the cream of the crop of the cream of the crop and send them to waymo google created a virtual california that they can inject diffrent situations this is just vital for doing automated testing i have zero clue how gmforduber and the others are doing this i suspect they just are not why i cant see them getting to a safe solution you are making software and model changes you need to be sure that your change is not breaking something else you need to be able to first do virtual testing there is just so many other factors that favor googlewaymo than just being the only ones that have it working without safety drivers google has b in the bank for example with less than b debt they could buy gm and have plenty left over if they wanted to the piece googlewaymo is missing and nobody has is the car durability data today taxi companies buy regular cars they are not optimized for using as a taxi waymo will now collect data like there has never been before on the cars and that data will drive improvement in durability well beyond cars of today that will enable them to drive down the cost of self driving cars robot taxi service to be cheaper than using your own car within years ultimately waymo will use that data to build cars as it will ultimately be a competitive advantage but they should buy cars until they get the data gathered and then they should buy car making expertise and not do it organically then there is an entirely different angles that google has advantageous that nobody is close at having right now of the top apps used on all smart phones are owned by google enwikipediaorgwikilist_of_most_popular_smartphone_apps gm ford honda combined do not have a single one so there is discovery to summon a car google is unmatched in this area no other company close so you type car into search and a car shows up or you add a calendar event and you get a pop up do you need a car you write an email to get dinner with a friend next week and you both get a pop up do you need a car i saw a stat recently that new email accounts today are more than going to gmail they now have over billion active accounts but it is not only on your phone google in the smart speaker space has moved ahead of amazon even thought getting to the market years later move over amazon echo google home now sits upon the smart speaker throne home most popular speaker so you with google you can just be in your house and say car now and a car shows up gmfordhonda do not have smart speakers honestly never understood how any of this could be debated it is not like it is close now i am someone that does not believe people will be buying self driving cars does not make any sense to me that is people thinking the old world i also do not believe level will happen for decades and possibly not in my life time we have no idea how to do it it will not be as safe as level but there is probably not the financial benefits to spend the billions to do level ultimately it comes down to money we have no idea the processing power that would be required to do level it might be we are a long way from having the silicon to support i think it is far more likely level rolled out like you would roll out cell service area by area with the ones that make you the most money first with self driving cars it will also be driven by government regulation you can get to coverage in probably the next years with level you will then connect city to city so you do phoenix and do tuscon and then you do the highways inbetween eventually you are covering most of the us btw the confusion with level is caused by musk he is way smarter than i and knows better he says things that are simply ridiculous then people believe them the one i find most funny is having the hardware to do level we do not have the algorithms to do level so the idea of having the silicon to support is absurd how can you know that if we do not have algorithms
154,to put all this more concisely they are ahead for a couple reasons they started earlier than everyone else by a long margin they have probably the best infrastructure in the world theyve likely spent more money on talent in this space than anyone else they have the largest collection of top quality software engineers in the world at base google not just waymo they can leverage existing servicesdata like google photos to build classifiers
155,we have to remember that theyre still learning how to launch so if the first launch takes million miles and the second only its still an order of magnitude improvement if they improve another ten fold which they will were talking only a few weeks of work i do however wonder how they scrub parked cars from the maps to get driveway and curb data id imagine theres a way to incorporate satellite imagery
156,i thought it was weird how kraftik distanced waymo from google maps in that european interview it seemed odd i know they have different mapping needs but it seems like the data collected for sdcs and for place locations are useful to both teams and theyd want to consolidate efforts
157,google has been interested in doing self driving cars for over a couple of decades since day they have done stuff to help them position for the day page has indicated it started with an experience he had at university in michigan or minnesota one of those cold states that starts with an m the other aspect that is critical with maps and waze is that it brings real time data from humans that can be used and even trained from to a certain extent so if all the humans are stopping somewhere and visually it does not make sense for the waymo car you probably should be stopping and definitely being careful but google can see stops signs that humans blow through they get accidents in real time to avoid that is with waze they get real time traffic events or a parade or a protest basically they have many millions of phones giving them the data of humans moving around in real time but they are the only ones with this data but it is not just the data but the infrastructure being able to stream events from so many phones at the same time and able to make sense and run against models and then use to update is actually really hard to do google has been doing it for over a decade and already knows how and has the technology to leverage gm or ford or whoever struggles to create a decent infotainment system ultimately this data is about safety that is why you see waymo having gone over million miles with a single accident their fault which was a fender bender and nobody hurt it is why i just cant see a gm self driving car ever being as safe as a waymo car we can see that gm is having accidents at a much higher rate and gone a tiny number of miles compared to google the motor cyclist that gm hit did live but think it is just a matter of time until they kill someone think gm has gone k miles and waymo over million but then waymo has done over a billion virtually which is critical to have you must do automated testing and situational injection which i do not believe any of the others can do this will be critical for safety
158,im sure they will cover the same street multiple times and incorporate data they already have
159,i do however wonder how they scrub parked cars from the maps to get driveway and curb data ive wondered this as well there are some places with no street sweeping and where there are cars or rvs parked so no amount of re mapping will solve the issue if you digitally erase cars and rvs from the map whats the point of having such an accurate d map then ive been meaning to write a post about localizationmapping basics and this is one of the questions i wanted to ask maybe ill get around to it soon
160,imagine if you mapped everything in p and then wanted it again in k probably just a new sensor package and they need better data
161,and ingesting and storingcomputing that much data
162,it could have to do with monopoly accusations im not sure whether you can just use data from one company to another but im spitballing here
163,dude you have no clue how much cruise has tested what their disengagement rate is like or how advanced their simulations are the last data released was from november
164,the maps are pretty sensitive to the height of the lasers switch to a new vehicle model and youll probably want to add new data to your maps based on that new data because the new vehicles laser sees things from a different perspective
165,guess because i am weird ha never had anyone say that before cruise went k miles in they do not have virtual world so zero virtual it is not about sucking anyones dick as you say it is just what the facts are how both waymo and gm and everyone but tesla is doing this it is a very manual development and miles driven has a linear relationship to where you are at in development obviously variety also plays a roll waymo far more variety and far more miles and so far ahead it is not complicated i am only talking the self driving tech aspect gm is way way more behind when you include all the other things needed for a commercial robot taxi service they do not have the digital infrastructure to support they do not have the human driving data which means cant make safe google knows what intersections people blow through with their google maps data and waze so can be more careful and avoid an accident where gm does not have that data just one example also why you see gm cars crash so much even with going so few miles
166,i didnt just completely make up the trip cost i based it on tony sebas estimates in atlanta where i am it might cost to go all the way across town which ive only done twice in years because its basically across the state but for most cities anywhere should be in the range its all pure speculation at this point but i think its a reasonable hypothetical to move the discussion forward while i think retail like home depot and grocery stores wont be around in years there is no reason to go too far out on the thought experiment limb i dont see why an sdc wouldnt let you haul groceries but assume you have to have a large item from home depot delivered and it cost you which is what it cost to rent a truck from hd for an hour today would you give up one two or all of your cars i agree government could step in and completely kill everything its why we cant have nice things my main hope here is that they will be so behind the curve that they wont add a lot of tax to it until enough people have switched and they will be politically unable to do so the only data point to give me hope is that all the car manufactures are on board and dont seem to be lobbying that i know of to kill sdcs in the cradle i think in general we look at things like iphones and think wow that is and expensive new thing in my life i previously didnt need but i do now what we dont remember is that this thing increases the productivity of the overall economy by thousands of dollars per device sdcs arent even as abstract of cost benifit as a smart phone could sdcs be more expensive that ride sure but there current costs of transit is so large that its hard to imagine how it couldnt save trillions of dollars per year no matter what happens
167,mdata m e m m sxfbbec xcdabafb m e well i took a shot at finding it in mountain view since thats where they said it was and i think i found it this is the area where it happened those cars going the wrong way were headed north on north shoreline drive my guess is that they drifted into the left turn lane at the crossroads of monticitostierlin and without realizing it crossed the street cleanly over into the other left turn lane and the rest is pretty much history
168,ayhtdata m e m st_xnwolfmm uduhjmw e well they took the wrong lane pretty early
169,i think they were here when they took the wrong lane it was pretty early but i cant conceive of how else they got over the median given that there are trees and a fairly significant curb ayhtdata m e m sbipbkmarjouj_nqa e
170,which in statistical terms is insignificant given the small data set but it makes for the opposite headline that the umtri research has been directing us towards
171,i mean they have driven well over a million miles without any accidents for which they were at fault with the majority of the accidents being rear ended at stop signslights true we dont know how many times an accident was avoided due to intervention by the safety driver but in those situations they analyze the cars data including what the car would have done if left alone they know if the car would have been in a wreck and if so the engineers address the behavior that would have caused it
172,university of michigan transportation research institute they put out a report that suggested higher rate of accidents for google cars however there just isnt enough data to come to that conclusion yet
173,to be fair they do have a higher crash rate just not with statistical certainty and with about a billion qualifiers the report did an ok job explaining the shortcomings of the data the media understandably ignored a lot of that i still blame umtri for email blasting non peer reviewed research to the media
174,people also believed that computers would never beat a human at chess go or dota however these systems learn from real data and given enough examples will learn and eventually be better than humans its just a matter of time and data tesla is taking the correct approach which is to bet on a system that can be trained vision only
175,computers have exceeded humans in text reading for a while now image character recognition is pretty much a solved problem no reason to invent wacky ways to display speed limits just use what is already there they already use maps for this and augment that by reading signs both have to fail to be wrong same could happen with all your methods the real fail was the map data
176,i assure you its not just a matter of time and data thats precisely what one large scale deep learning challenge after another has learned the hard way over the last few years chess and go are combinatorially complex but conceptually dead simple which is why both were essentially solved with large scale search algorithms the latter boosted with reinforcement learning to further constrain the search space these are fundamentally incomparable to a problem like driving
177,however these systems learn from real data and given enough examples will learn and eventually be better than humans what youre suggesting is not factually accurate these systems cannot learn behaviours holistically and on their own at this time they require an incredible amount of guidance and can only learn individual behaviouralperceptual subsets of larger problems
178,thats not true getting ml systems to perform how tesla claims fsd will isnt just a matter of data quantity they also need highly varied data from different sensors which they dont have high quality data they use low res cameras and orders of magnitude more processing power than they have
179,yeah its so weird that people think perception is easily trained with only vision data as opposed to vision data labelled with a point cloud like just think of the trivial example of trying to teach a kid the difference between catsdogs just shoving more pictures of catsdogs at them doesnt help without also telling them if they got it right or not its clear tesla also know this as they have units driving around with a suite of lidar presumably for this exact reason but no where near as many as the av companies do
180,even if the self driving tech failed and the self driving tech is garbage this accidentdeath is still due to human error a self driving system was not responsible for avoiding hitting pedestrians a human was responsible for avoiding hitting pedestrians and they failed to do so this is only more evidence we need to speed up self driving cars one can make an argument that testing an av system still in development with a human responsible for the vehicle is more dangerous than a regular human driven vehicle however data shows the opposite the accident per mile rate of testing avs is a tiny fraction of the human accident per mile rate and even more so when you consider the majority of av testing is in more complex urban environments more complexity less miles
181,i think the problem is when the camera sends the raw footage it was before any sort of exposure adjustments made in the computer software the adjustments are easy to make and probably will be the first step before any further processing is done so basically you are looking at the same image with the same data except if it is processed with a simple global contrast enhancement process it is easier for naked eye but it contains the same amount of data for computers neither one should offer the same feeling as an actual driver because naked eye has its own adaptive exposure settings any programmers of sdc can confirm or refute this i also think if you actually drive through the streets you will see larger objects with more details because the angle of vision is narrower eqiv to a mm lens but the dashcams have much wider lenses
182,youre definitely right about this a human would drive slower for such a condition or possibly see better i am unable to rationalize why these factors are not considered and the video is taken as the evidence for the incidentcalling it a hard to avoid accident if ubers systems were using just this data then definitely theyre at fault if not they should submit all data as evidence and enable analysis of want went wrong
183,the only possibility of this happening is if uber allows this to become a chance for leaning and shares this accident data the way self driving race is on its unlikely that this data will ever see light outside uber
184,there is literally no data in the frames of the uber dash camera video most of the frame is black or so close to black that all you can see are compression artifacts
185,the exposure adjustments are done by the firmware of the camera as part of the raw conversion raw bayer data to mp is not the same thing i mentioned once you receive the mp frame data then you can apply either global or a local contrast enhancement method on the bit data to bring out the details when it is a global method to avoid overexposure in some areas it was sometimes called gamma adjustment we are not sure what the cameras are sending to the computer before or after raw conversion bit or bit just from the released video alone you can still make simple adjusmtents such as gamma correction to make it look brighter to naked eyes but it does not really increase the information amount
186,people have no idea how this works do you know how many software versions and data changes have happened since last october that incident tells you nothing about the current state of the system people that have already decided they dont like it are using that type of thing as a rallying cry
187,regulations regarding when a vehicle is road worthy front white lights yellow trun indicatorswarnings rear red lights horn minimum side mirrors and rear view mirror seatbelts and airbags etc plus clear regulations that arent really followed regarding driving in public roads if you go to any sort of industrial setting vehicles are also fitted yellow strobes on top have mostly designated lanesspaces must be driven by a higher certified driver for the specific vehicle involved and vehicles with lesser visibility require a spotter plus radio comms and supervisors there is also a focus on making streetsinfrastructure safe and predictable all this things combined still make transit related incidents the leading cause of death of youth close to teenagers are killed each year in car crashes nationwide making traffic collisions the leading cause of accidental death among teens ages to according data from the insurance institute for highway safety iihs accidents still leading cause death among teens red flag laws might seem ridiculous from our perspective but the goal of making operating heavy machinery more than ton at high rates of speed kph trough dense urban areas as safe as possible must remain at the heart of when and how we allow vehicles to operate in our communities
