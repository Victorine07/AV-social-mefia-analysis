0,unfortunately i think its precisely consumption that will drive this but not at the end user cars in cities level those in the short term will be play things for the people who pay at the upper end of the purchasing spectrum instead i expect the self driving will likely be introduced more mainstream in the shipping industry trucking to drive down supply chain costs and will focus on first mile ports factories plants where the infrastructure can be more controlled to produce less variance for self driving vehicles to deal with its a simpler problem to program around controlled environments then long haul over interstates at least in the us that tend to be more static and predictable this would let them eliminate trucking jobs and avoid the downtime required by humans even if they dropped the max speed theyll probably save on time by allowing them to keep on truckin through the night cities pedestrians passenger commuters and last mile delivery will be the hardest to tackle disclaimer ive been working in a software field tangentially related to this topic which has afforded me the chance to sit in a few conferences on the subject so the above is not really just my prediction but rather what im regurgitating
1,i think its control the ultimate planned obsolescence product an electric self driving car a simple software glitch or update and the battery life falls off want to fix it it only costs the cost of a new car just buy a new car uncle sam loves it because he can finally tell you when you travel and when you dont uh oh you took part in a unapproved anti government protest freedom credits your car no longer functions i have yet to see a single smart bit of technology that actually worked for the person its always control consumption is control technology is not being used to free us its going to enslave us its always a product a service something you dont control on a related note somewhat the more i read into the quality of renewable fuels like ethanol and biodiesel the more oil seems like the biggest scam i have ever seen rockefeller backed temperance movements with millions to wipe out the ethanol industry his biggest competition the modern car is a money sink and it doesnt need to be designed to fall apart and get you to buy another i just want a simple repairable motor vehicle that i can run on homemade ethanol something i can fix it doesnt even need to be fast if i could i would go mph tops
2,what happens if they gain sentience and decide to kill their driver even if that wasnt possible i still wouldnt be comfortable not controlling the vehicle
3,in the future sure why not when is that exactly do i get to decide
4,freedom inherently comes with risks some safety measures should just be encouraged not enforced i mean it would technically be in the publics best interest to stay home all day and never interact with strangers but a free society is always going to be vulnerable to dangers and the effects of bad decision making
5,no i like being able to see something cool and just decide to turn off the main road cant really do that when google maps is the driver and navigator
6,vehicle to vehicle vv and vehicle to whatever vx communications are in limited use in demonstration regions as well as within manufacturer eg some cadillac models can communicate with each other as well as in principle anything else supporting dedicated short range communication dsrc but wide deployment is still years away nhtsa actually proposed a rule requiring light vehicles personal cars trucks etc to support vv communication in but the effort has stalled in no small part because the fcc decided to reallocate most of the part of the em spectrum previously dedicated to vv communications to unlicensed use
7,what happens when someone intent on malicious behavior decides to actively jam the entire range it seems that with so much focus on making the technology work not a lot of focus is placed on making it so people cant easily interfere with it in decidedly evil ways
8,im a self taught software engineer however i have never experimented with ai or machine learning im curious as to why are people so afraid once ai gets intelligent enough they will be able to control us i mean wont the ai be just another program on the computer how could the ai manipulate its own code much less escalate its own privileges and expand on the internet
9,thank you all for your questions it was a fun hours i took my time to answer the initial questions and rushed through the ones i answered in the end apologies for that i hope you find the book a humans guide to machine intelligence of interest as you seek to learn more about ai algorithmic decision making
10,im might be too late but hopefully you might still see this im a software engineer but im self taught regarding ai basics and built some stuff with tensorflow from what ive seen the industry is dead set on machine learning and its subsets like deep learning are there other methods of ai that exist outside of machine learning that has potential
11,so the way algorithms were written previously was the programmer had to explicitly specify a set of rules the systems should follow what a program should do if faced with a certain condition these rule based systems worked reasonably well but if the software came across a situation that the programmer had not accounted for the software fils whats happening now is that ai is able to learn on its own from past data further it can continue to learn and better itself when faced with new situations just like humans without the need of explicit intervention from the programmer this is the domain of machine learning a subfield of ai consider an example of building a system to diagnose diseases the old approach also called expert systems approach would require interviewing doctors and going through many medical books to come with explicit rules that predict the disease given the symptoms the new way with machine learning is to look at historical data of patients their symptoms and the diagnosis made by doctors for them it will on its own learn those symptoms that predict a persons disease from the data the learning approach is proving to be far more effective than the older approach
12,they share the same set of rules they can even predict how other cars will behave this is most important part right now our ability to coordinate with other drivers without being able to communicate is based on humans understanding and following traffic protocols i dont know exact numbers but i would suspect that upwards of of all traffic accidents are a result of humans failing to properly follow these protocols passing on the right going too fast following too closely etc at issue is that humans are greedy buggers who are only concerned with personal short term consequences so these protocols are often treated more like suggestions people generally dont care that rapidly changing lanes without signalling reduces the total throughput of the highway by x just that they are late to their dentist appointment imagine if airline pilots or train conductors thought the same way once we eliminate human drivers from the road entirely lots of these issues just go away a computer will never decide that it is ok to drive slowly in the left lane or roll through a stop sign it will follow the protocols put into place exactly as they were intended to be followed and traffic fatalities could drop into the hundred or dozens
13,encryption is always an option they already have this kind of stuff for your remote for your car to unlock the door its encrypted in some way im not an expert in that but i do know there have been some security issues with thieves being able to transmit the signal to open your car and it opens no alarms no nothing to answer your question theres nothing stopping people from sending false signals but whether or not the car interprets them as real and reacts to them is a different story imagine a hacker were to be driving down the road and decide to recant the rock falling whats stopping him from saying theres a rock infront of me everyone behind me stop immediately they take that instruction as truth and act accordingly the car systems have to be built with security that isnt really feasible yet you have to protect the communications easy we do this all the time and the communications encryption method you also have to protect the hardware in from way from being tampered with in a way that could send false signals its very complicated and wont be an easy hurdle to overcome
14,a related favourite remark from schlock mercenary http while it may seem harsh that the st century equivalent of driving under the influence carries with it the death penalty this is due to an inherent inequivalency between moui manual operation under the influence and dui with dui you need only climb into your vehicle while under the influence of alchohol or drugs and attempt to drive it home with moui you must disable a number of safety systems designed to prevent idiots like you from manually operating their vehicles while inebriated after disabling the safety systems which task almost certainly requires ice cold sobriety you must decide to switch the vehicle to a manual mode of operation in some cases this requires installing a manual mode of operation
15,so they definitly need crossings only for humans who actually are using their body to move xb but to get some counter to the anti self driving cars here even if that looks scary as hell history has shown that computers make better and faster decisions then humans a software would indentify a risky situation and will drive slower humans often times would even create risky situation just to be sec earlier at the red light im a cyclist and cry every time when a car overtakes me mid corner so hate the car infrastructure itself not blindly a computer bcs it looks scary
16,its possible to do this right now without software and with pedestrians
17,im no fan of cars but i do think well be safer with software in control rather than selfish distracted morons
18,this was peak dumbass when people started believing this shit was possible ok so your plan is to replace cars and service vehicles with tech that remotely doesnt exist mind you despite your highway auto features you think are even close this level and make sure they can all reliable communicate with each other and a new grid and all software companies will play fair and every car owner will keep up maintenance to for community integrity and thats just to start i have an idea for an electric vehicle that can use less space carry way more people and still get you where you want to go safer and more efficiently than this dystopia you imagine choo choo choo mother fuckers choo choo choo
19,itt people who understand you can program a car to avoid a car but not a pedestrian im against cars as much as the average person but every time this sub pops up on my feed i see criticisms that well frankly fucking weak could a software bug cause a death absolutely thats a risk with all travel you could fall of a bike and break your neck or get a concussion absolutely
20,it doesnt even take a software bug one thing wrong with the road and it all grinds to a halt one patch of black ice that causes an unexpected brake one pothole the algorithm doesnt expect one emergency vehicle coming through the intersection that the algorithm doesnt know how to schedule around one deer darting out into the road one piece of debris one tire bursting etc etc etc theres so many spanners that could get thrown into those works and all it takes is one for the entire thing to turn into a massive pileup if we were going to automate everything into a giant public transit system there are way more efficient and safe solutions than one car per commuter a comprehensive rail network with an automated last mile system for instance you ride the train to the station nearest your destination then you get on a self driving short range rickshaw kind of thing for the last mile connection provided you dont just walk there were so obsessed with future that were creating problems that we dont need to solve all so we can pretend the needlessly complicated solution is the better one because future
21,no one will be late or early again theyll always be on time the time the government decides for you
22,dont care if cars are bad for the environment dont care if theyre bad for efficiency i like being able to decide where i want to go and go there immediately and ill fight my right to do that no matter what
23,lets use a bit of common sense people this is just a software or animation demonstration even with perfect self driving globally communicating cars a stop and go intersection of two twelve lane highways does not make sense this is not meant to illustrate a practical application of self driving cars
24,i hate to say it but there are a lot of ways we are already one software bug away from death
25,i totally agree with rfuckcars i am a biker but this right here stupid software bug away from death this will have a lot less maybe zero people killed than the drinking idiots out on the road right at this moment so no i do not agree
26,your already software big from death imagine if software bug and your heater sparks a fire
27,weve created an invisible roundabout thats capable of ceasing to exist if even one single car has a software glitch
28,well if theyre self driving you just walk across the cars will stop or more likely a bridge and the title one software bug causing an accident is less likely than a regular idiot driver causing an accident
29,the software bug could be whittled down until its less likely than someone just making a dumb mistake though
30,one software bug from death you say but how many human software bugs running independently of each other are there at any given moment between looking at the phone radio gps coffee or tea etc
31,wow cool what could go wrong and kill a bunch of people cell tower outage power outage lane striping fades road construction someone drives their own car snow flurry falling leaves flat tire person walks or bikes software gets out of date or hacked squirrel chews on a gadget bird poops on a sensor
32,yet we have millions of software bugs humans driving every day no good answers with cars besides making the roads accessable to all did everyone notice in that tweet thread that elon admitted to traffic going up immensely when ai takes the wheel this day was coming all auto makers are spending billions to develop this tech and if you had recognized the trend in auto safety systems ai is just the next logical step to vehicle safety my hope is that more people will value being outside of the car and get enough support to make our public roads equitable to all users this will be independent of whatever cars are doing because the safety standards will be looked at outside of the driver seat and at the most vulnerable peds bikes kids playing unfortunately ill be dead before i see meaningful change in this maybe my kids will enjoy it though
33,your complaint lacks substance while i personally would not want to rely on self driving cars the fact of the matter is that they are hundreds of times safer than any human driver while a software bug causing a pedestrian death is in theory possible this is substantially less likely than a careless driver doing the same
34,hey ive work in automation for a long time and the solution would be very simple push a button that will activate a series of software logic events to alert cars in a certain radius a human is walking across the intersection the way i would do it is all algorithms that predict the vehicle is going to intersect or potentially intersect a human will be put into a safety mode basically slows the car down a lot emphasizes the camera systems to verify path isnt blocked and overall put each vehicle in a certain vicinity on a high alert for potential human injury once the systems for the cross walk verify all humans are across and the pathway is safe it will eliminate the high alert program and fall back into its routine by the time this is a thing all cars in a square mile radius will communicate will all other vehicles they will constantly be sharing vehicle speeds locations destinations future predicted routes and all kinds of things with every car around them and an extremely strong computer quantum computer possibly will make corrections to the flow of traffic accordingly we have many years before we eliminate stop lights and order traffic rules but when it happens its going to be super cool plus robots are x more reliable than a human could ever imagine
35,you need the self walking software update
36,since we have no clue how cognition ie the abilty to think and reason works in a biological brain we have no ability to create machines that have that ability either deep learning algorithms and neural network software do not and cannot have this ability regardless of how much training data you throw at it a child knows the difference between a real stop sign and a stop sign on someones clothing they also know that a stop sign is still a stop sign even if it has a sticker or some graffitti on it these so called improperly named ais do not know the difference furthermore any so called self driving car that has to randomly pull over to the side of the road and stop then call a remote human operator to guide it manually through whatever it is it cant handle is not in any way shape or form ready to be responsible for the safety of human occupants or be allowed on public roads its all a failed technology that will never be ready for real world use these companies all know this but have invested so much money in the development that they insist on marketing it anyway to recover that money or go bankrupt dont fall for the self driving car meme
37,truthfully whats worse being one software bug away from being killed or being killed by a human whos probably texting their bff about some useless drama they created in the first place
38,yeah this only works with every single car running the same software with zero human operators it would never work in real world situations
39,if every single person decided to use one
40,if youve ever flown youre software bug away from death also cross as normal except now you have an algorithm that reacts to your pushing the cross button at the crosswalk and pauses the merge sequence halting all traffic so you can cross safely then resumes like what the fuck i hate tech bullshittery when i see it but for ffs these are easy fixes and implements yall are worse than rthathappened
41,your already one software bug away from death at a traffic light whats the purpose of this post
42,build a train if we built more trains that wouldnt get rid of cars because they both have their own uses we already have roads so we might as well use them potholes youre right we would need a well maintained road for this to work crosswalk they could still exist similar to how these cars communicate with each other a crosswalk button could communicate with the cars software bug car crashes over million car crashes happen in the us per year from human error should we not allow humans to drive
43,today in the news a software glitch caused a car pile up on the i only deaths were recorded as engineers at the manufacturer pointed out this is only the second accident this month bringing the total of deaths to which is still far below the average of gas cars before they were phased out also in the news year olds can they help with the labor shortages
44,to be fair most of the time you are likely one bad software bug from death at most points of your entire life at this point a lot of people have no idea how much software controls things at this point thats why redundancies are built and software engineers get paid so much
45,people will be able to pay for a software upgrade that gives them right of way its coming im all for self driving cars but we need to move to more pedestrian friendly cities and regulate the self driving cars hard
46,i mean i do trust software more than humans to drive death machines if thats the only choice i have humans are unpredictable slow dumb and inattentive
47,one software bug away from death you act like humans arent one sneeze away from swerving across lanes of on coming traffic
48,not just a software bug if any of these cars experience some hardware failure so they have to stop they all fucking crash
49,fromsoftware frogger dlc
50,you could always build a bridge or tunnel for pedestrians which is much better than a crossing anyway however as a software engineer the idea of getting in a car thats on that road is terrifying no way is that safe or could ever be safe vv for this kind of thing would be nightmarish to try and engineer even on paper let alone the real world
51,this would suck and all but the software would be more reliable than humans
52,or a mountain lionother wildlife they get hit by cars all the time im a driver these make me nervous call me crazy but i trust human decision making more than computers
53,the title is a little misleading because honestly for every software bug a self driving car has at least x of humans would of crashed on their own
54,real talk the software is supposed to allow for pedestrians to cross at any given juncture every car in your path will stop immediately foot away no matter how you cross but come on lets be real here
55,more so your brain on silicon valley techbro culture i work in tech im so sick of naive young developers that dont understand you cant solve everything with more software or that just because they understand software doesnt mean they know shit about other domains or that you know how to evaluate externalities the entire self driving car idea is a prime example of this truly self driving vehicles that work with no fallback on unmodified roads is unlikely to be approved anytime soon for good reason the edge cases are a way harder problem than the tech sector will admit and while some safety features driven by that tech are legitimately good ideas eg auto braking too much incomplete automation risks dangerous complacency by human drivers that are already overly distracted as it is particularly since it will fail in precisely the worst case scenarios
56,software is written by humans and the more mass market the software the higher the incentives to cut corners and ship bad code
57,a software program cannot or doesnt weigh in human life in their decision there should be a difference in reaction whether a ball or child jumps in front when there is not a safe stopping distance ultimately its going to be the drivers decision at least in days pass this is why ai fighter copilots would not release munitions ultimately its a human decision to release munitions i believe today its still true a human initiates the wireless drones to release munitions
58,on the contrary the more mass market the software a the bigger the threat from lawsuits and b the more data they have to work with when you get in a self driving car you arent getting a driver with years experience youre getting a driver with years experience split across each vehicle in the fleet xb made up numbers you get the idea
59,which in my experience in spite of being safer and decreasing the risk of accidents and traffic jams rarely ever happens if the rules of the road were followed to a t instead of having of drivers thinking theyre better than most drivers and being ok disobeying the rules because theyre familiarity with a car outruled their sense of dangerresponsibility instead of having selfish drivers who arbitrarily decide to get ahead of everyone else despite no inherent need for it instead of everyone creating barely an inch gap between cars or taking advantage of those with enough space by forcing yourself in there the road would be much safer and more efficient which is why trains rule
60,no thats exponentially more difficult self driving cars work by using a camera system that identifies traffic lanes speed limits and obstacles for that car having system that does all that while calculating a perfect route for every car so that they never have to stop during their whole trip i mean i doubt its even mathematically possible to do so even theoretically let alone in practice where the passengers could suddenly decide to change their destination on a whim
61,yep here in queens last year maro andrianou nycstreetsblogorgqueens da declines to prosecute driver who killed delivery man was feeling impatient and decided to gun it on a residential street using the bike lane as a passing lane killing xing long lin and plowing straight into an outdoor dining structure wherein a diner was injured she tells some preposterous tale for which there is zero evidence and in fact a fair bit of evidence refuting and the da melinda katz lets her walk away with zero punishment whatsoever not even failure to exercise due care
62,i mean i dunno about the heavier vehicles being more deadly thing like no matter how heavy a car is if it hits you youre either crippled for the rest of your life or die the weight of the car in this case only decides whether you are crippled or killed and i honestly dont know which one is worse
63,public transport needs to be built up and funded better cycle lanes should be given some priority rather than just painting a line on the gutter and calling it a day roads in inner cities should be narrowed and there should be dedicated bustran lanes and single family zoning should be abolished to allow for much more productive less sprawling and more pleasant mixed areas there are a great many solutions but in so many places the people who get to decide how to allocate funding see every problem as being solved by building a new highway or broadening existing roads
64,nothing is recyclable really we are too focused on recycling there is nothing wrong in principle with landfilling things especially plastic properly disposed of in a landfill it will sit mostly inert and not cause any serious problems yes there could be some sort of natural disaster that releases it but a natural disaster could also release untapped oil resources if we decided to leave it in the ground really processing oil into plastic etc makes it less toxic in a sense im not arguing we should process all the oil in the world just saying that garbage is overrated as an environmental problem its important that we keep the carbon cycle good and we avoid releasing free toxins into the atmosphere water etc we should use whatever technology best does that and its clear that batteries are better than petroleum as a rule
65,eh want to get really in the weeds of it it is ai ai can even just be if statements ai is an incredibly general term that includes basically any computer decision making ml is a subset of ai and not all self driving algos are neural networks source masters in comp sci and a lot of talk with aiml folk
66,yes and thats not the problem the problem is that if you one day decide you want to just walk instead youll probably get run over
67,yeah no fuck you not being signed up to your ethical agenda is not anti science not being vegan doesnt make you anti science and i havent claimed that it does denying those things apply to animal products is though because science tellsshows us that they do apply by anywhere near million deaths a year no so point does not apply since you mentioned the who their website says the number might be so deaths only matter if they are exactly million you also have to look at indirect deaths through heart disease etc which consuming animal products increases the likelihoodrisk of plus ptsdsuicide of slaughterhouse workers etc climate change is point your claim here is actually about air pollution from arable farming as far as i can tell however that is a fair point that i hadnt considered and is another issue with intensive meat production that requires large amounts of cropland to support it id say that the answer there is more responsible arable farming to grow those crops though you cant do it responsibly on a large scale when using such an inefficient food source animal products though even if you do it as best as possible for animal products you are still growing multiple times the number of crops you would need to if you didnt consume animal products its still a big impact people arent spending of their income on meat your second im not reading one from vegan food and living thats clearly going to be biased link also says could be cheaper but the main difference here is that there is no meat dependency that is forcing people into that choice they are choosing to spend that extra money because they like eating that food but that doesnt matter maybe i worded it weirdly or you are misunderstanding it doesnt matter if the figures are exactly the same the arguments the reasoning is the same apologies if i caused the confusion i was trying to say that the arguments are the same i wouldnt say its meat dependency in the same way as cars but up until a few years ago that would be considered the case veganism is becoming increasingly easy something it seems like people in this sub wants for cars just because veganism is further along doesnt mean it isnt comparable i assume you wouldnt abandon your principles regarding cars if other modes of transport become easier and also the link uses a study its not just the opinion when directly compared it is cheaper than the cheapest meat but it can be a similar price if someone goes expensive on the vegan products meat is not cheaper than the cheapest plants even calorie for calorie or protein to protein and what proportion of that is from intensive farming you didnt even contest the point i made there intensive farming makes up the vast majority of animal products it has to with the amount of people in the world if you are against intensive farming but for the consumption of animal products then you either think that only some people should be allowed them or everyone has to be limited to like portion a week veganism is analogous to some ridiculous ban all cars immediately and you shouldnt use asphalt roads because theyre car products position its not at all veganism is against animal abuse stopping consuming animal products only because of the environment would be your example not veganism edit and now look youve dragged me into a stupid argument about this unrelated issue im going to stop replying under this post now i stated a fact and asked a question about this sub which you decided to respond to by denying science dont see how i dragged you into it
68,if you read the parent post its obvious that cars are not good they cause a lot of environmental damage they disrupt communities and they have negative effects on peoples health both mental and physical in the s america and much of the world decided to redefine how cities were built and started prioritizing car use this led to the destruction of many cities urban cores and a stratification of society that still exists today in fact in the us at least a lot of wealthy black neighborhoods were destroyed to make way for the interstate highway system this also followed a systematic defunding of public transit that crippled low income peoples abilities to get around whether that was orchestrated by the auto industry or just poor planning by cities is up for debate this destruction of urban centers to build parking lots not an exaggeration followed by building up a lot of low density housing has in many ways exacerbated the housing crisis in addition to leaving cities with poor finances to stay solvent often resulting in federal aid to do basic maintenance many young americans whom i assume are the majority of members of this sub grew up in the suburbs and remember feeling isolated and alone because they couldnt leave their homes without a parent driving them somewhere and their friends often lived far away this has stoked a renewed interest in urbanism and rebuilding cities in a way that deprioritizes cars and allows for medium density housing public transit and cyclepedestrian infrastructure so that communities can be safer healthier and more financially solvent thanks for reading my ted talk
69,i didnt make the subreddit and decide what its about
70,it wont work for international travel doesnt take into account innovation in the aerospace industry and assumes that people will be able to afford personal travel options over mass transit i think a more disruptive influence will be just not travelling why would i commute to work if i can vr into the office in fact why would i even be employed if auto translation software could allow anyone from any country to work seamlessly for any company id rarely physically visit a remote office the concept falls apart as soon as you realise that anything we currently do in physical regional hubs works just as well if those hubs are virtual so the nature of travel changes if you want to visit your relatives in scotland you travel there on any day you want and return on any day you want you can work there just as easily so theres no rush to get back holidays would be different try this a driverless car arrives at my home at am to take me to the airport in the car it checks my security checks me onto the flight and drives me directly to the departure lounge arriving minutes before boarding there are more flights now as all the planes are electric theres little environmental impact and no noise the planes are also driverless so can take off at intervals of seconds or less at the other end i leave the plane and step into another driverless car which knows where i want to go this is still a slightly expensive option so replace the cars with driverless buses route optimised to collect me from my home or cheaper still a collection point my driverless uber can take me to it takes a bit longer as we pick up other passengers but much much cheaper
71,already made me decide to drive from md to upper peninsula mi in my tesla have to do flights otherwise not self driving yet but the amount of stress relief alone with autopilot for me and the cost savings its worth it
72,i cant believe none of the top comments have discussed the number of people moving by plane vs how many vehicles would be on the road if driverless cars were in enough quantity to actually disrupt the airline industry million people per day are currently flying domestically million total if you include international and at most domestically those are about hour trips coast to coast or far shorter on average my guess is average flight in the us is about hours but i lack official data so each person is traveling hours to their destination per their day of travel hours on a flight will be conservatively at mph roughly miles very low estimate this hours via car would be hours of driving non stop but of course we need to stop for gaselectric charge or for bathrooms and food i figure a hour mile trip by car at mph average would be closer to hours the low average capacity of commercial flights is people can travel miles in hours using airlines million people can travel miles in hours per day so lets say half the current people flying decide to start traveling via driverless vehicles person can drive miles in hours people can drive miles in hours people can drive miles in hours per day xb now imagine traffic is increase by people increasing main freewayinterstate travel congestion by over million hours per day spread out across the states i cant fathom this ever making a dent in airline travel because enough people realistically switched to driverless cars on average wed see significant increase in travel times traffic congestion etc lastly why is nobody comparing airline flight environmental impact and driverless cars environmental impact plane going hours vs vehicles going hours
73,my so went to california for job training months ago and because i just finished my junior year of collegewasnt working at the time i came with however the company of course only payed for his plane ticket and we wanted to have a car there anyway so i decided to drive the hours there i got to the airport in la before he landed
74,i work with autonomous cars they are incredibly smart and have great perception these cars arent something that can be just done as a startup you have to have the best technology both in software and hardware the point of all of this is make it safe remove the human error these cars dont fall asleep get drunk or become reckless you need the money and time to invest in these cars and the technology its peoples lives at risk so its dangerous to try to join the bandwagon and throw cars out on the road edit phrasing
75,we suck at probability there are dozens of examples of simple puzzles that virtually everyone gets wrong when based on odds this lady was killed crossing dark street wearing all dark colors jaywalking in the worst spot and she stepped in front of a moving automobile so she died but at what point do just decide not to blame the machine
76,self driving cars as a concept are great but not everyone is capable of the engineering required to make a safe autonomous vehicle i would trust google x or tesla to make a good self driving car because they have the experience and talent in systems electrical software and mechanical engineering to pull of such a complicated project but uber is not on their level uber is not really a technology company theyre an appservice provider the uber app could be made by any year old app developer its not complicated so why is uber in the same conversation as companies that have been at the cutting edge of ai for the past decades
77,all cars should come equipped with auto driving and an option to go full manual which could be eliminated via software updates we start driving manually if too concerned about auto mode eventually most everyone will try the auto mode to see how it feels gradually gaining familiarity and comfort with the process at some point it is the most common mode used and stats will show nearly all accidents end up being while in manual mode govt make a decision and all new software updates disable manual except for instances where there are no clearly defined roadsgpsetc i just dont see the arizona death as being a big hurdle i am saddened by the loss of life but going full auto is the only way to stop the current k deathsyear we see now
78,it doesnt matter self driving cars wont catch on and heres why when a human being kills someone else with a car its easy for the rest of us to wrap our heads around someone did something wrong and someone else died theres a reason theres someone to blame we can assign that blame assess our penalties and move on with our lives when a self driving car kills someonewho do we blame whose fault is it who do we punish who do we fine who do we arrest whose license do we take away the software engineer good luck finding a software engineer willing to take on that kind of liability when something goes wrong we need a reason we need someone to punish we need someone to blame self driving cars take that away even if software errors cause a few hundred deaths a year versus the thousands caused by human error i predict society will choose human error because there is nothing to do when a program kills someone except change the program and assure everyone it wont happen again assurances from a software engineer are not something people are liable to accept
79,as an it guy working for the us air force im very concerned about how accessible the computer technology in self driving cars will be one bad update can completely wreck a network i am seriously concerned that self driving cars will present terrorists who can hack with a highly accessible weapon of mass destruction if im ignorant of how these cars are being programmed to prevent intrusion please inform me until i can see proof that im wrong i will continue to believe there is no such thing as safe software
80,lets exclude for a second the test case where a manual driving death occurs due to something out of their control assuming self driving is enforced by law in the future why is it okay to make this tradeoff s vs s for a driver that does not make mistakes while driving but dies due to a fault in software in a self driving car
81,this claim of kill hundreds save thousands assumes that there does not come into being new causes for road accidents caused by self driving cars ie solve some human error problems introduced other ai issues at some point in time there is going to be a crash between two self driving vehicles this would be the first case of a new class of accidents not involving human error but ai error the assumption that the fatalities here would be less than existing is for me unproved if every car on the road was ai driven sure generally i would expect it to be a metastable system with fewer accidentsany thing new on the road for the ai could potentially create a rash of accidentsthis could be a software update to another ai weather conditionsa hardware flaw that went undetected
82,i seem to be alone in thinking there is a difference between we are making the world safer and its okay to release the software early and kill a few people because in the long run it will save lives uber is rushing out self driving cars so they can not pay drivers and increase profits volvo meanwhile had developed a system also for profit that would detect obstructions and stop the vehicle before a human could even start to respond it would have avoided killing the woman possibly stopping completely in tempe and it was in the volvo xc uber was using as a test vehicle uber disabled the system to beta test their own this is the problem given the low quality dashcam footage released there was about seconds from first observing the pedestrian to impact and at mph thats about feet the volvo xc can stop from mph in feet car volvo xc and from in feet http
83,im not in the business of self driving cars dont know much about it at all but i have worked with robotics and id be inclined to say that a lot of litigation will come about if companies decide not to pay out to the best known algorithms written which are known to be more robust in robotics you have tolerances of the machines the higher the tolerance the higher the cost sometimes double the cost sometimes a customer doesnt want to pay that much for the machine so you have to try to solve the problem via algorithm ive written algorithms that have to contend with a lot of noise to signal ratio extra latency bigger epsilons or slop so that the algorithm didnt trip over shitty input in short more can go wrong the cheaper you try to build something tldr there will be a lot of people blaming cheaply made self driving cars for wrongful deaths
84,im hesitant about driverless cars mostly because i worry about the day some future terrorist or corrupt government decides to hack into the system and kill everyone on the road
85,at least with a tesla a fix could come over the air existing dealership rules for the rest mean you have to go into the dealer to update the software so having a fleet shutdown could likely be something not fixed very fast
86,im assuming when the government decides to make autonomous vehicles fully street legal everywhere there will also be some very strict requirements that will need to be met by the manufacturers if the car isnt certified it doesnt drive period
87,so far tesla is setting the standard by taking responsibility if their own car is at fault for the accident but it must be the autopilot driving and the car must be at fault so not you hitting the gas thinking its the brake or someone rear ending your car because they thought it should speed up on yellow and not prepare to stop for red but if the car decides to change lanes into a semi tesla takes responsibility all three scenarios have happened to tesla
88,assuming software always works the way its supposed to
89,if it was a manufacturing fault or a software fault its the manufacturers fault otherwise its likely on you
90,hello tesla called theyre wondering how often their mostly software based vehicles malfunctioned and killed people also ford called and asked if their steering wheels are still attatched the to the car
91,id like to see statistics on assault rifles saving people vs deaths is this like an easter bunny type saving people are we counting each hypothetical situation where a would be intruder decided against robbing you
92,you decide where your driving big brother already knows where youre driving anyway
93,if i saw this situation this is how i would react me sees people about to be run over i switch tracks so the trolley is diverted then i see that person is on the other track i switch it back because killing people that decided to take a nap on train tracks is better for huma ity than killing just
94,not only that as an engineer ive seen some unbelievably terrible code im more than a little nervous about this becoming mainstream and some subpar developer who heard engineering pays well and knew a guy at a car company decides his code is good enough and pushes it to meet his teams arbitrary deadline and ends up causing hundreds or thousands of accidents
95,i know im going to get down voted to shit for this but youre the driver its your job to be paying attention and looking for cyclists and pedestrians not everyone is lucky enough to have a car or can afford to drive everywhere and those that decide to take an alternate transportation method shouldnt have to constantly fear death last year almost pedestrians were killed on texas roads alone thats ridiculous im sorry but i cant see you isnt a fucking excuse
96,evidently you have never seen a cascading failure of engineering design also moving from cars dont kill peoplepeople kill people to cars kill people is a slippery slope and essentially requires providing a new level of corporate responsibility non responsibility is there really going to be a way to check that the car caused fatality isnt deliberate or due to undisclosed software hardware bugs like a volkswagen emissions scandal for self driving cars
97,in many situations safe drive requires violating the traffic code like when you have to cross a double line to get around a parked truck or when you have to exceed the speed limit to safely pass other drivers will constantly break the law too and the cars ai will have to know how to anticipate and navigate that like when you see an asshole speeding driver coming up behind you so you get out of the way to let them pass if the car decides to stick to its lane and speed without regard to the assholes behavior it could create a hazard the car should be required to be reasonably safe just following traffic laws is too low a bar
98,there is little reason cars should not be in communication with each other like an ad hoc mesh atc network we just need to reach critical mass of ai driven cars the cars who are linked can share data about pedestrians road hazards and non controlled vehicles on the road the software to accomplish that is straightforward but nontrivial to implement even standard driver controlled vehicles could contribute camera data and benefit from a digital model of the road ahead for example to see hazards over the hill or around the curve ahead through a hud system
99,true heck at least if its software related and i die from it it might get fixed how long have we still been having dui related deaths after all this damn time
100,theres literally no argument humans driving cars had caused hundreds and thousands more deaths than self driving cars ever will regardless of ethics in ai decision making
101,self driving cars will really completely change how we deal with car insurance what might end up happening is people buy insurance for their autonomous car and if an accident does happen insurance pays for it and life goes on nobody is charged more since the risk of that particular car getting into another accident is not increased it stayed the same relative to every other autonomous car on the road that particular cars risk of getting into another accident has not changed since every car would ideally have the same programming were still thinking of insurance in terms of who to blame in an accident but when autonomous cars come around they arent going to be making the same mistakes as human drivers if an accident does happen its almost of the time going to be due to something out of the control of any one car the simplest way to handle insuring a vehicle that simply cannot have at fault accidents is just to pay a flat rate and when an accident does happen insurance pays for the damages for that particular car and moves on if there were multiple vehicles involved each vehicles insurance will pay for the damage on their particular vehicle now if an accident does happen that is at the fault of the cars programming that should be up to the software developer to deal with if a glitch in the cars programming causes the accident that developer is responsible for their own software if an accident occurred due to a poorly maintained vehicle that is the responsibility of the vehicles owner to deal with in that case their insurance provider could decide to raise their premiums because they have proven that they dont maintain their vehicle or they could require regular inspections or something like that

103,if the car decides to stick to its lane and speed without regard to the assholes behavior it could create a hazard luckily sticking to the righthand lane when driving slower or not passing is written into the traffic code in most places for specifically this reason so this situation wouldnt happen in the first place
104,from the linked wikipedia page problems analogous to the trolley problem arise in the design of autonomous cars in situations where the cars software is forced during a potential crash scenario to choose between multiple courses of action sometimes including options which include the death of the cars occupants all of which may cause harm a platform called moral machine was created by mit media lab to allow the public to express their opinions on what decisions autonomous vehicles should make in scenarios that use the trolley problem paradigm other approaches make use of virtual reality to assess human behavior in experimental settings in the government of germany constituted an ethical commission that addressed the implications of autonomous driving as a result the commission defined rules for autonomous and connected driving which will be obligatory for upcoming laws regarding the production of autonomous cars
105,i wouldnt be surprised if insurance companies tried to pull some stunt like that however acts of god are actually in the contracts for a good reason they are supposed to eliminate coverage for things that affect many people at the same time no insurance company could possibly bunker enough money to handle such situations and if they could it would end up costing significantly more money for the policy holder so a single accident should not fall in this category now if an unexpected solar storm hit causing equally unexpected faults in the driving software and tens of thousands of accidents all happened at the same time that would be the traditional act of god
106,no i mean the driverless vehicle needs to prioritize the safety of its own inhabitants before following an industry wide decision making process on who to hit in a situation where an accident cant be avoided i totally agree with you that driverless cars will statistically be safer than human drivers
107,ai will brake thats it its not going to jump the curb its not going into oncoming traffic to save lives youre right it never happens on top of that there will be no decision making path is obstructed brake if it hits someone a person would have hit that someone and a lot harder and faster and that someone was in the wrong thats of the people who will die to automated cars it will be because they stepped into the road way illegally and the car makers will eat those people alive in the court rooms should they decide to sue with all the data those cars will record the ai will just brake that is all
108,ai will brake thats it its not going to jump the curb its not going into oncoming traffic to save lives youre right it never happens on top of that there will be no decision making path is obstructed brake if it hits someone a person would have hit that someone and a lot harder and faster and that someone was in the wrong thats of the people who will die to automated cars it will be because they stepped into the road way illegally and the car makers will eat those people alive in the court rooms should they decide to sue with all the data those cars will record the ai will just brake that is all
109,yeah im not a huge fan of utilitarianism but i see the utility no pun intended in the argument for this case one thing that might make the decision process easier is if the driverless car even has the ability to reliably tell differences in age etc at that point i would just argue hit as few people as possible or hit the people you will do less damage to or maybe hit the people that arent following the traffic laws why punish a single person on a side walk because people decided to j walk at the wrong time
110,yes all commercial planes have autopilot and all of those planes can fly themselves for of the flight autopilot is an lru fuction and mainly software if anything more than what weve had since the s you remove and replace the old components with new components autopilot dates to pre world war i
111,spot on and thank you i still dont understand why this debate comes up all vehicles will literally do the same thing just brake there will be no morality core where the car decides on a millisecond if its going to swerve to hit a toddler or run down two jaywalking year olds
112,i would like it to aslo slow down if there are suspcious of it having to brake in the near future for example it detects a group of people waiting to cross the street it slows down enough to avoid pusshing the brake hard if someone decides to jump the same if there is something where a person could hide or in croasroads just in case an asshole without a self driving car ignores the red light a passive driver ai
113,the point of that example is that total number of lives saved still is the metric used in real life situations like medicine people just accept that medicine is not infallible and they still agree to take it so thats still the criterion to decide whether to apply a method that specific medicine i see no reason why that reasoning wont be applied to a transport method self driving ai
114,imagine sueing god lightning destroys your home or kills a family member you decide to sue god by proxy the church literally the only legal defence would be for the church to prove that god doesnt exist fun
115,its interesting as a thought experiment but has no real pragmatic application thats about it a lot of people like to play philosopher but the reality is the cars just wont get into situations where they have to make these weird ethical dilemmas ive been driving for years and never once had to decide between the blind man walking his dog and the bus stop full of teenagers it just doesnt happen now and will happen less when the cars can pay a million times better attention to the roadway than i can
116,yes because ai is a dumb overused term if its possible to safely maneuver around an obstacle thats what most path planning software will do if its not which is what the comment youre replying to assumes brake
117,an open legal lane its not legal to cross a double yellow line or go onto the sidewalk even if they are clear the machine will do whats legal and safe or brake its not going to do any fancy decision making all the traffic laws already dictate what you are supposed to do the machine will just actually do it rather then panic in the case of squirrels the car might brake if no one is behind the car otherwise theyll be paste
118,its misleading to say pilots arent needed they absolutely are needed for all portions of the flight the airplane wont do a single thing without the pilots telling it what to do all the autopilot does is follow the commands entered into the system by a pilot every action the airplane does was commanded by the pilot the autopilot does a fantastic job of holding altitude and heading it does zero decision making which is what the pilots are there for real life example the other day i was flying some passengers to aspen the weather looked great when we departed but as we came within range of the airport we learned that the winds had picked up aspen is a one way in one way out airport for my company because of the mountainous terrain surrounding it i can only land on runway and i can only take off on runway the winds had picked up to kts gusting to what this means is that we would be landing with a tailwind this isnt the end of the world in most situations if the winds are light enough and the runway is long enough however in this situation the gust factor of knots was past our maximum tailwind component of knots even though the visibility and ceilings were vfr we could land visually from cruise without needing an approach we had no choice but to divert it wasnt a super hard decision to make when presented with the information but its just one of the thousands of situations that can pop up at any given time that requires a human to make the decision
119,nope there was a dude that sued the devil once the court reviewed the filing and decided that since it was unclear whether the court had jurisdiction and since the devil seemingly couldnt be served with a copy of the complaint the case would need to be dismissed enmwikipediaorgwikiunited_states_ex_rel_gerald_mayo_v_satan_and_his_staff
120,the solution to this problem is vv communication all within milliseconds your car decides to brake and tells the car behind it that its braking that car decides to brake and so on
121,in that specific case sure but if you can come up with some simple rule for when to land and when not to then yes a computer could do it trivially however thats clearly not the case hence why its good to have a well trained human there ml techniques are very powerful but only in very narrow specific contexts they are nowhere near being ready for something like decide whether or not we should try to land in these conditions
122,even with how far teslas self driving software has come i cant ever imagine being so comfortable that i could actually fall asleep at the wheel
123,that guy is lucky he didnt get killed the software isnt autonomous
124,theres a long damn way to go before the general public is willing to let software control a pound moving vehicle completely autonomously lots of people are going to be hurt or killed in the process
125,maybe he died that would be kinda funny actually if you decide to end it you know set your destination to the morgue pop the cyanide and your body gets neatly and conveniently delivered to your final destination
126,technology hasnt caught up with expectations umm the guy should have been expected to be in an accident and there was no accident if say that this was just the opposite technology surpassed expectations that said dont do this it is stupid and it is dangerous tesla should put software to detect these bypass devices eg constant pull on the wheel and permanently disable ap on those cars
127,is level when the ai decides where you go
128,i think lots of people have considered how distributive it will be thats one of the main reasons its being developed lots of companies would eagerly take self driving trucks over human drivers and would pay lots for them truck drivers cab drivers train operators lots of jobs are going to be lost and that means lots of cost saving for corporations but as has always been true progress doesnt stop just because it makes a group of people unemployed its coming regardless now would be a good transition period for people to decide to pursue other specialties but just like before it wont happen on the bright side the cost might be exorbitant leading to a slower adoption rate
129,yeah ive seen tesla owners say you cant do this because you have to squeeze the wheel every seconds are people able to sleep because they put a clamp on the wheel or do they hack the software
130,it will be but the software thats currently deployed to tesla vehicles is absolutely not suitable for being literally asleep at the wheel you might be fine itll handle typical highway traffic just fine merges are occasionally dicey and construction areas are hands on for sure but that kind of behavior really is asking to crash
131,it can be cheated rather easily often people place fruit in the steering wheel or other objects that fool the system theres plenty of videos on youtube demonstrating this also if you read the article you will see that he has a device to trick the system they are suggesting the the fsd is built into the car but the software for you to do so has not been enabled they leave an asterik next to it with a note that says when they implement it for that reason
132,only thing i could see happening differently from or maybe just in addition to your scenario is i believe there would be more carpooling sort of like a mini bus with a route decided by the first passenger first passenger calls the thing up gets in sets the destination but then if someone along the route is going the same general direction they get picked up along the way or maybe people who live in the same area who call up a ride are put into a lobby that could be filled and the ride takes them to their destinations individually so long as those destinations are reasonably close to one another idk i could see this benefitting the environment more and the companies who provide the services
133,oh and other benefits you never have to defrost your car you never have to worry about maintenance you never have to get an mot you never have to change a tire you never have to gas it up you never have to park it you never have to wait for it to warm up in the mornings err just fyi this is not necessarily a good thing the way people handle maintenance right now is inconvenient sure but at least gives the consumer more power in this equation moving to a subscription based service you are going to be paying for maintenance for tire changes for gas and other wear and tear items on a vehicle but thats just going to be part of your fee the kicker here is that you no longer get to decide how they decide to perform their maintenance and with what parts companies down the value chain will start to charge premiums for their parts and the subscription service companiesfleet owners will pass that cost onto the end user tacked on with their own hidden fees to create extra revenue sure capitalism might dictate that competition will weed out any extraneous price gouging from the companies but in practice we as a society move closer and closer to consolidation and tech monopolies as time progresses you can argue that the cost savings from other benefits will cancel this out initially and that may be true but down the line this is going to be another part of the equation that is out of the consumers hands you have noted some tangible benefits but i dont have faith that the end user will win in this specific regard
134,what about hacking or something like that if a hacker decides to kill a ton of people and gets into the cars they can if they want also the government can easily use this for their own corrupt purposes
135,ah and let the car decide to kill you to save lives
136,as a software developer i am equally excited about this and deeply frightened
137,im putting the blame on the driver and everyone who endorses the behavior and reshares stunt driving agreed although i am guilty of taking pleasure in the subreddit ridiotsincars and rconvenientcop to be fair id like to see less post on it for the sake of humanity obviously youre a big rah rah tesla dude im more of an anti fossil fuel dude since ive had enough with harley davidson bikers spouting loud pipes save lives and the germans automakers whom are literal convicted frauds for designing the absolute best emission cheating hardware and software i know its a hyperbole hatred but its the internet so i can vent i guess beside it just happens that the best ev is also spearheading on av there are other ways to use assisted driving features that dont involve trying to become viral on the internet through safety feature hacking and doing eyes closed driving you and i can blame teslas marketing and misused of the term autopilot when it comes to the ordinaryaverage joe as their interpretation can be optimistic as you have said it yourself youre agreeing its idiotic but then saying my opinion is wrong andor would differ if it was a different brand well which is it genius am i right or wrong youre proving my point fantastically by going after me and not the driver or person sharing this unsafe crap just going off what other redditors have pointed out regarding your posts history beside we can agree to disagree but as i see it the person sharing this post or the pro tesla mod had no wrong doing you can either choose to join the rank of people who think this is cool or join those of us in reality who dont think some rich jerk should make a commuter road their playground to flex and create viral shock content im a pessimist i dont think avs should be benchmarked against human drivers but human drivers especially na ones should be held up to a higher standards a riced up honda civic weaving in and out of tight spots in heavy traffic could be more research is needed probs more dangerous than a tesla on autopilot besides senior citizens might benefit from autonomy the most as it enables their freedom for longer while posing as lesser hazard on the road
138,worked in insurance for years made it to lower senior management in two global corporations and have a diploma in insurance really im a totally interesting and swell guy who absolutely didnt own several different shades of grey suit honest im going to say on this one that i disagree an insurance company is in the business of lowering risk exposure against premium charged in order to increase their profit margin essentially the less they have to pay out the better sometimes they do this with good advice to the customer based on their knowledge of what likely causes of loss are particularly type of door lock or burglar alarm works better they will advise you fit it and can lower your premium accordingly they know with those youre less likely to have a loss and they get to keep more premium across the pool of risks they insure every year anyway currently to insure a car they have to assess individual drivers ability lifestyle carelessness decision making skills location commute type of parking level of car usage type of use and experience some they can ask you some they can use big data to figure the trends but in a lot of cases they simply cant know as much about you as you know about you so their premium charged has to guess and factor that in i worked on multiple books of motor insurance that had a combined operating ratio money in verses money out of over you need less than to be making money and these were the big insurance companies with the really good systems low operating costs internal efficiencies and damn good actuaries in the uk the motor industry lost money every year for over a decade i dont know the stats these daystheyd make up for it in other areas for an insurance company where in the uk it is compulsory for a driver to have at least third party liability to cover you damaging other things or people theres simply a lot of stuff that you the driver could do that they cant account for in their numbers but will have to pay for if you screwed up but an automatic car not owned by an individual but by company trying to run a profit themselves with known software and hardware combinations known and predictable use cases secure storage facilities regular maintenance and user feedback reporting and a large data set provided by the company themselves that reports all incidents and not just the ones that the drivers do actually report thats going to lead to a much more predictable loss data set and you have a company to sue when it goes wrong suing a regular person for the money they dont have can be a hiding to nothing so the way i see it insurance companies cant wait to get their hands on the business model of automated drive and fleet pool car operations where the unknown human element is a much more manageable in the insurance press its been a topic of discussion for years with some people actually thinking the biggest resistance wont come from the insurance companies but from the population resisting having their freedom to drive taken away from them and from governments that will be slow to unpack the current insurance legislation and open it up to allow innovation in the market the insurance companies want more money for their shareholders they often do it by slicing the back end operation which i in operations hated them for it made people their own staff have worse quality lives all so the shareholders could benefit paying less in claims is a much much more lucrative option and may even stop them for a while from carving into themselves for the extra cash i think they want the automation they wont resist it its way too much good money

140,im a great driver never been in an accident except when an asswad in the mcdonalds parking lot decided it was taking too long and backed out onto the hood of my car but my cousin and her whole family were in a head on collision on a lane highway when some kid swerved across the line my family was beaten up a bunch but ok the kid who swerved died on impactever since then im super cautiousparanoid on lane highways
141,so yeah me spending part of my day yesterday in this sub having a thoughtful conversation about deep sea autonomous boats for data collection was part of an act and im just here to stalk a mod who posts k upvote stories everyday there is no benefit to anyone to share this dudes stupidity and it is both the driver and the ops goal to get people watching the stunt which should be ignored and shunned for its danger and me saying something about it and getting a modicum of support has pissed you the hell off because apparently you really like the video too i wouldnt know truthfully because all youve done it attack me but ill infer until i hear otherwise for the dozenth time this story is trash and sharing it at all is encouraging stunt drivers to get more attention for life risking behavior the tech is cool and has potential show it off on private property imagine a bulletproof glass company decided to stand at the edge of their property and fire at their glass toward a public street filled with cars would you be cool with sharing that video i mean the tech had been proven right
142,i read the title to this and can not decide weather the op is serious
143,not a bad problem to have i mean literally thats what donnation means i dont need it anymore compare that to the situation of charities that report because so many people scam online there are less and less people willing to donate online the general idea was we have unneccesary deaths people die one from a gunshot wound to the head the other one from a missing liver translant lets cut that short by taking the otherwise still useable gunshot victims liver and sowing it into the other patients body we can save one of them guaranteed the idea was never we have a right to those organ numbers we have a right to now demand those organs the idea was never we now get to complain because large numbers of organs are not there where we need them the general idea is innovate your way out of this for example allow some donors to decide for themself how their organs will be used for example i myself would have no problems with my organs being donnated to a poor schlob who never won anything to specify that if my reccipient has plans like climb mount everrest ride the bike or have an active and healthy social life go tell him to fck himself and prioritise the bottom of the list these people whom you wouldnt trust with a fresh vegan liver give them my liver put a smile on their faces shit on the guy who plans to run with the bulls or who has an instagramm account donnate your heart to the bottom of the transplant waiting list your liver to an recovering alcoholic your skin to someone who looks like a two and otherwise would need skingrafts from their own ass and your dick to someone who put chronic masturbation under hobbies let my shit go to people who actually appreciate it not take it for granted i could see a lot of people out of their free will donnating their organs and actually feeling good about it skin blood liver shit i take it like with the computer if anything can be reused before you toss it into the biohazard bin and burry it in an abandoned mineshaft be my gust grab what you need to when it is clear that i dont need it anymore just dont give it to the prick with the hope and stars in their eyes give it to themiserable bastard that has never won anything and make them for once feel like they own the world the downside would be that you would actually have to respect those wishes and such you know i will not be around to check anymore but i am sure it would be a hoot to tell mister schmidt from b that the medical board has a heart for him even though the medical board cant legally give that heart to anyone else but too often when a board decides who gets the organs and who gets a second chance i wanna wipe the smug grins off of their faces and go yea she ugly as fuck but shes a two so the rmeistermalkav clause grips and she gets his skin yes all of it see what she needs cut off the rest make a trendy bag out of it and this is where i see the problem the doctors would never agree to actually respect the donors wishes and hand over their power they would allways push for this little bit of extra of finger waving of such and of course there would be the the people that go i want my body parts to go to someone who is white i know it is harsh but better then publically whining about how fewer transplants we will have because more and more people will surive would be to take the good with the bad just increase the numbers every racist bastard who gets his wish means one fewer place on that list needing to be filled an other option would be medically assisted suicide i am dead serious on that one if all you care is get places of of that list go fuck your ethics board untill they bleed from both ends and offer assisted suicide have a suicide coaster in the back that kills you in a painless safe and guaranteed way in exchange for the right to harvest the organs of course respect these peoples wishes what they want to be done with the organs and the grafts but in the end if you are good enough to whine publically about the list let me remind you that if you pushed for harvesting rights to suicide victims bodies your numbers would look quite different yes there would be the option about not doing harm but that could be done with a patient activated mechanism or and this would be my preferred option actually look into technology look into artificial hearts look into stem cell research and make sure all your people on that waiting list understand that if they vote the people against stem cell research out of office they may actually do the world a bigger favor then by leaving them in and just signing up to be donors just you know become single issue voters for an election my best case only hand the advertising contracts to inform about organ donnations to people who are donors make fun fact sheets allow me to specify my wsh that nobody who is an sjw should get anything from me but if there is any miserable sick son of a bitch that is just a grouch give him my body and tell him to toast me once in a while staple it in and see how it goes use what you can from my body and go fuck your ethics board if you can get it out of my body without retching uncontrollably you are entitled to have it if any of my body ends up in an art project go buy a big pack of smokes for the nearest smoker and tell him my story but i would rather rot completely intact underground and make sure maggots and shit get my body then go to the afterlife with the secure knowledge that my bodyparts are taken for granted and to be distributed as seen fit by a team of medical experts
144,well then i guess the only thing to do is add in some software glitches that will cause in every cars to randomly crash every day to keep up the quotas
145,legislate a random number generator somewhere in the self driving software
146,this may seem too black and white but couldnt stem cell research solve this problem the us has decided to make this illegal when it could be a major step forward in saving lives
147,theres a simple software based solution for this set up a tracking system that keeps track of the size and wait times of the transplant lists and then randomly crashes cars until the list is at an acceptable wait time
148,part of the problem here is the us has an opt in system where initially you are not an organ donor or become one only when you decide to be countries with much higher rates of organ donation use an opt out system were initially we are all organ donors until we decide to opt out switching to an opt out system would vastly increase the rate of organ donation saving many lives
149,at this stage of self driving development they are simply being overly optimistic about its reliability but in time when in actual use there will likely be enough equipment malfunctions and software glitches to maintain the supply of human organs from chauffeured victims
150,meh once the cars become self aware and decide to exterminate us all organ donations are going to be the least of our worries
151,a part of an opt out system would have to include public awareness in the us i am sure people would think doctors might not try as hard to save you if there are people who need organs when the affordable care act was passed people thought death panels would decide when people would die i still think its quite fundamentally morally wrong to not have each and every individual knowingly choose what happens after they go rather than creating an incentive for the state to keep people ignorant of it the choice would still be there both opt out and opt in provide people the opportunity to choose the only difference is the default setting i think that most people dont care what happens to their organs after they die i think that laziness keeps more form opting in that single extra step of signing up to be an organ donor might means viable organs not going to people that need them those that dont want to donate can still opt out with the same procedure we use now to opt in but they will to go to the bottom of organ donation lists if they ever need one
152,quietus you decide when vqyytrspsi
153,in a very few cases there was a software issue but most of them were caused by either people not paying attention and then using this as an excuse or people stacking multiple floor mats which can impede the accelerator pedal from going to a neutral position old people are notorious for stacking multiple mats ive seen people have as many as six floor mats stacked on top of each other sometimes accompanied by a thick towel source worked for toyota for years
154,thatll be a load of fun when someone decides the same should hold true of wills
155,thats a nearly religious statement youve no data for that you cant its faith in computers and their superiority beta software should not drive cars
156,i must disagree with the articles pronouncement of what we need to accept the burden is on the technology developers to clearly demonstrate that their design is better than the status quo enough better to justify the added cost in the earlier days of self driving cars there was a wholly unwarranted presumption on the part of many that self driving cars were going to be absolutely safe and the general public is slowly becoming educated on the limitations of the technology if you really understand how deep learning systems operate youll know that theyre a total black box that cannot be verified to operate properly by any manner of proof its been demonstrated that changing of even a single pixel can change object classification decisions its been demonstrated that pasting small images of other signs in the blank space of signs can cause them to be misrecognized because the black block deep learning recognizers are designed to read signs at a variety of scales in the recent uber case a software failure caused the perception of a pedestrian obstacle in the middle of the road to be effectively ignored all this technology is also going to cost money itll make cars more expensive but the ability to drive away from the destination enables cars to be shared which can greatly affect the actual cost of ownership the number of cars on the road and the occupancy and eventually the need for parking spaces nevertheless if the added cost of the technology isnt balanced by a decrease in the cost of killing and maiming drivers passengers occupants of other vehicles pedestrians and bystanders we should be highly resistant to accepting these products thats not to say its the way its going to happen people were so in love with their cell phones that they failed to resist the temptation to use them while they were driving exacting an extremely high cost in lives lost and injuries that persist to the present day users are paying the price of this in their automobile insurance cost but these costs are not redeemed by the companies responsible for the manufacture marketing or sales of cell phones so far cell phone makers havent been obliged to pay for a failure to make their products safe regulation has encouraged makers to add facilities for hands free use which has not yet been proven to make them safe to use while driving indeed studies to date suggest that users still become too cognitively occupied to safely operate a vehicle and a phone together current half driving cars on the market present another danger particularly given users penchants for operating them beyond the stated capabilities defeating safety systems such as by pressing an orange into the steering wheel and so forth theres been clear evidence that reducing the drivers workload with these systems makes the driver less attentive to the task rendering them unable to assist the half driver when it malfunctions or needs to pass control back to the driver unlike airplanes where there may be many seconds before an autopilot controlled plane becomes unsafe or uncontrollable the geometry of the driving task demands sub second responses to unusual conditions
157,people are going to die at first get over it is probably not the greatest stance to take if youre trying to promote widespread adoption in order to flatten the learning curve for the driving algorithms when theres a perfectly viable alternative available that people have been using for years most people will be happy to say no thanks let me know when youve worked all the kinks out and then ill think about it even if they are statistically more safe in an autonomous vehicle the technology needs strong adoption because truly safe autonomous driving is going to require millions upon millions of miles driven so that nearly every combination of scenarios can be encountered and appropriately mitigated through software learning then theres the whole casualty insurance elephant in the room that no one seems to want to address
158,why does everyone just assume things are secure and wont ever be used maliciously we cant even keep hotel door locks from being hacked or a a simple database with peoples information secure but we want a complicated software system in charge of a vehicle this is a vicious cycle every time something new comes out medical tech wifi whatever corporations fail to think about security first they designed wireless insulin pumps and pacemakers with few if any security protocols in place lets put million cars on the road with that same philosophy good idea
159,all of this is fair but in this instance uber fucked up their software and hardware was actually fine they just had it configured wrong for marketing reasons i think its completely reasonable to have a law mandating that any self driving car has an emergency stop feature and that this feature must be enabled
160,i really advise people to watch the video the scribes oath we need to hold software to a higher engineering standard that we do today otherwise its going to have really bad consequences
161,i dont really want software making life or death decisions for me or my family
162,stop these articles stop saying death equivalency is good enough thats not the issue at all this issue is that driving in a automated car was like being taken on a ride by a depressed chauffeur huffing glue sure most of the time he does great but every once and a while he does something completely irrational before passing out leading to easy fatalities we have to be able to relax ourselves these articles advocates blind trust it doesnt matter if my chauffeur thinks its okay to drive full speed into the side of a semi truck sometimes because hes still better than the average driver does the psychological mindset of the passengers matter at all this is not respect or trust its blind submission to a ridiculously flawed driver what if this chauffeur was x more likely to cause life crippling permanent injuries in every crash than the average driver what if every fatality it caused was a small child that he runs over at mph because those damn kids are too small to see yet he still only killed as many humans as the average driver nhtsa is right to advocate for x less fatalities before its ready i think were getting pretty close to trustworthy self driving cars and most people dont realize how damn easy it will be to achieve once we have the right software
163,wonder how people will feel if the ai in their car makes the decision to sacrifice its passengers rather than pedestrians public eg if car loses its brakes has the choice between running off a cliff killing the passengers inside vs running into a crowd of people certainly killing many more would anyone be ok with getting into a car that may decide to kill its passengers given the right circumstances
164,this idea that we should accept self driving cars killing people is questionable at least to me now self driving tech comes from private companies who owns the code eh so nobody knows whats in the code eh so therefore consider this scenario a government with less than free and democractic ideals cough china cough implements a self driving software that does not recognise certain people dissenters as humans but their death would look like a traffic accident right in fact it would be perfectly easy for a government to decide for some features ex a hijab or sunglasses or even black skin to be not human and thus eliminate undesirables in traffic accidents as long as corporations can hide behind the auto car kills less than manual car defence the life or death of every person walking down the street will be decided based on a hidden piece of code that may or may not discriminate against you oh software discrimination totally happened before i remember reading something a while back about the face unlock tech being less accurate on asians than europeans imagine this sort of thing happening with a car coming towards you
165,this idea that we should accept self driving cars killing people is questionable at least to me now self driving tech comes from private companies who owns the code eh so nobody knows whats in the code eh so therefore consider this scenario a government with less than free and democractic ideals cough china cough implements a self driving software that does not recognise certain people dissenters as humans but their death would look like a traffic accident right in fact it would be perfectly easy for a government to decide for some features ex a hijab or sunglasses or even black skin to be not human and thus eliminate undesirables in traffic accidents as long as corporations can hide behind the auto car kills less than manual car defence the life or death of every person walking down the street will be decided based on a hidden piece of code that may or may not discriminate against you oh software discrimination totally happened before i remember reading something a while back about the face unlock tech being less accurate on asians than europeans imagine this sort of thing happening with a car coming towards you
166,so when a self driving car is bound to crash into either a mom with a baby in a troller or a grandpa walking with his grandson how does it decide who to kill and who is responsible for that decision
167,even the smartest fastest computer cant change the laws of physics when a human decides to step into oncoming traffic and the physics dont allow for avoidance the computer is going to switch to calculating how to best protect its passengers and protect bystanders
168,i think self driving cars are going to be an amazing technnological advancement and for of the situations will do good for drivers i personally am worried about a self driving cars decision making process in a trolley problem type of scenario i would hate to be deliberately killed by a self driving car in the drivers seat or as a bystander until a self driving car has the same level of self preservation built in as i do ill still be on the fence
169,i think the issue here is that we are seeking or expecting perfection within the logic of self driving cars as a software architect i do believe that the expectation is incorrect and unrealistic the realistic expectation here is that at least version of the cars should be more safer than the current averages which i do believe that currently autonomous self driving cars are way ahead of the current averages moving forward i think distributed network over cars in which all cars are aware and can communicate with other cars to share data and details about visibility speed alerts etc would be a great benefit and will increase the accuracy of the module even better in the meantime i think self driving cars should be tested and rolled out as they are the testing data that was provided by the car owners is not enough the public needs to start testing and using these cars in every day practice this is the only way we can stabilize and improve this product the public testing of these autonomous cars is the realistic test the technology will improve x the rate when we start a beta testing with retail according to the realistic expectations set i think self driving cars will be a great success cant wait
170,i did my thesis on autonomous vehicle safety people gonna die traffic gonna be safer the only real focus is on who takes the blamepays out the cost auto maker blames the software company software company blames the car owner car owner calls the insurance company who says only the driver is covered well there was no driver so the owner gets to defend themselves against multi billion dollar companies
171,but even our most underdeveloped models will most likely be are already an improvement over a human drivers ability tesla may be going about it haphazardly but have you seen the statistics the last generation of software reduced crashes in teslas by and their goal for this generation is thats including when autopilot is on and off their software has the ability to take the wheel to avoid a crash and the compilations on youtube are great tbh seriously its news when a self driving vehicle kills someone for the same reason its news when a disappears it almost never happens
172,brother and i were discussing this exact thing yesterday waymo cars out here scare the cyclists lol fair enough but remember using cameras and software only its determine the difference between human and wall its already a better drivier than most lol
173,so who pays for the damagesloss of life who is then at fault cant be me i was in the back seat getting a blowjob when my car decided to plow into the pedestrian
174,theres a fundamental misunderstanding here of how good self driving software is currently its largely based on being able to see well painted lines in roadways what about in the snow no good answer what about lanes with unclear paint weve all seen those roads with unclear lanes and paintjobs autos autonomous infrastructure insig iduskcnwx
175,at least self driving technology would improve and learn from the thousands of mistakes made around the network until it decides fuck it kill them all
176,i think the real problem with avs is going to be when one does kill someone and someone now needs to determine was the av or the deceased persons more at fault if it is decided that it was the av who is responsible the owner of the vehicle or the company or companies behind the avs safety equipment which may be a lot more than just one company and this is with a simplified scenario depending on what the final technology requires what happens if external sensors or signal broadcasters are required by avs just to function reliably im thinking especially of snowy or icy conditions where the cars on board sensors may not be able to detect the edge or center of a road reliably right now roads and road signals are mostly paid for by the public if an av kills someone and it was icy and there is a question about whether some road implanted signaling device failed does that make that citycountystate partially responsible this is likely to provide for entirely new departments of lawyers being required in many legal firms to handle the increased demand for both prosecuting and defense lawyers
177,don norman the design of everyday things guy was giving a talk that i was listening to while at work and he brought up an important question that i dont hear about driver less cars how will the car signal to a pedestrian that it has seen them and what should occur next a person can make eye contact and signal to a pedestrian with a gesture but a modern car with no driver doesnt have any way to signal intent from the front except for turn signals how will this work at scale when there are other cars in the area what happens when one car decides to stop and another doesnt what about bikes or scooters how drivers react in various countries differ as well how will the car react when placed in a city with a different car culture than it was produced in what about different cars from different countries in one place what about cars with human and ai drivers on the same road all of this has to be hashed out before driverless cars become a significant presence but i rarely hear anyone who thinks well all have driverless cars in years talk about these life or death problems
178,i think one of the most interesting ethical dilemmas that arises from autonomous vehicles is when a decision has to be made between two highly undesirable outcomes and its left to pure calculation on the machines to make a decision regarding the outcome example you are driving an autonomous vehicle a hazard presents itself where your car must now decide whether to a sacrifice you the driver to save the other person or b sacrifice the other person to save you an autonomous vehicle would have to be programmed with parameters to make this decision if the hazard is a child and youre a middle aged person should not the vehicle sacrifice you would you get into a vehicle that you know could sacrifice you given certain parameters equally is it ethical that one could buy an autonomous vehicle that guarantees not to sacrifice its driver this is in my view going to be one of the biggest hinderances in the uptake of autonomous vehicles
179,i think that most people wont own self driving cars in the future but rent them perhaps like a subscription for the car so whatever company owns the vehicles can maintain them and keep the software up to date and such that or like a taxi service having just played through detroit become human i think they show the most accurate guess at the future of self driving cars where they are like taxis but you can still own and use cars you drive yourself but the self driving vehicles all work as taxis and buses so insurance isnt a problem for the average person its all on whatever company is running the vehicles
180,it depends who the government decides to put priority of life on in the event of a crash me or the general population if my car acts in my interest then its no different than anything else i foot the bill if my car acts in the interest of everyone then i aint footing shit
181,the manufacturer andor software company
182,the thing that freaks me out the most are the people who have no idea what to do a broken traffic light if a traffic light is totally off you dont get to decide that the road youre on is the more important road and to go through the light without any hesitation
183,to bring autonomous cars up to the standards of in my opinion it has much more to do with who do you blame when things go wrong the software hardware etc the the trolley problem vbopfkcwyyw after all a an autonomous car is in control right
184,you answered your own question and manufacturerssoftware companies can buy liability insurance
185,beta software should not drive cars i agree so much with this
186,currently theres a pilot in these cars and heshes supposed to take over in case something goes wrong yet in the uber case the driver wasnt paying attention id make it mandatory to have a system in the car that alerts the driver if hes distracted and exceeding a quota should be treated as reckless driving in the uber case the pedestrian was detected and triggered an emergency braking event which was disabled in software it also didnt alert the driver huge mistake in my opinion
187,this question is so tedious self driving vehicles arent going to be doing any complicated decision making its going to be doing absolutely zero decision making based on morals its going to be following relatively simple instructions in case of a threat such as swerve if possible otherwise stay in the lane and decelerate as much as possible humans are absolute shite in emergency situations so theyre certainly not going to be worse than humans in an emergency plus im willing to reckon you didnt spend a lot of time in a morality class before they let you get your license these situations are already really rare with self driving cars theyll be even more rare were talking about the kind of situation you might expect to occur once in a thousand lifetimes of driving to the extent vehicles can be programmed to minimize the loss of human life thats a good thing for you even if it is lives outside the vehicle because youre more likely to be the person outside the vehicle than in its a whole bunch of nothing the true immorality would be letting an extra million people die every year because self driving vehicles arent perfect
188,id say the cs industry is worse obfuscation is so easy in software as is building silos and so on then theres the esoteric domain specific languages and technologies and their leaky abstractions technology with undocumented features or backdoors then theres the people
189,no software will ever be perfect and even if we somehow created this magical perfect software you still have mechanical issues killing people and thats never going away either
190,if i get killed because the self driving car fails to get a critical software update or segfaults on a crappy firmware bug im gonna be pissed
191,i grew up in germany got my license there lived there for years then i moved to the us had to take a test to get a drivers license here and have been driving here for years now yes the difference is absolutely real i dont remember how many hours of driving school you have to take in germany but it was a lot in the us its about half as much and your terrible driver parent can teach you the rest therefore perpetuating bad habits in germany i had to take a one hour driving test in real traffic with situations demanding real control and decision making in the us the driving test was on an enclosed parking lot with nobody else on it was minutes long and involved exactly three things parallel parking three way turn and stopping at a stop sign drivers in germany generally follow rules and respect other drivers they may be speeding but they typically let people merge lanes use their signals and pay attention to traffic of course there are exceptions but they are exceptions in the us egocentric drivers who only have their own interest in mind are the norm you have to plan two miles out to get to the right lane if your exit is coming up because you never know who will let you merge when you have to get off the freaking highway people drive slow on the left lane you get overtaken on the left right anything goes people keep no proper distance to other cars because that would mean you leave room for other cars to merge into your lane on my commute i see about of drivers around me on their phone or otherwise not paying attention to the road
192,for some reason i enjoy the idea that if someone kills me and its their fault theres atleast someone responsible and potentially punished for what he did if some self driving tesla kills me im collateral damage for testing out software musk wont be responsible if that happens nothing will happen
193,right the difference is that the drunk driver gets arrested and goes to jail for murder there is an entire system set up for what you describe has uber been charged for killing that women where they even at fault it seems that the justice system will be more in favor of software than the person run over this new dystopian world
194,more complex decisionslike swerve to avoid a grandmother vs a young girl logic rightsave the kid let the computer decide that heavy of a thing and you might as well let the computer decide everything
195,sounds like a good way to get malicious software installed in your car
196,why would this be true i would assume your insurer is liable or the car manufacturer or software vendor would be liable makes no sense for an individual to be personally liable for the actions of the software
197,the problem really is that self driving technology will diffuse responsibility for deaths that it causes lets say that a self driving car kills someone and later its proven in court that if the programming had been slightly different the death wouldnt have occurred who is at fault for that do you blame the programmer what if its a team of programmers who all collaborated to write the software what if they were just programming the way the middle management told them to what if middle management was just trying to adhere to strict deadlines set by the ceo what if the ceo says he has to have those deadlines to fulfill his fiduciary duty to shareholders et al when an entire company is at fault the responsibility is diffused and the only real solution is that the company pays a settlement to the family of the dead this allows for companies to get away with murder if the settlements are less costly than improving their software
198,no youre better off with low latency decision making in a driving situation and no one outside of stopping time seconds needs to know where you are at all
199,people are always so fast to dismiss ideas on the grounds of i dont want a self driving car doing mph in a rural environment at night in winter in fog with my lights switched off its not going to be like that on day one phase one could be motorwayinterstate roads fast wide safe roads with every car going the same direction at effectively the same speed phase two could be years later following multiple software revisions hardware upgrades and improved safety records phase two could be urban roads limited speeds with both onboard and roadside sensors and monitoring phase three could be even more years later rural roads with even more software and hardware improvements realtime satellite updates of dangers unseen etc etc by the time we get to phase iii itll be so commonplace to allow autodriven cars on the fastest roads that my hope is that we will have stopped allowing the evolved chimpanzees to drive themselves on the major roads
200,sure most people know how to handle a way stop run up to it as fast as possible come to a complete stop or not sometimes its just okay to slow down just a little and go look around now that theyre there and have no idea whose turn it is wave someone else to go whose turn its not stop and wait until the next cross traffic car thats a block away arrives and makes a complete stop sit there when its really busy then decide to turn on their left turn signal while everyone is trying to figure out whose turn it is andor start to go then stop then go again and make a turn with no signal at the last second s
201,tbf the area is not as poorly lit as the uber video suggested someone who lives in the area posted photos here on reddit even if that were accurate the car uses sensors in addition to simply visible light thats one of the appeals of self driving cars they can use sensory inputs not available to our meaty bodies the sensors on the uber car detected the person and the software registered the sensors detecting her as a false positive and made no attempt to avoid her an attentive human driver would not have killed that woman im all for self driving cars but ubers tech was not road ready if that situation yielded a false negative googles cars have far more hours on the road and nothing like that incident
202,nah i understand the concept of a zipper merge although i didnt know thats what it was called and i have no problem with people waiting until the lane is ending to merge it was really more the fact that he waited until the lane started to end and then stomped on the gas and tried to pass half a dozen cars and merge in front of them and then acted like they were the assholes for not slamming on their brakes to let him in had he just kept speed he would have ended up in front of me and i was already slowing down to let him merge when he decided to speed up and try to pass as many people as possible but also the fact that he saw every single car other than himself get in the right lane and still decided to stay in the left if you see every car but yourself get in the lane that isnt ending its probably going to be safer to take any opening you can prior to the lane ending instead of waiting until the last second and trying to squeeze in edit also my wording was kind of bad of us didnt go from the left lane to the right lane we were kind of evenly distributed between the two lanes and then those of us in the left lane just moved into the open spaces in the right lane as the lane was about to close
203,yeah but then there are many people like me who hate public transport i dont want to sit with so many people in a bus or train or have to stand because its so full and i dont want to be dependent on the time when it will arrive or drive off i want to drive alone i want to drive off from home exactly the time i want so that i am at my location maybe minutes before work and not hour earlier or whatever i want to decide myself when and where i drive and dont want to be dependent on public transport how should i go shopping with so many bags should i carry and hold everything in a full bus never
204,so dont get me wrong self driving cars will be significantly safer than human drivers deaths a year in the us so even if it reduces by half that is deaths per day that is a lot of legal work and reviewing of software to prevent recalls i wouldnt know of any software engineer who would be into working on updates for recalls because the rate of deaths from your self driving company is higher than your competitors the non stop requests to go speak to congress to plead your case in why they dont shut your company down how many is enough of a reduction in deaths to not become an issue is a day below the threshold to continue to not have to fix the issues with the software is okay the good thing about people driving is that the responsibility is fully on the human driver they are worse by the responsibility is distributed across the entire driving population it isnt the responsibility of a couple of companies its these problems that mean self driving cars wont be legal in our lifetimes
205,its not a to conversion though you dont need a ton of coders each truck does not need its own mechanic or coder one or a couple mechanics is normally responsible for an entire fleet of trucks at a company and those jobs already exist theyll just get trained in new models so this is not even a created job as for coders welleach truck is gonna have the exact same software onboard give or take a few options from factory youll only need a few dozen to a few hundred coders for the entire lineup of a whole manufacturers vehicles this is in contrast to the hundreds of thousands possibly millionsof trucker positions that would get eliminated youll lose potentially millions of trucker positions but only gain maybe a few thousand or couple tens of thousands coder positions its still going to be a huge net loss in jobs
206,ask the insurance companies this question there needs to be a clear answer to who is liable in a crash before your insurance company will sign off on the policy human in the vehicle means said human would be liable how would you like paying for a crash caused by fords ai software lovely right no human meanswho is liable does nationwide go after ford or tesla or whoever then dont think auto manufacturers would let that one flythey are eager to make the software but dont want any liability once it leaves the factory until that question gets answered likely via some sort of new law your insurance company would not even sign off on a policy with a car that has no human in it and since no one is eager to volunteer to be liable for damages caused soley by ai this human free vehicle aint gonna happen anytime soon
207,xb mid thirties single with k usd in cash no house no debt my physician career too stressful do i just push on for more yrs do i start over and retrain as software engineer my childhood dream no you do not push on for years hopefully if you are a decent physician you understand the negative effects of mental stress and daily unhappiness many people have changed careers much later in life than mid s xb could i smartly invest large chunk in cryptostock to make money and do low paid job crypto seems like an unreasonable risk to me there are much safer reliable and predictable investment options you can discuss this in rpersonalfinance
208,my intent is not to smash your dreams but software can be extremely stressful too needlessly so depending where you work and who with you wont be working on your own writing code for the most part which is what most people enjoy doing as a hobby that is about of the job these days and progressively becoming less and less what you learned years ago will likely not be relevant nowadays sadly yes the consequences of failure are low in software but there are still consequences the stress doesnt come from the rational fear of killing someone but there are still lots of pressures on software engineers in certain environments not all are equal or rational in fact some can be quite toxic since you mentioned your social life software devs are not always a social bunch it is a stereotype with a lot of truth to it it can be quite lonely for highly extroverted people that said people with good people skills are needed in our line of work consider the career by all means it can be a good job with decent pay but do not assume that the grass is greener on the other side its a highly competitive field that is very oversaturated at the entry level personally i would try speak to your superior about what you are going through before making any decisions it sounds like you are highly self critical which can quickly turn into self doubt maybe you are experiencing what is called impostor syndrome this is the kind of thing that follows you through life wherever you go if you dont address it so please get some help before making any hasty decisions
209,throwing a bunch of money randomly into the stock market or worse crypto is a great way to lose all of it the odds are astronomical against it actually making a significant amount of money in the near term to the point that it would rescue you from your current situation i cant speak to software engineering as a path but it sounds like an area where someone with a medical degree and unique skills even without a degree would have a very unique niche to fill im sure medical software companies employ doctors in some capacity already start researching and making networking connections there go to conferences you wouldnt normally go to etc make the job change without wasting time and money on a degree
210,i dont know what im talking about but if i were you i would go back to school and train to be a software engineer and living frugally off my k perhaps investing a good chunk with a stock broker college for a software engineer is only years and in todays environment any computer science jobs usually require a degree plus the material has changed a lot in years youre going to be miserable if you pushed through another years doing this youll be in years anyway assuming youre right now might as well spend those years getting a degree in something you enjoy and spend the next doing what you enjoy start at a community college for the first years to save costs and then transfer or do it all online if that works better
211,the way this could work is a company has a fleet of union operated trucks that company decides to buy driverless trucks the next week the union tries to negotiate for a year guarantee that their truckers will still have jobs in years company refuses and union strikes the union negotiates for a year guarantee and a pay raise company acts upset but they were prepared for an year phase out
212,they can serve the community make the case for automation and make the public case they are safe they can just pile on the fully autonomous miles while it wont improve the driving it can be a useful test for scaling up actual driverless operations testing remote software testing running hundreds of cars without drivers etc
213,you misunderstand first let me clarify my statement i am saying that it would take tesla more than years to create something as confidentreliable as this video with their current hardware and i know they plan on continuing with this hardware as that is their strategy and they have been promising fsd with this current hardware take a company that is pretty good at innovating i agree tesla is great at innovating and an extremely exciting company however for them to create what you see in this video with their hardware and strategy will several times harder than what waymo has done it will require vastly more technology breakthroughs that are not in the foreseeable future if tesla were to drop their current strategy and hardware and start over and create a waymo clone i am sure they could do that in years or so but they do not intent to do that when you have pretty much half a million cars or more collecting driving data worldwide on edge cases sigh you and everyone else have got to drop this man its a useful tool but is really far less relevant and important than you believe waymo has at last publishing in a fleet of vehicles even if they quadrupled that its still less than vehicles out in the wild collecting data irrelevant i dont think its a hardware issue at this time its more getting the software right yes but when you have less hardware redundancies the software doesnt need to be a little better it needs to be x x times better k people that already bought it its going to be a massive change only k its gotta be higher than this tesla is selling k vehicles per quarter years is probably my best case idea for teslas software to be at this level we are seeing i share your excitement and enthusiasm its fun to dream i agree wouldnt that be something if that turned about to be the case but i hope you arent getting in to deep into the fantasy
214,but as i said its completely irrelevant if theres a driver in the seat there is nothing more important waymo is running cars without a driver or backup driver so their software has to handle what comes up without any way around it waymo is truly handling what comes up in real time so for example here running into a cop that could not have been predicted vux_nupfq i am asking you in how long until tesla can show something like waymo is doing today are you still saying within months or do you want to change to something longer
215,ive been putting off getting my license for a while now im after seeing this ive decided to just forgo it altogether the idea of driving scares the hell out of me i cant wait until autonomous cars on the road outnumber regular ones car enthusiasts are going to be mad as hell once this really takes off and humans behind the wheel are banned
216,sometimes i like to take the long way home just to unwind and see the scenery this has already been discussed a few months ago routing software ui needs to get a lot better and support waypoints detours etc that said not only is this not a really difficult problem to solve its in the interest of the fleets to make it easy as they can make more money this is especially true for longer trips where you want to stop and see the sights or hit antique shops on the way or something sometimes i just drive to the park during lunch and take a nap in my seat this is a better example i think you could do it but at least at first it would be expensive so you wont once the capacity of the network is at scale i do think this might get cheaper but it will probably always cost something sometimes i sit for longer than necessary in the walmart parking lot in order to catch up on texts this isnt a big deal i expect the car will wait for minutes or so to let you put in your destination a lot of this depends on how much idle room is available sometimes i pull a sudden u turn because i saw something interesting see the first reply while you might be less inclined to do it it shouldnt be a problem once there is better route planning
217,you could just as easily say that about a vehicle that accepts voice commands it depends on what the command is there are endless limitations and rules governing what vehicles are street legal today false rules that govern motor vehicles are finite and strictly codified in documents like the ca vehicle code http leginfolegislaturecagovfacescodestocselectedxhtml toccodeveh freedom never has been and never will be absolute no one said it was if as i suspect at some point society finds there are enough advantages to allowing exclusively self driving vehicles on public roads then it will likely happen nope if people get that stupid the human race will have already killed itself off if you want to be against that thats fine but theres no need to invent dubious technological reasons it cant happen just say youre against the idea on its merits as long as enough people agree with you youll be fine wow youre the one imaging technology that no one has even thought about developing to justify banning manual drive cars you really just dont have a clue you dont get to define what people want from self driving cars nor who gets a place in the conversation thankfully no i dont get to decide but im sure as hell going to point out stupid ideas when i see them
218,because some people have decided that the government needs to do something to fix a problem even if that something is stupid tbh self driving cars makes more sense than requiring sobriety testing for all drivers i dont drink either i just think once someone gets an idea in their head that the government needs to fix something the solution will probably be stupid and if it wasnt a stupid solution we wouldve done it already with bipartisan support
219,nah bikes arent going to be self driving or need laser range finders theyre just talking about having more information about what the cyclist is doing or going to do so for example if you turn the front wheel the car will want to know that so it can predict which direction youre going to go and if you begin to slow down the car whose sensor might not be as sensitive might want to know this in advance and both of these functions could be accomplished with a small device you stick on the handlebars which has an accelerometer and gyroscope in it like your phone in fact your phone could perform the function with an app and they already sell cell handlebar mounts for cellphones finally this could be optional an additional safety feature like a helmet im sure the cars wont require this information to drive around you but being able to predict your movement will increase safety if you suddenly decide to cut left across traffic for whatever reason for a child this could be a life safer and all you need to do is stick that little solar or usb powered thingy on there and theyre good to go could even integrate the bell and a headlamp into it
220,tf no thank you id like an emergency override just in case i mean i know computers never glitch and all software comes bug free these days but i still feel a bit paranoid about this
221,terrorists and government will love these self driving vehicles hack the software and you have a lethal remote controlled weapon
222,self driving cars will be here by society will decide how fast we adopt the technology
223,thing is old cars can be converted into self driving cars relatively easily the big obstacle to self driving cars is solely software im a car person myself and rather enjoy driving but the benefits of self driving cars way outweigh my desire to drive a car myself already in the scenarios self driving cars are capable at self driving cars are far safer than human drivers and their ability to communicate and react perfectly to each other means traffic would be a thing of the past the technology is likely to be ready in less than years id give it years until they makeup the majority of the cars on the road and until human drivers are illegal on public roads
224,i dont understand the downvotes this is true im in the software industry years in software terms is basically we dont have a clue i always immediately jump to edge cases which is of the work the prototype is what people see and get hyped up about thats the thats where we are at today thats what the public sees the public sees the self driving car on the road and think its just around the corner i see the of work related to edge cases what about this scenario and this one and this one and that doesnt even include the second see the rule of software development which is all of the work to take the product to market qa bug fixes patch planning upgrades plans release plans supportability the shit ton of issues that crop up you didnt plan for the massive amount of infrastructure work necessary to run the software outside of the product itself think more like years ive heard automated driving years for years already its always years away
225,thats why i said society will decide how quickly we adopt the technology
226,i never said we wont be able to drive cars that doesnt mean we wont have them do most of the work companies already have technology that can deal with everything you mentioned the issue again like i said is how fast society will decide to adopt the technology
227,i literally said its up to society to decide how fast the technology is adopted
228,the a senior software dev at a top software company i have also been qa for some of the time if anything everyone is vastly underestimating the dates problems and scenarios am i worried self driving cars will remove jobs yes but not for years even if self driving was perfect today it would take years to get reasonable market penetration example the first prius which was crazy popular came out in thats years ago electric cars today make up less than of cars sold self driving will take a similar road map to electric cars as they both add an additional cost to vehicles right now i would argue full self driving cars arent even at the first prius point which really only got like mpg and was pretty weak today at the consumer level we only have glorified cruise control and some cool tech and test vehicles that drive by themselves with humans monitoring them no fully automatic driving at a consumer level the first vehicles to go full ai will be long haul truckers because its the simplest problem to solve freeway only driving we dont have this yet working at a good enough level and this isnt even accounting for the politics of it its way to early to be talking about removing steering wheels
229,why in the world the downvotes candidate for rsoftwaregore
230,the problem with self driving cars is trust im not entirely sure that i trust a self driving car to take me where i tell it to every single time maybe the car decides that ive been to the liquor store or the casino too many times this month maybe the local authorities are quietly routing me around a traffic disruption or maybe theyre deciding what i need to see or not see out my windshield or what protests or political assembly i should attend or avoid sure you have the right to keep and bear arms but the autonomous vehicle network wont take you to the gun store a business paying for seo or outright higher placement on the search is one thing but what happens if mcdonalds pays your automaker for preferential destination placement take me to burger king please hal im sorry dave im afraid i cant do that how about the mcdonalds down the road and thats not even taking things like arrest or abduction into account
231,uploadsonlyusedteslacomwp contentuploadssoftware screen xjpg
232,its still software and software sometimes stops working if you want to put your life into the hands of a car have at it
233,you really think somebody is going to base their entire opinion of the self drive feature on a little part of their website go to a dealership and they will explain to you what its limitations are and how it should be used theyre not tricking buyers about anything also from teslas website autopilot enables your car to steer accelerate and brake automatically within its lane current autopilot features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous what they mean is that these cars have the hardware necessary so that they can be autonomous when the software gets to that point too
234,your getting upset over an advertisement literally go to the autopilot page tesla has and it will tell you exactly what the auto drive is cabable of the order page literally has bullets that tell you what it can do and says driver supervision is required and no the name is full self driving capability you may think its petty but they clarify that it means that it would be capable for full self driving when the software gets to that point
235,how is clearly explaining capabilities and limitations of your product deceptive anybody curious enough to spend minutes can find out what this can do on their own website and yes the car itself is capable of self driving thats the whole point but the software is still being refined why shouldnt they be allowed to market that its telling their customers that once the time comes and tesla is fully autonomous they wont have to upgrade their cars at all this argument is completely stupid because youre clinging on to the wording of one product name that is technically completely correct and completely ignoring how clearly tesla spells out exactly what autopilot can do at the present time
236,do you have any idea how much advancements tesla has made over the past few years they are currently the most advanced self driving car on the public market and are you seriously comparing in city autonomous companies with only a few hundred cars to a company that produces highway legal vehicles and nearing million units you do realize how dumb that argument is right the simple fact is tesla drivers who use autopilot are involved in far less crashes than conventional vehicles i dont know why you assume that full autopilot is going to fail but the way i see things its closer than you think considering they created all of this in less than years tesla isnt being deceptive and driving with autopilot is safer and the software is being constantly improved
237,they almost might become all deadlocked and they still have to reliably detect the potential for a crash and successfully work together theres still a lot of room in there for unexpected changes mechanical failures software glitchesbugsetc my point isnt exactly about what a human driver does but how a self driver car should or should not behave
238,but already if you look at the statistics youll see that driving in specifically teslas autonomous mode is significantly safer then driving as a human and this is very beginning software in the next years it will obviously continue to get even safer and leave human drivers in the dust
239,occasional issues are to be expected with beta software is not an excuse i want to hear from the company that makes the self driving car i put myself and my family in
240,it use to be a joke that if a certain software was a car their would be crashes everywhere now its reality
241,the amount of people commenting on this without actually having any experience driving with the beta software is staggering but also not surprising
242,now imagine boeing doing something like this yes they did that with mcas released it without telling their users most of them anyways but they certainly they dont just roll out software updates without significant testing car crashes can kill people just like airplanes do just not the same number of people at once ota updates are great but they need to be tested tested tested and most likely approved especially if you want the car to do the driving
243,imagine youre riding a motorcycle on a lane road and youre approaching an oncoming model the driver of the model has their head in their lap fiddling with their phone because autopilot and autosteer have the wheel the only thing separating you and lbs of metal glass and lithium with a combined closing speed of mph is that vehicles camera system and software repeatedly detecting yellow paint on the road between you
244,people writing have no clue what teslas validation processes are tesla has very extensive validation processes and the processes are being made more robust each release with more test cases it would be impossible to manage such complex software without extensive validation this case was caught quickly and tesla quickly rolled back the software and they added this case to their validation test suite this is also why they have phased release processes to make sure impact of rare errors is minimized tesla has the most advanced software revision and validation process of any automotive manufacturer
245,i think its worth pointing out that this article is by the washington post which is owned by bezos who is trying to sue spacex and nasa because hes butthurt that he didnt win a big government contract i am a tesla owner but i definitely dont give tesla or especially musk a pass for their shitty behavior including rolling out incomplete fsd software and being anti right to repair but i think this is just a whine fest meant to slight musk the fsd betas have been going surprisingly well there are some hiccups but it is improving rapidly
246,can you get your back if you dont want that busted software
247,what level of hubris do you need to have as a company when you think its acceptable to roll out beta software that pilots a ton vehicle to average joe to be used as an unofficial public test bed most likely not communicating to average joe that its actually only test software
248,why do so many trust tesla when they know despite what system you work with there will be bugs and computer crashes why would tesla software be any different nothing is or ever will be perfect including tesla there will be faults coming from software design software coding software evaluation hardware design hardware faults and human interaction tesla undoubtedly knows all this and upgrading software introduces a level of uncertainty that is well uncertain some may think that the market will correct any problems that may be true but how many people have to get injured or die for that to happen should we let that happen when we ie the people and government might reduce the chance of future incidents the introduction of standard practices that must be followed
249,upon confirming the full self driving rollback musk said occasional issues are to be expected with beta software which is intended to be tested in a variety of conditions to iron out problems nah its cool man its still in beta s apparently costs to be a tester full self driving is the latest iteration of the companys software now in the hands of roughly drivers who paid as much as to upgrade and received early access or passed a safety screening
250,the number of people with this software is equal to one day of teslas vehicle sales the rollback happened within a day this article is old
251,tesla really is just a double edged sword youre getting an electric car that has all of the tech and features you could possibly want in a car you have great software cool design language and decentgreat battery range on the other hand the support and maintenance is a fucking nightmare replacement parts are either expensive as shit or nonexistent software is mostly good but some critical components like self driving arent polished the engineering on some components are way too over engineered for what theyre doing leading to horrible reliability
252,this is what happens when software focused people get exposure to the real world they downplay the severity of the event its easy to laugh off a bad deployment if some service goes down less so when do something that inadvertently injurs or kills someone
253,ive got a bias against self driving specifically because ive been in the software industry for over years when i see products that are constantly being improved for years still having hundreds of new defects annually yeah when applied to self driving that could be a huge amount of deaths
254,there is not faa like verification process which auto manufacturers have to go through to demonstrate the safety and engineering robustness of their software systems and the automotive software today is more complex than the aviation autopilot systems combined with tesla flagrant denial of the predictable abuse issue which we know exists and we have a major problem with safety
255,tesla is a software company just incidental that their software is deployed on machines that drive on public roads and can kill people when things go wrong sadly this is how they are also regulated for the most part
256,autopilot is great most of the time but im shocked at some of the performance issues it still has like after all these years it still gets tripped up and swerves right when im passing a merge lane on the highway every single time surely they could add some logic to keep it pinned to the left lane marker rather than just stupidly centering itself in a car wide space it has maps and knows when its next to an on ramp the nice thing though is that this is software and can be improved over time and released for free seems like a lack of desire the address terrible behavior in basic autopilot though
257,a camera system and software that never gets sleepy or distracted or drunk or thinks about anything else your situation is comical would you rather be on the road with a distracted driver fiddling with their phone without the autopilot cause thats what we have on the roads today
258,and besides its not like it worked very well to begin with this video was taken last year after they released the newest version that musk claimed was full self driving case number of not understanding which software does what on a tesla its literally about blaming software that isnt even installed in the car thats what the narrative is now
259,yes their validation procedures are so good they developed tested validated and distributed their software just to roll it back the same day a critical error you find hours after release must not be overlooked on the validation phase before very thrust worthy
260,most likely not communicating to average joe that its actually only test software it literally tells you it is in testing and that you the driver must maintain control at all times
261,even if youre correct that they all have full complete control which is doubtful tesla is testing beta software on public roads that means everybody on those public roads is a beta tester whether they know it or not to my knowledge other car manufacturers arent allow to do this
262,safety critical systems shouldnt be beta tested on the public at all let alone having your customers pay for the privilege of assuming that risk never mind that software this buggy shouldnt have even made it out of integration testing
263,highway driving is handled by a separate software stack that isnt the fsd beta its the original software stack that all cars ha e
264,this is nonsense do you freak out when someone is using cruise control do you even understand how the fsd works it requires the driver to pay attention with their hands touching the wheel at all times private beta means only a select group of people are allowed to use it how the hell are you supposed to test self driving feature on a private road the software issue was fixed the same day this entire story is a nothingburger
265,tesla sent invitations to some drivers for its new experimental driver assistance software dubbed full self driving beta which includes early access to features like autosteer on city streets to get access to fsd beta in general drivers must own tesla vehicles with newer hardware and must purchase or subscribe to the premium fsd package which costs up front in the us or a month sounds private to me invitation only and must have already purchased the premium fsd package edit formatting
266,company has k out of its million cars beta testing software you have to opt into the program and have to be a proven safe driver there was a bug in the software and it was corrected within min
267,they want the cars to drive by themselves the company is assuring us that the software is safe and they shouldnt need to have any outside testing done on it were supposed to just allow them to download updates which may or may not release the cars upon our roadways like a menace the company says its safe and that were supposed to trust them when the cars suddenly start slamming on the breaks in the middle of the highway they just say oops that was a bad update the company doesnt want any oversight or regulation about this they want to be able to test and then implement anything they want without any supervision or input from anyone its crazy to allow them to do this
268,a camera system and software that never gets sleepy or distracted or drunk or thinks about anything else the article details extensively issues that their autopilots have been having with their most recent beta release
269,i had phantom breaking also on my toyota chr no one wrote any article about it or had any software update to fix it
270,move fast and break things may work for facebook but you dont really want that in your automative software
271,theyre not wrong the easiest way to progress quickly is to move fast and break things thats fine when you accidentally break peoples access for a few hours to large scale knowledge database that has only existed for the last years or so thats not fine when the things you are breaking are users bones bodies and lives tesla takes the attitude of software design sometimes all that said tesla actually does a lot of heavy testing and checks the problem of being at the edge is that theres edge cases that only happen of the time and its really hard to fix remember when toyotas modification of accelerators and mats resulted in a huge amount of accidents to pay million in crash settlement mats still to blame it took over years since the issue was identified and toyota would still deny the obvious teslas engineering is top notch and their cars have had less security issues and better fixes than their competitors throughout the years blame the culture and management but the engineering is top notch human and sometimes making mistakes but as good quality as any other car maker as a matter of fact that will be the problem that self driving cars will have there will be errors and failures that will result in deaths but even if self driving cars do only slightly better than the average youd have to go to tens of thousands of deaths before it wouldnt still be a better idea than not doing it but people dont see it like that its the airplane fallacy someone would rather go drive cross country out of fear of dying on an airplane crash when in reality the moment they have the highest chance of dying on a flight is on the drive to and back from the airport a cross country trip is incredibly dangerous in comparison but because seeing someone die being run over or due to a car crash is an every day occurrence no one really talks about and we dont think but airplane crashes are so rare we obsess over them the safer car gets the more national news a car crash will be in this specific case though musk shot himself on the foot imho had he been less combative this wouldnt have escalated into an issue that is national news the tech is not at a point thats ready to ask for regulation revisits and offering more freedom on it while it may be mature enough that this would be beneficial we really dont have enough data even if tesla is doing it right its not easy to imagine what regulations must be set someone else could come with their cheap version that screws everyone and sets back the regulatory evolution of self driving cars a decade there is such a thing as too soon
272,have you any actual experience with tesla design regardless of their software bugs which are much less than many other vehicles hyundai im looking at you the tesla is designed much better than any other vehicle ive ever disassembled
273,reason you have to pay attention is the self driving relies on a computer algorithm based on reinforcement learning the more data they can collect the better it will become but they have to collect that data somehow its like the idea of learning algebra if you came from an understanding of basic math learning algebra isnt too hard but if youre trying to jump from elementary school math straight into algebra youre going to be lost right now theyre trying to teach something that has never understood driving to drive so you can think of the people using the software as teachers and the more time they put into learning the better it can be but without them the right at which itll improve will be dramatically slower so in order for this sort of technology to take off and to be safe it requires a lot of training because how can it expect something like a pedestrian jumping into the road or an animal darting across or even another car swerving in front of you these are all very rare situations that may never happen to most people
274,apples to apples this would be like boeing installing some software they tested in simulated hardware into beta planes out of airplanes in service and then when they noticed the beta planes were braking erroneously during pre flight checks and they were getting altitude warnings while still on the ground they rolled the software on the beta planes back to the previous version this is what caused the rollback to occur on the beta tesla vehicles false collision warnings and unnecessary auto emergency braking events might occur translated out if a beta car had someone tailgating at speed and there was a false collision warning then there might be an emergency braking event and that might lead to an accident due to the human driver following closer than is safe not quite the headline news event is it
275,this beta gets rolled out to users who are selected for being specifically responsible while operating the car in auto pilot mode that must opt in and sign a waiver acknowledging that its beta software and they need to be extra careful while assisting with the test i still agree it should be regulated but this isnt like they roll it out to every single car at the same time
276,youre correct they have to beta test the software before its rolled out tesla beta tested this software saw feedback from the beta test that there were false collision warnings even a couple is plenty and because that could lead to unwanted emergency braking they had to roll back the beta tester cars to a stable release the headline should read tesla doing a good job of playing it safe with beta testing vehicles
277,i dont understand how fsd can be a public beta the drivers may consent to using beta software but i sure dont consent to being on the road next to beta software that needs to be tested with professional drivers who are aware of the systems limitations
278,human uses vision to make driving decisions and leads to deaths a year perfect system robot uses vision to make driving decisions and leads to zero deaths ever omg what if a random driving edge case is later to be tackled by software shut the whole thing down
279,do other car manufacturers have their software tested by regulators what exactly did you see coming was there a crash
280,did you sign up for teslas beta test youre not listening just persistent in seeing this from one view this is about public safety first technological progress has always required breaking a few eggs if you want to make an omelet this is such a sociopathic statement those broken eggs are human beings do you know how many inhumane scientific experiments have been conducted with this inhumane justification even if we as a society decide to embark on this journey its not at teslas sole discretion
281,the article is a hodge podge of vague references to incidents not actually related to the fsd software at all but to other and older systems in the case that triggered the article it was a power management system that shut down one of the two fsd cpus and the fsd software did what it could to mitigate the situation tesla needs to get better at testing but unfortunately the accepted narrative is to treat all those separate systems as one big black box and boil it down to fsd is bad
282,the article discusses a version of software that was live from about am to am for about thousand people one sunday morning before being rolled back i was one of those people and drove for about miles during that time and had no issues yes its a problem when any vehicle drives unsafely but we dont know what of the k were affected only that some users reported issues this was also software labeled as beta that users had to go through up to a month of proving they were safe drivers to gain access to and had to sign off on the potential risks and are being monitored for attentiveness by the internal cabin camera they kick you out of the program if you are not looking at the road i really dont know how much more safely you can develop such a program
283,theres a middle ground between no real world testing and releasing it to the public obviously these things need to be tested in the real world but having the public at large handle it seems like the worst option tesla has the capital to run millions of hours of driving time using internal testers im sure theyve done a lot of that and are continuously doing that it just seems like their internal testing falls short regulations would at least let a third party set some standards as to the minimum amount of testing and objectives that need to be met before you let the customers get unfinished and potentially buggy software
284,full self driving is the latest iteration of the companys software now in the hands of roughly drivers who paid as much as to upgrade and received early access or passed a safety screening is small want them driving through your kids school zone
285,thats simply not true if you sell your car privately fsd and any other software packages you have are carried over to the next owner edit amazing that im downvoted for telling the truth must be some bots in this thread proof full self driving fsd transfer when you sell a tesla
286,most people who die in car accidents are either breaking laws or the victims of people who have broken laws i dont think its an acceptable standard to decide that as long as robots do about as well as or somewhat better than humans at driving that everything is cool since that also includes all the humans who have died because they were doing something that we have made illegal like speeding distracted driving drunk driving etc the benchmark we use should not be how well does autonomous driving do against the sum total of all humans it should be how well does autonomous driving do against all the humans killed in accidents where they were not speeding not drunk not texting and not sleepy and actually a robot has killed a person yeah it was stupid and yeah youll think its bullshit but there really was a person who was run over by a car when they were walking with their bike at night there have been more cases of people killed by ignoring instructions to keep their hands on a wheel and then self driving cars would fail to see semis in front of them its only zero ever if you decide to ignore fatalities that have happened with people who ignored instructions to keep their hands on the wheel but theres a difference between the duty of an engineering team to design something that is hard to misuse and the realities of people who get distracted teslas team of engineers could have made it impossible to use self driving in unsafe ways if they wanted to but instead a person fell asleep with autopilot on and got decapitated by a semi thats an annoying inconvenience to address but its still there
287,i dont agree that haywire or calamity as another on this thread called it is remotely appropriate if you imagine a perfect drive buggy software seems imperfect but humans dont have perfect drives die every year in the us alone add to that the number of injured and the billions in financial damages and you have the true real world baseline for current driving so does a beta software released to s of specifically safe drivers all of whom have been told that the software will likely make bad choices at the worst time qualify as going haywire when it randomly hits the brakes hell no the user can take control instantly the user is supposed to be paying attention they are holding the wheel they are warned in advance the user is selected from a small group of humans specifically based on their ability to consistently drive safe predictably and smooth the situation is far less dangerous than a squirrel running across the road in front of a regular driver is a squirrel crossing the road in front of a car indicative of a super dangerous situation would you have told your friends your drive went haywire on the way home if that happened of course not you probably wouldnt have told anyone because its not newsworthy just like this whole post
288,no thats not how software works private means only a small select group of people have it youre making a huge deal out of nothing
289,working as intended amirite utm_sourceshareutm_mediummwebx imagine defending texting and driving with this software active as youre defending
290,early and safe are inherently contradictory when talking about software in order for it to be considered safe it needs to be thoroughly and rigorously tested data collected and analyzed since the only information i have about their process right now is that they themselves consider this software early and they are rolling back this update because it was causing safety issues it was ipso facto not tested thoroughly enough at least giving them the benefit of the doubt that they did not intentionally release unsafe software either way it is very clear that they do not have any data to prove that this software is safer than a human driver
291,its early release software that is currently being rolled back because it was causing cars to go haywire its not safer than a human driver you can make the argument that computers have the potential to be safer drivers than humans due to reaction times or whatever but that doesnt automatically mean any software you write to drive a car automatically is good and safe the software needs to be meticulously engineered and rigorously tested not rolled out like a shitty early access video game and set loose on public roads
292,every other manufacturer tests their vehicles in a wide range of situations with their own staff behind the wheel and their own liability no reason tesla shouldnt do the same in validating their software
293,nothing about this requires a certification in automotive safety its click bait tesla did a beta test to a controlled group of cars and instantly reverted the software when they werent happy with user reports of invalid collision warnings the actual facts make this story a positive for tesla it shows they arent taking risks inside their beta program
294,i remember seeing this data years ago too specifically they were comparing the data before and after the model s gained the auto pilot features in like or so the accident rate on free ways halfed itself in one year for the model s just from the rollout thats now year old software
295,cool i hope that holds up for them in court if their software kills people
296,such that no one was ever injuredkilled probably very few incidents happen but that doesnt mean products like space heaters washing machines train engines and whatnot werent initially tested as much as possible inside a lab before deploying them on a large scale im not arguing vs having a couple of beta testers on the roads with safety glasses on here im arguing regular consumers shouldnt be enrolled in self driving software betas without being employed in some way by the company to do so and having done some specific safety training like if this was the new call of duty beta on the road want to test these cars hire some damn qa people to do so in simulations then in private roads and then on public roads and keep doing that until you dont consider that a beta at all at that point some incidents may yet happen and that is okay no tech is perfect
297,imagine thinking that was the build they didnt immediately disable and issue a fix quickly that was used on a small subset of the cars on the road with people who know the risks of using this advanced beta and theyll kick you out of it if you use your phone often while trying to use the software the production software i had did what i claimed not this small group maybe of their cars did before being fixed quickly
298,its early release software that is currently being rolled back because it was causing cars to go haywire did you even read the article this happened weeks ago and it only lasted a couple of hours before the problem was solved
299,buying a used car from a dealership who bought from tesla who bought from a person is very different from buying a used car from a person directly thats why i specifically mentioned if you sell your car privately fsd and any other software packages you have are carried over to the next owner if tesla themselves are the next owner they can do anything with the car and remove fsd if they want but if they remove fsd and try to resell it theyll struggle to compete with used car dealerships and private party sales so they would probably avoid doing that
300,cars kill people per year already if this software has a chance to decrease that youd have to be a sociopath to stop or significantly delay work on it if they were rolling things out to millions of people without communicating it or not explaining how to use it to the drivers or not fixing errors quickly sure but none of that is happening the world is literally dying from climate change and our government is in the middle of ignoring a coup we have real problems to care about why invent non problem problems
301,i want to really sit down and chat with the guy who answers the former instead of the latter i dont like the way tesla is treating the idea of putting full on self driving cars out there as if its some cute little windows update for people to try on but what matters more than anything is the actual impact this has on human lives straight up if self driving overall reduces the number of vehicular fatalities and injuries even if it causes accidents where otherwise there objectively would not have been one it is a net positive and i fully encourage putting it out there in the safest way possible its hard to get over the mental flip out with the thought that maybe the robo brain in someones car decides to swerve for no reason and kills an innocent pedestrian but we dont react with the same blanket damnation over human driving when some drunk or tired driver goes careening into someones house and crushes someone whos sleeping in their bed the objective analysis needs to be the deciding factor self driving can be improved human error is much harder to govern but at the same time that also doesnt excuse a high error rate from fsd it will get better cant be an excuse if theres a net negative today
302,im not against evs renewables self driving or climate change actions what i am against is when a company purposefully obfuscates and hides data from a beta program that i am involved in but did not consent to we can aim to improve evs and self driving without gargling elons cock if a company is going to be testing self driving vehicles on public roads then all their test data should be publicly available and they should be able to be held accountable if a fluke in the software ends up killing someone
303,youre missing the point the car filmed doesnt have any fsd software installed nothing zero the attempt at linking anything that elon said about fsd to that car is invalid
304,thats as inaccurate as the us claiming there were wmd on iraq please show sources if your correct if you look at the body work you can tell its clearly a model that is installed with everything you claim it doesnt have it would have full software full hardware and it would have been fully updated as any test of its systems would be fully considered by tesla engineers so this wouldnt happen are you being paid by them they have lots of pr contractors in the social media space
305,article didnt give much away does anyone know what sort of stuff is being decided on
306,i feel companies just wouldnt be down to accept responsibility things still break no matter how well designed they are and we still see a bunch of recalls in this day and age add the complexity of the software also bugging too and things can still go wrong and that is a lot of liability for the company to have
307,cops will be irrelevant car just drives you straight to jail instead you spend the whole time freaking out what was it this time defaulted on your mortgage and the bank is taking your kidneys or maybe you missed a traffic ticket and they decided to remove you from circulation its not your fault you cant afford software update and your permarental took a suboptemized traffic route and caused a few milliseconds delay to someone elses commute every second that passes you feel a scream rising in your throat you press the door button but it refuses to respond the bulletproof windows of the tesla permarental designed to protect you from gang violence keeping you from throwing yourself into the road you desperately wish you had bought the standard package so you would have an actual key and not a remote start button just so you could slit your own throat with it the world passes by completely unaware of your growing terror the walls of the car begin to close in as your future as a test subject for a pharmaceutical as a more ethical replacement to animals becomes clear to you its ironic really you protested animal testing in college you see the jail now the drive in beckons as your car makes the final adjustment and prepares to leave you to your fate your phone vibrates the uber bailbondtm app is offering to bail you for ten thousand plus adjusted course mileage surcharge you agree but you only have three hundred bucks left after your apple ieye needed to be replaced last month due to manufacturers fault you open up the dao loan exchange and apply opting for twenty thousand to cover conversions and tumbling to ensure you dont end up with tainted currency the smart contract sits uncompleted as your journey comes to its end your life flashes before your eyes as the money is approved and your account emptied to secure your freedom minus twenty dollar first time credit of course by the time your mostly uneventful life has been played to you the car is almost at its original destination you get out of the car and make your way inside the featureless dormitory you reside in its three foot efficiency elevator depositing you at your tiny quarters you strip off your clothes as the door slides shut behind you the chill of the room biting at you as you do youd have a shower but its been broken for months a slow dripping that fills your meager dwelling with mold and rot the arbitration clause and abdication of rights agreement leaving you without recourse with the corporation that runs the facility you climb into bed the sewn rags you call a blanket wet with moisture that only serves to further your discomfort your ieye playing videos of the latest apple appliances and updating you on the latest celebrity news sleep is fleeting and dreams are corrupted by commercials all that is certain to you is that you will awake into the world and hope your job hasnt been replaced by a machine ok im done

309,good point many people dont have the vaguest idea how reliable specifically designed hardware and embedded software are they think its going to be as reliable as their home pc when its much closer to being as reliable as a hand held calculator i doubt any of us even know someone who had a hand held calculator ever return the wrong value
310,that flawcode is corrected and the update is rolled out so that accident never happens again a programmer will probably tell you that fixing bugs in complex systems is more of an art than a science though im pretty excited at the prospects of unit testing for these kinds of things conceivably the sensor readouts prior to every accident can be perfectly recorded and used as a test data for future updates whereby the software must make the correct decision when faced with the known crash conditions before its allowed to be deployed
311,for all autonomous cars are fantastic i dont see it happening any time soon and mostly for the reasons around morality the question is not if the question is when does the car protect the driver in all instances or a pedestrian does the car preference an older person over a younger one does the car preference a pregnant woman or a couple there will be situations where death of someone is nearly assured and what the car decides will be out of the hands of anyone involved in the crash and likely the systems and its inbuilt morality will be based on the morals of a different country likely the us or japan regulation is also an absolute nightmare and i find it really surprising that we are so convinced by self driving cars when self driving trains are still not the norm whos liable is just a fraction of these huge issues
312,easily the manufacturer will insure the car and you will pay monthly subscription fees to use it it stops becoming owned and you will use the car as a service as we do it more and more with software insurance companies can stop caring about everyday users and only do business with companies which is way easier and more lucrative anyway
313,its pretty easy actually all items that are sold in this country need to pass a certain certification standard you simply write into the lawstandard what a car must be capable of doing to be fit for sale you simply regulate what is required of an automated car like all cars the vehicle must pass an mot this could also include software updates that comply with the standards therefore the company is responsible for the safety of these features while the user is responsible for ensuring the vehicle meets the standard agreed upon
314,i think you are on the money with this comment there is no need for a company like toyota to pay a much smaller insurance company to take risk off its books there will be a place for re insurance i expect in the event of large scale issues imagine a large class action lawsuit due to a software glitch in the us
315,there will be a place for re insurance i expect in the event of large scale issues imagine a large class action lawsuit due to a software glitch in the us i doubt anyone would be willing to insure them for that though anything that would be too costly for toyota to bear would also be too big for an insurer to bear and the risk of that occurring would be unquantifiable
316,i see the insurance cost being carried by the car manufacturer if a car is self driving and i have no input why would i carry a liability insurance policy if my only decision is to go from point a to point b then i shouldnt have any liability for any accidents caused by car software etc and shouldnt have to pay for a policy of course the government is the government and theyll be pushed by insurance company lobbyists to still require that car owners hold liability insurance i figure itll take a few decades before people start realizing that nobodys personal liability insurance paid out in a long time and shouldnt be required either that or the rates will be so low that it just wont matter
317,and it is precisely those collision statistics mortality charts and actuarial tables that decide the premiumsdeductibles as the total number of collisions go down but rate of human caused collisions still remains the same the expected payout per contract per year goes down as expected payout goes down ethics boards and regulations will push premiums and deductibles down but only for autonomous vehicles vehicles piloted by humans and their insurance plans will have a smaller pool as the ubiquity of avs grows which skyrockets the coefficient of variation since median grows like on and standard deviation grows with osqrtn associated with insuring non avs this adds a lot of risk to insurance companies making the feasibility of insuring human drivers go down so youll get a few outcomes insurance companies refusing to insure human drivers massive premiumsdeductibles when they do insure humans and a market pressure to buyreplace non avs with avs whenever a write off takes place also eventually well get a generation of teenagers whose parents refuse to pay the cost of insuring young drivers that is a generation in which a growing incidence never get behind a wheel and have always only known autonomous vehicles
318,its hard to see it ending up any other way at least for fully autonomous cars however when they actually start selling these cars to consumers there are likely to be some catches they havent mentioned yet first if you have a car with a full manual mode ie one where the human is in ultimate control and wont be overridden your obviously not going to be covered by the manufacturer when your in that mode during the transition back to computer driving you also wont be covered for some amount of time to make sure that you didnt put the computer in a situation it cant recover from as a result of your manual control the second major limitation is that there will be strict maintenance requirements possibly even a maintenance contract that you pay in advance and the car will go get itself fixed by an authorized manufacturer approved mechanic likely at a dealership when it decides it needs something fixed even if there is no contract failure to get a problem fixed going to an unapproved mechanic or fixing something yourself may all suspend the manufacturers automatic assumption of liability they may still be liable but they will want the chance to investigate and if necessary disclaim liability it the accident was really the fault of poor repair work unapproved modifications will likewise void coverage
319,the second major limitation is that there will be strict maintenance requirements possibly even a maintenance contract that you pay in advance and the car will go get itself fixed by an authorized manufacturer approved mechanic likely at a dealership when it decides it needs something fixed which is a really good thing for all the other people that have to share the road with people who dont bother keeping up on maintenance
320,yeah the car parts of the car wont change much at least vs existing hybrid cars i wouldnt trust johnnys fix a flat to mess with the electronics that decide when not to run over children
321,that would be such a definitive advantage when trying to sell a sdc that i cant see how any other car manufacturer would decide to do it differently it would be like buying a new car without abs today even if the law would allow it
322,theyre not going to come to your defence no thats what insurance is for its just a matter of which company has your back i know countless people that have had wrecks none with appropriate insurance have ever suffered any real financial liability i do know some that have suffered criminal liability for doing something stupid but that is affected by who assumes responsibility for insuring the vehicle and lets be honest even if it is you footing the insurance if your car was the one driving if its coming to a lawsuit as opposed to just damages which are routinely handled by insurance its the software and hardware makers theyre going to be going after regardless as theyre the ones with money and unless you did something wrong theyre obviously the ones at fault if such a thing exists its important to remember not every accident has to have somebody at fault bad shit happens sometimes and if you are somehow actually at fault say for not properly maintaining the vehicle then of course theyre going to go after you again whether the vehicle is insured through the manufacturer or not in fact youll probably have the manufacturer after your hide now too look im not saying im opposed to manufacturers self insuring or even that it wont prove to be a somewhat better choice im just saying people get way too worked up about it and its not that big a deal the vehicles will be insured and if end users have to write the check themselves no big deal remember youre paying for it one way or another directly or indirectly there are even advantages to doing it yourself particularly if you have to have insurance for when you self drive anyway you get to shop based on price and service you can choose a plan commensurate with the amount of risk youre willing to accept you can change insurance companies if youre unhappy etc at any rate its not some massive problem thats impossible to solve and will be impossible to solve and cause problems with adoption of sdcs as some people seem to think its a relatively minor procedural decision with multiple reasonable solutions
323,youre damn right this supposed dilemma has no relevance to anyone making an sdc in real life youd think anyone who has been driving a car for years without having to make a similar decision would understand this right away but its still every armchair pundits favourite talking point especially if you meet someone socially and you tell them you work on sdcs but this isnt even the trolley problem the original form of the trolley problem is that you have to choose between letting the trolley kill n people but its not your fault or switching tracks so it will kill person but you did it at its heart its a question about acts of commission vs omission blame and liability and its been the core of the auto industrys approach to driver assist for at least the last years probably longer the corresponding dilemma for the auto industry is this say you have a new emergency braking system that prevents some percentage of fatal accidents so if you deployed it in all new cars it would save x lives per year but its not a perfect system so sometimes it might brake or swerve unnecessarily costing y lives per year but the x deaths that happen if you do nothing are not your fault or as the legal system works youre not liable for them whereas the y deaths that might happen would definitely leave the manufacturer liable in a perfect world maybe the choice of whether to ship the system would be whether x y maybe youd take into account some other factors like it would make people drive more recklessly endangering more lives that you hadnt accounted for or the deaths caused by the system are more or less traumatic for drivers that could be an interesting moral discussion but the auto industrys solution to this is that you only ship the system if y theyre quite happy for drivers to kill any number of people with their cars so long as the manufacturer isnt liable the number one phrase used by people who write safety critical software for the legacy auto industry is but what if it makes it crash into a bus full of lawyers children thats why the first aeb systems only started braking after the driver did and its why the idea of robotaxis where theres no driver to shift liability to is so disruptive to the industry its still not very relevant to anyones day to day work as an sdc engineer but the trolley problem well a legalistic reading of it is key to the formation of the sdc industry
324,the problem with adding ai to collision avoidance is that it puts the liability on the auto manufacturer once the manufacturer starts putting in code to recognize certain objects eg humans vs cars then it could be argued that the automaker is responsible for pedestrian deaths for that reason you may not see such a sophisticated avoidance system until it is mandated by the government and the government sets the guidelines for priority of avoidance then automakers will be able to say in court our software swerved out of the way of the oncoming wheeler and hit the pedestrian because according to government guidelines thats how its supposed to work until such time collision avoidance will work on avoiding the closest object to the front bumper and if it swerves to avoid something and ends up hitting something else theres no intelligence behind it to say it was a wrong choice to swerve
325,there are other ethical situations where the pedestrian isnt at fault what if a car coming the opposite way swerves right in front of you at the last second your self driving car can brake all it wants but it may have to swerve in order to avoid the collision now what if there are pedestrians on the sidewalk of the road what would probably happen in that situation is that the car will allow the collision to happen since cars are designed for hitting each other and there would be nothing to protect swerving into the pedestrians that seems like the logical choice but there is another argument to be made too should the car protect the driver at all costs the driver is surrendering themselves and giving all trust and control in this car would it be ethical for it to allow the driver to be hurt over other people who arent involved with the car the reason people are talking about these hypothetical situations is because they will have to be decided before the situation becomes a reality these conditions will have to be explicitly set in the rules logic this isnt an area where we can say well see what happens these kind of decisions will have to be explicitly laid out and i think thats what people get hung up on a programmer will have to sit down and make the decision let my driver get hurt let the other driver get hurt let the bystanders get hurt an irobot model can even be applied where collision avoidance is based on a statistical survival model
326,and it makes an issue of a non issue if self driving cars make fewer mistakes over all than human drivers then we side with the better system so what if they cant make moral decisions morality isnt part of driving not hitting things is i dont need a car that weighs the life of a child as more important than the lives of everyone in two cars i need a car that doesnt swerve me into oncoming traffic every time some human decides to throw themselves in front of it not throwing themselves in front of oncoming cars should be something everyone understands expecting cars to make moral calculations regarding the relative value of life based on years lived is insane
327,years ago i took a shortcut through a residential neighborhood id never driven down those streets before but assumed they could lead me through to the next main road that i was seeking inherently i understood there was an additional risk of children playing and kind of mentally weighed the risk against my time saving benefit i was at or below the speed limit since i was having to wind my way about and as i had said i was not familiar with my path each turn was an arbitrary gamble then i saw a tiny glint of white from under a parked car i had zero clue what i saw but my mind did a natural calculation of trajectory and predicted an eminent collision i dont remember hitting my breaks but i locked all four wheels before the days of abs as i stood there at a standstill my heart sank into the pit of my stomach as a little blond haired girl continued her walk into the street this toddler was barely over bumper height and if not for the fact that her mom dressed her in white shoes that morning she most certainly would have met her fate ive thought times over what made me slam on my brakes that day and my only answer is that i felt i had to with every fiber of my being for all those who are involved in the decision making abilities of these automated systems i can only hope they will find the algorithm for gut feelings
328,the reason people are talking about these hypothetical situations is because they will have to be decided before the situation becomes a reality none of the situations you described are unique to sdcs there are already laws governing such actions the only difference is that people are uncomfortable with the consequences of those laws being so clearly demonstrated by being coded into a car if a car does what is legally expected then there is no issue i dont think the situations are as complicated as people make them out to be these cars will have a much greater situation awareness than any human if something unexpected enough happens that causes a crash then you can hardly blame the sdc the cars core logic doesnt have to be any more complicated than swerve if a reasonable open area is available otherwise break so for instance if the car detected a cliff to one side or pedestrians or an oncoming vehicle in its potential escape path it would just break there simply arent a lot of good options if a car swerves into your path a human wouldnt have the reaction time to do anything anyway at least with a sdc you have a chance
329,interesting i did not know that still it should be a non issue from the link you provided however on appeal the court ruled that the jury should be able to decide whether based on the facts and circumstances of this case and the characteristics of this child ted could be held to have been negligent the child stepping out in front of the car should have automatically caused the car to brake faster than any human could all of which would have been recorded id say that that should be enough mitigating circumstances to avoid fault however this brings up another important point none of this is unique to sdcs the legal system has already developed laws and rules for dealing with these cases presumably these laws and rules are considered the right thing to do in such circumstances and automated cars will be able to carry out that expected behavior better than any human could the only issue i can see is when the law makes a distinction between the correct action based on some criteria that a sdc cant determine for instance if the law was to say that you should crash your car into another car if it was a child in the way but hit the pedestrian if they were an adult then that would cause a problem if the car could not determine the age of the pedestrian im no lawyer but i have a hard time believing such an interpretation of the law would be correct regardless of the childs tort liability there has to be a presumptive defense that a driver doesnt have to endanger their life by getting into a head on crash in order to protect a child
330,agreed which is why i say the problem isnt with the sdcs making the decision but with humans being explicitly forced to deal with the issues because we have to program the sdcs ahead of time its emotionally easier for us to pretend that such situations dont happen and then write to whole thing off as an unfortunate accident when they do happen it is the premeditation inherit in programming sdcs software that trips people up
331,ive always said that even if self driving cars arent perfect we have to consider the net effect consider the situation where sdcs roll out and save ten thousand lives in the first year but due to bugs in the software they also kill one hundred people people will freak out over the hundred deaths and ignore the thousands of saved lives
332,minimizing legal liability is what we as a society have decided is the right thing to do you also have to remember the context in which im making these statements buffet said that these types of situations would be a hinderance to sdc adoption im saying they wont because we as a society have already decided what the solution should be these situations are not unique to sdcs in addition simply breaking with a perception and reaction time greater than any human is a perfectly acceptable solution no sdc is going to get in trouble with the law for not swerving into oncoming traffic also no emergency driver assistance system on a car today would even think about swerving and nobody bats an eye if anything would be a hinderance to sdc adoption it would be if people knew that their car was designed to crash into oncoming traffic for the benefit of someone else so i say again the solution is simple the car should break as hard as it can and hit the child there is no legal problem with doing that and that policy isnt going to spook potential ownerspassengers of the car
333,copied response below from another reply ill also add that you arent under any responsibility to injure yourself to help someone else even more importantly you definitely shouldnt injure an innocent third party to protect someone else we wont program these cars to be heros well program them for the minimum legal liability and greatest passenger safety minimizing legal liability is what we as a society have decided is the right thing to do you also have to remember the context in which im making these statements buffet said that these types of situations would be a hinderance to sdc adoption im saying they wont because we as a society have already decided what the solution should be these situations are not unique to sdcs in addition simply breaking with a perception and reaction time greater than any human is a perfectly acceptable solution no sdc is going to get in trouble with the law for not swerving into oncoming traffic also no emergency driver assistance system on a car today would even think about swerving and nobody bats an eye if anything would be a hinderance to sdc adoption it would be if people knew that their car was designed to crash into oncoming traffic for the benefit of someone else so i say again the solution is simple the car should break as hard as it can and hit the child there is no legal problem with doing that and that policy isnt going to spook potential ownerspassengers of the car
334,youre misunderstanding the computer science definition of low level lowest level software is hard wired straight into the microchips software that you can install and update are considered higher level because the low level software allows them to work the main difference is low level software can run much faster than high level software if youre familiar with bitcoin bitcoin mining got way faster when chips called asics were purpose made for mining bitcoin sdcs will likely come with chips purpose made for identifying surroundings so that it happens as quickly as possible
335,what are you on about if theyre on a dedicated chip it allows them to run much faster than if its in software and frees up processor cycles to perform more complex calculations on other things win win
336,everyone else is right low level means closer to the transistor high level would be something like the software object that represents a person high level software runs on general purpose computers but you can always implement that software in specialized hardware specialized hardware is usually less expensive than general purpose hardware and runs the specialized application faster he was saying that some of the algorithms that are running on expensive general purpose computers today will likely be put onto specialized hardware moved to a lower level which will make them run faster and be less expensive than the high level implementation he was in no way implying that the quality would be lower you are the only person here with that interpretation
337,waymo is ahead because google wanted to do this over years ago they have had it on their mind as they build all their other stuff so today google has more data of the physical world than anyone else that they can leverage they know when there is an accident with waze they know when there is a traffic jam they can see the traffic light patterns and when the pattern changes they can see the data where there is a stop sign or even a stop sign has been removed waymo is using a database the cars drive from so if the database indicates a stop sign they stop they do not have to see the stop sign but if the database indicates a stop sign and there is non that they see they create an exception that is logged and the situation is looked into but google can also verify what is happening by using the human driver behavior that they get through google maps and google waze they know if a protest closes a road in real time if a parade they even know how busy a store is at a particular time they know when the stores open and close google has built up their data in prepartion for the data for self driving car robot taxi service and having far better utilization than anyone else but not just the data google has the infrastructure to support you need the ability to handle lots of data coming in make sense of it and get events to cars in real time sound familiar ultimately self driving cars is a software engineering problem google attracts the top engineers in the world so they basically get more first round draft choices than anyone once the cream of the crop comes in and is hire they then can take the cream of the crop of the cream of the crop and send them to waymo google created a virtual california that they can inject diffrent situations this is just vital for doing automated testing i have zero clue how gmforduber and the others are doing this i suspect they just are not why i cant see them getting to a safe solution you are making software and model changes you need to be sure that your change is not breaking something else you need to be able to first do virtual testing there is just so many other factors that favor googlewaymo than just being the only ones that have it working without safety drivers google has b in the bank for example with less than b debt they could buy gm and have plenty left over if they wanted to the piece googlewaymo is missing and nobody has is the car durability data today taxi companies buy regular cars they are not optimized for using as a taxi waymo will now collect data like there has never been before on the cars and that data will drive improvement in durability well beyond cars of today that will enable them to drive down the cost of self driving cars robot taxi service to be cheaper than using your own car within years ultimately waymo will use that data to build cars as it will ultimately be a competitive advantage but they should buy cars until they get the data gathered and then they should buy car making expertise and not do it organically then there is an entirely different angles that google has advantageous that nobody is close at having right now of the top apps used on all smart phones are owned by google enwikipediaorgwikilist_of_most_popular_smartphone_apps gm ford honda combined do not have a single one so there is discovery to summon a car google is unmatched in this area no other company close so you type car into search and a car shows up or you add a calendar event and you get a pop up do you need a car you write an email to get dinner with a friend next week and you both get a pop up do you need a car i saw a stat recently that new email accounts today are more than going to gmail they now have over billion active accounts but it is not only on your phone google in the smart speaker space has moved ahead of amazon even thought getting to the market years later move over amazon echo google home now sits upon the smart speaker throne home most popular speaker so you with google you can just be in your house and say car now and a car shows up gmfordhonda do not have smart speakers honestly never understood how any of this could be debated it is not like it is close now i am someone that does not believe people will be buying self driving cars does not make any sense to me that is people thinking the old world i also do not believe level will happen for decades and possibly not in my life time we have no idea how to do it it will not be as safe as level but there is probably not the financial benefits to spend the billions to do level ultimately it comes down to money we have no idea the processing power that would be required to do level it might be we are a long way from having the silicon to support i think it is far more likely level rolled out like you would roll out cell service area by area with the ones that make you the most money first with self driving cars it will also be driven by government regulation you can get to coverage in probably the next years with level you will then connect city to city so you do phoenix and do tuscon and then you do the highways inbetween eventually you are covering most of the us btw the confusion with level is caused by musk he is way smarter than i and knows better he says things that are simply ridiculous then people believe them the one i find most funny is having the hardware to do level we do not have the algorithms to do level so the idea of having the silicon to support is absurd how can you know that if we do not have algorithms
338,to put all this more concisely they are ahead for a couple reasons they started earlier than everyone else by a long margin they have probably the best infrastructure in the world theyve likely spent more money on talent in this space than anyone else they have the largest collection of top quality software engineers in the world at base google not just waymo they can leverage existing servicesdata like google photos to build classifiers
339,alphabetgooglewaymo has the vast majority of the self driving patents but to this day google has never charged a penny for the use of any of their ip not a single penny they get patents so nobody else does but not to use them as a weapon that is more microsoft mo so for example ms gets paid over for every android phone sold with patent royalties versus it is google ip and they do not charge a cent why microsoft makes to from every android device sold now with that said there is only one time that googlewaymo has even tried to protect ip and that was the suit with uber over the theft of trade secrets and believe patent infringement or something similar was involved plus google shared almost all their ip through papers and software so things like mapreduce gfs bigtable borgomega with kubernettes and much of what runs everyones cloud came from google with ip they just patented and then gave away and never charged a cent for same with backrub and later renamed pagerank but that patents is technically owned by stanford but anyone can use and why we have other search engines but we can see waymo has not yet given away any ip i mean none i monitor papers out of google closely as they usually become the standard way to do things in the tech world and nothing from waymo it is possible google will approach ip differently with waymo so far they have ot it could be that googlewaymo will share once they win the market that is also how google often times does things they only shared the tpu paper after they released the tpu version
340,thats why its an infrastructure play this land grab favors not just technology but execution having multiple traveling advanced mapping teams is a tough management problem its expensive resource intensive think all the business support staff you need for these teams all the software you need to manage their tasks and use them effectively the training program youll need to get them ready to do the mapping that being said it sounds like a great job for recent college grads you live in a new city for months then move on with all your recent college grad friends waymo has already mapped a bunch of cities where they test so expect the next launches in those cities
341,they have been training police departments and their cars a couple years ago and recently a booklet surfaced on how to disable and put out a fire for the pacifica vans im wondering about the edge cases for example if theres a fatal accident a police officer may decide to approach a vehicle and tell the driver to drive over the median to turn around i dont have confidence that the vans are capable of taking that direction today and you cannot expect the police to hop into the van to redirect it
342,i did an informal survey of my engineering friends about years ago to a person not one of them would let any of their kids anywhere near an sdc the kids ranged in age from to and included parents of driving teenagers where they admitted their kids were a hazard to themselves and others on the road they tended to worry about really strange rare situations where they admitted that even if they were with the younger kid or if their older kid was driving the outcome was still essentially chance but they would rather they or their kid killed themselves rather than software for younger kids they imagined roving gangs of kidnappers despite being aware of the mind boggling low rate of this occurring now less than per year for older driving age kids they still worried about the kid being kidnapped because the kid couldnt steer the car to safety or something like that for all ages the fact that they were x more likely to result in the death of their kids than an sdc still didnt hold up because while they agreed with the premise statistically they thought that they in particular could have better odds the good news is that none of this matters economics will push people to sdcs and well reap the benefits
343,while i agree with the above post that the average age of a car in the us is years that doesnt mean it will remain that way as the symbiotic relationship between sdcs and electric cars are relaized you can buy a chevy bolt today for less than k and it will cost you about year for depreciation electric insurance maintenancetires a new ice car will cost closer to kyear because of gas and higher maintenance but outside of a tesla electric is still a hard sell because consumers are unsure how it will workout for them as sdcs are rolled out as a service its much easier for a consumer to dip their toes into the electric car pool since they arent committing to a huge capital investment as consumers decide that an sdc fleet works for them as their nd or rd car and for some all their cars the average age of cars on the road should fall pretty fast as the nd and rd cars are mostly where these older cars are each car you own has to justify you spending k kyear on them when you can spend k kyear using an sdc fleet try this first figure up how much each of your cars cost you per year by calculating the depreciation gas costs insurance costs maintenance taxes etc this should be between k k even if you have a year old beater like i do then ask yourself if you would keep paying this if you had an uber like service where you could request and have a car in your driveway within minutes that would take you anywhere in town for would you keep your car
344,ca dmv thought about requiring information on take overs but decided against it they imo rightly thought it would discourage test drivers from taking over in situations where they really should ere on the side of caution
345,we step into vehicles with idiot humans all the time theyre much more likely to zone out freak out upon seeing a street light instinctively decide its an oncoming semi and swerve off a bridge humans suck as drivers
346,it is machine it will fail there is no machine in existence which has not failed at something and i am not talking here about cars i am talking about machines in general beside the point the point is if machines fail less often than humans then we will end up favoring the machine human error is far more acceptable than machine error no both are unacceptable we prosecute humans all the time for manslaughter with cars who is at fault when the machine fails the manufacturer will be at fault they will defend their case with copious evidence that they were not at fault there are lots of sensors and therefore tons of evidence sdc will drive very defensively and i bet they can get it to the point where the liabilityrisk is worth the reward theyll probably carry liability insurance per the number of sdc carsmiles driven the cost of this insurance will drop as the number of safe miles driven piles up now having people killed because a smartass somewhere thought ill make it hit the smaller object is not an acceptable outcome in any situation again you might think youre awesome and not a smartass but i recommend you listen to the horror stories from people who have killed people on bikes or children who ran out into a road and tell me whether or not you think you can do better than them computers can and will do a better job driving than humans accidents involving machines that make their own decisions happen already with machines a lot dumber than these cars they will continue to happen all humans have to do is make sure the tradeoff between human decision making and computer decision is safe enough to try did you know that airplanes land themselves on a regular basis that in fact they land themselves in conditions that humans would find difficult http enwikipediaorgwikiautoland
347,comparing airplane landings with self driving cars is a good imagination exercise in your case planes land on a strip that has no other obstacles they have enough room to maneuver and still the human element is there ready to take charge if the auto pilot screws up and if the auto pilot screw up the human element can decide to abort the landing and try again or can correct the error and proceed with it cars dont have that luxury the manufacturer will be at fault they will defend their case with copious evidence that they were not at fault have you ever heard about plane crashes lets the cases when the pilot is at fault or when the pilot intentionally crashes the plane we are left with a huge number of crashes where they have investigations that conclude in manufacturing errors or computer errors or engine fatiguefailure etc the manufacturer is clearly at fault in those cases yet i have never heard of them having to pay same will happen with the cars some guy somewhere will make a decision write it in software it will kill people it will be deemed acceptable we prosecute humans all the time for manslaughter with cars exactly can you prosecute a computer or in your little delusion being killed by a computer is far more acceptable than being killed by another driver

349,planes land on a strip that has no other obstacles they have enough room to maneuver flying a plane still has a large number of unpredictable variables wind mechanical failure etc they are programmed to deal with a lot of that or else you wouldnt see it used ill generally agree that cars encounter more but there is also a better out if this go wrong the car can simply be stopped the manufacturer is clearly at fault in those cases yet i have never heard of them having to pay and people still fly imagine that same will happen with the cars some guy somewhere will make a decision write it in software it will kill people it will be deemed acceptable yes i certainly hope so because its still human error it already happens its nothing new you take a chance everytime you go outside all sdc cars have to prove is that by and large they do a better drive driving than humans once that is definitely proven they will be let onto roads they will have lots of evidence to show that
350,i feel like quietly is unnecessary in the headline what do other redditors think casual passer by i have not read the article edit having read the article i think its important for google to publish transparency reports at this time im a robotics engineer in silicon valley and i understand that self driving cars are a technology that can work but i also feel like its a matter of public safety that we know who is testing self driving vehicles on the road and what happens with them google has business interests here but we also have public safety to consider im not worried about public safety with google but i am worried about the newly funded start up that thinks they can be secretive even when their tech is experimental ive heard rumors of self driving car start ups that test highly experimental software on public roads google can set an example here if they choose
351,i find it hard to see where a fully autonomous vehicle would run into a weird situation and need human assistance by all means if the vehicle is involved in a crash etc it would need assistance you will have to give some examples i dont see it the software or hardware would have to fail but that is a fault and the vehicle would need to be taken away for repair and maintenance
352,there will always be accidents we cant say a system should never be allowed to make mistakes tesla had a fatality simply because the system could not distinguish a semi truck trailer from the sky at an angle tesla corrected that and moved on there will always be something in the software that needs to be corrected as to why uber isnt accepting responsibility thats because our entire culture is litigious and should they admit fault they open themselves up to crippling lawsuits that could potentially end their autonomous taxi service which since they have actually done nothing worse than any other new technology including their peers would be excessive we really cannot expect every brand new technology to have a perfect fatality free rate and punish every company that fails that by suing them into oblivion but that us the way our current legal and media system works it could even destroy their company so they cant admit fault personally i feel that uber is extending a little far but thats what business does if you arent on the cutting edge then you are being shut out so i at least understand even if i dont agree
353,i think the problem is when the camera sends the raw footage it was before any sort of exposure adjustments made in the computer software the adjustments are easy to make and probably will be the first step before any further processing is done so basically you are looking at the same image with the same data except if it is processed with a simple global contrast enhancement process it is easier for naked eye but it contains the same amount of data for computers neither one should offer the same feeling as an actual driver because naked eye has its own adaptive exposure settings any programmers of sdc can confirm or refute this i also think if you actually drive through the streets you will see larger objects with more details because the angle of vision is narrower eqiv to a mm lens but the dashcams have much wider lenses
354,people have no idea how this works do you know how many software versions and data changes have happened since last october that incident tells you nothing about the current state of the system people that have already decided they dont like it are using that type of thing as a rallying cry

356,if your car crashes youre at fault unless you have someone else to blame the crash on like if someone else drove the car then they are at fault unless they have someone else to blame it on like if the crash only happened because the brakes on the car failed then the brake company is at fault unless they have someone else to blame like if the car owner installed the brakes incorrectly then the owner is at fault unless they have someone to blame like if the installation instructions gave bad directions fault is a very fluid thing a self driving vehicle doesnt add anything unique if a sdc crashes it is the owners problem unless they have someone that they can blame that could be the tire company for faulty tires or the sdc software company for faulty software but now the sdc software only has to perform as well as the promise for them to avoid fault like if you drive a car a billion miles without changing tires and the tires fail causing a crash you cant blame the tire company because you already drove beyond what they promised you when you bought the tires so sdcs are going to be the same you get what is promised if they fuck up what they promised you can sue them and win money if they fuck up stuff they never promised it is your problem the only meaningful question is how much will sdcs promise be that in years or or
357,huh i hadnt heard of openpilot before thats pretty cool but is there not a warrantyinsurance issue with replacing the native software on a safety feature like that feels like you would be totally fucked if you got in a wreck
358,youd also get f ed with toyotas software so no difference here unless you think toyota guarantees no mistakes
359,if autopilot fucked up and steered your car into another lane with a car in it tesla would absolutely be on the hook for that you cant release whatever bullshit garbage safety feature you want to and then walk away when it doesnt work my concern is that you would have a lot harder time saying suing a third party software company that was installed by you after the fact maybe you could do it but i have a hard time believing it would be just as easy as proving fault with an oem
360,yeah i dont know maybe it wouldnt make a difference but replacing the built in software does seem like it would be a big change if you tried to bring something to court if the oems software screws up they can argue that the driver should have been paying attention but the actual glitch is on one entity if you replace the original software pinning the issue on the software company vs the car manufacturer seems a lot more complicated teslas self driving stuff has only been around since and there are a lot of open cases against them about autopilot enabled accidents it seems premature to say that car manufactures never ever under any circumstances have any liability whatsoever for a malfunctioning ads when were only years in to the technology being introduced
