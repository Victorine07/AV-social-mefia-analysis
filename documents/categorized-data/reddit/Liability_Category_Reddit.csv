0,i agree im not totally against the idea of a self driving car and i love the type of car service subscription you have described i just think it allows for the introduction of extraneous advertisements and serious drawbacks to the vehicles that might make me hesitant to use them if there was a service the way you described and they utilized it from the get go or even phased it in the way youtube ads have been for example i would be very hesitant to use the service not only is my psyche being manipulated so could my wallet or my waistline everyone is ultimately responsible for their own actions but imagine a lawsuit in which someone wants damages from the car service because it drove them by a mcdonalds every day since they liked it on facebook and their bank account shows a mcdonalds purchase x a week and now they gained a ton of weight and needed surgery it opens a lot of doors for too targeted advertising target and the pregnancy outing with their targeted ad and potential litigation were already bombarded with ads and have to try to use self control in some cases to avoid the impulse purchases to eat healthier etc why would we willingly engage any possible technology or features that could make it even harder to control
1,i drive past about companies a day as is as soon as i can possibly move ill be on a bike for about minutes vs hour in either case the point is the same the path worked out from an optimized fastest route lowest gas algorithm is the same if they bypass that they are losing money if they make so much money on driving the extra block or two past the thing that drives me wild so fucking be it that speaks volumes more about the pliability of the passenger let them spend it let yourself reap the rewards not everyone wins in any system why cry about the abuse instead of optimizing your own use of it
2,the difference in risk should be reflected in insurance premia for autonomous vs other vehicles thats it
3,my concern is cost even if ai gets perfected to the point that autonomous driving is demonstrably safer than humans tomorrow how much would that feature add to the cost of a car how long before you can get an old beater with ai will it even be something you can merely buy once or will it end up as so many things are as a costly subscription as much as id love a self driving car and as much as it would make the roads safer if everybody had one there are lots of people who will never be able to afford a new dumb car let alone a smart one the requisite hardware for autonomous driving would not only have to be good and reliable and safe it would also have to get cheap enough that it doesnt price entry level buyers out of the new car market and will have to be around long enough that there are plenty of old cheap autonomous cars available for those who cant afford new at a guess id say youd need to wait about years after autonomous cars became mainstream before even thinking about legislation even then youd have to start with merely requiring the feature for new model years like we did for backup cameras a few years ago maybe another decade after that you could start financially disincentivizing human driven cars insurance surcharges and whatnot in the end i dont think youll ever need to ban them theyll just become too old and too expensive for any but hardcore enthusiasts to bother keeping years after ai driving becomes a standard feature cars without the feature will be years old think about cars that are years old now would you want to drive one every day theyre so old that theyre either rusting into the ground or have gone through the old and cheap phase and come out the other side into the realm of expensive classics sooner or later cars without ai will be like cars without fuel injection or abs or air conditioning theyll exist but theyll all have historic plates and theyll only get driven to car shows

5,there will be strict traditionalists that will always want to drive themselves they should be few in number and free to choose if one is objectively better that doesnt mean one should be illegal i dont envy their future insurance rates though
6,no if there was actual reliable public transportation throughout the country id consider it until then no fucking way
7,this is a delicate question it depends on a lot of factors there would be vast differences in attitudes between urban suburban and rural drivers their access to public transport would be vastly different as well and their access to features such as wireless charging accident avoidance infrastructure communication vehicle to vehicle for example would all be different based on whats available also there is a major set of people who enjoy driving this could continue via private roads though which would mostly be a large improvement in liability and safety driving could be a dedicated hobby which may prove out to be excellent compared to today
8,wont be up to us after a point insurance companies will demand it
9,being able to do this depends on the reliability of future autonomous vehicles their popularity and for a time public backlash from probably a fair number of drivers that wont want to give up driving this might turn into a heated political debate eventually in general no it would hugely sacrifice freedom to mitigate a level of risk almost all of us already accept let the transition to self driving happen naturally without bans or coercion
10,the elements of individual freedom dont matter we dont let people drive without a seat belt just because they want to because we understand how unsafe that decision is well rather because insurance companies leaned on the govt to write that into law because it saves them money on claims but it has the added benefit of also being the safer decision this kind of ban is a long time from being enforceable on a practical level though like literally decades were only now getting to the point where a majority of vehicles have current autonomous safety features lane departure prevention distracted driving warnings etc and thats not even fully autonomous realistically were probably years away from the point where most vehicles are fully autonomous thats the earliest i can see enforcing this kind of legislation and even then it would be more like states wont issue registration for vehicles that arent autonomous rather than an actual ban and some people will still try to ignore it because there will always be that segment of the population that arrogantly believes they can drive better than a computer
11,no but id support private insurance companies charging an arm and a leg if people want to continue driving them
12,at some point i would expect the manufacturer not the driver to be responsible for collisions and insurance since the driver isnt really driving
13,at some point i would expect the manufacturer not the driver to be responsible for collisions and insurance since the driver isnt really driving
14,the nature of insurance would change as well assuming the level of efficacy op is suggesting autonomous car owners wouldnt even be buying liability coverage because they wouldnt be liable for anything the car did that means insurance would be discretionary as opposed to today when youre required to have at least liability coverage insurers would have to make some kind of shift as that revenue is lost

17,yeah this is why im ultimately against it a ban would hurt the low income people today its not super rare to see vehicles from the early s and the s either because the driver is frugal or just too poor to upgrade in or whenever we have autonomous vehicles there will undoubtedly be many in the same position driving and cars and banning all non autonomous vehicles is effectively crippling these peoples ability to travel if we have reliable and affordable mass public transit everywhere then sure maybe but i doubt that will be the case
18,they should also be subject to criminal strict liability in the event that they injure or kill someone
19,i present to you the official pennsylvania horse and buggy operator manual in california the horse and the rider actually has right of way in many cases if the rider signals for you to slow down and you hit their animal youre held liable in fact they even have new safety laws that went into effect a couple days ago mandating helmets for under riders and reflectors on your horse when riding on the highway after dark new california traffic safety laws sideshows chp
20,what about the freedom of someone to drive a car they can fix themselves id imagine a lot of technology in self driving cars is proprietary and would stop people from having the ability to take personal responsibility of their own property or even have the liberty to use it on public roads
21,you dont need to be at fault personally to need insurance just at a loss if something bad happens businesses are insured through the hilt for everything
22,indeed thats what i mean by the end of liability insurance protecting yourself when youre found to be at fault you would still ideally insure the asset itself though like how today people opt for different amounts of collision coverage whatll be interesting is how responsibility is placed on manufacturers harm to passengers due to dangerous coding mistakes could be signed away as part of using the car but that wouldnt cover the pedestrian the car struck settlements with human drivers can be quick because no one wants to pay for a lawyer but settlements with an autonomous car manufacturer theyd just make life miserable for individual plaintiffsthere would need to be a class action suit after many people are hurt or some kind of regulatory regime

25,we dont because its too burdensome to subject people to that level of liability just so they can get around but if we had reliable autonomous driving tech people who choose not to use are volunteering for that liability
26,we dont because its too burdensome to subject people to that level of liability just so they can get around but if we had reliable autonomous driving tech people who choose not to use are volunteering for that liability
27,non autonomous cars arent but its easier to designate responsibility if something wrong happens yielding by default could be dangerous too as it doesnt take into account any other context car free future doesnt require knocking anything down just repurposing imo
28,non autonomous cars arent but its easier to designate responsibility if something wrong happens disagree its distressingly hard to hold reckless drivers to account and even harder to exact meaningful damages from them car free future doesnt require knocking anything down just repurposing imo most of the us isnt built at a density that can support reliance on public transit
29,dont generally worry about those things now anymore than i worry about buildings collapsing on me when i walk down the street we have laws signage and licensing for a reason we also teach our children to watch out for cars i worry about these things all the time because i live in a city where everyone drives like a raging psycho and routinely run down pedestrians without anyone being held accountable what i do worry about is my and my familys safety in the event of the failure of any one of the hundreds of systems required for autonomous driving clearly the technology is not there yet in terms of reliability but we will get there in any event non autonomous cars break too i worry that if the cascadia quake hits and cell service goes out then i cant get anywhere in my truck be it to get supplies like water or to get my family to our trailer an emergency manual failsafe would almost be the easiest thing in the world to include
30,if an autonomous car hits and kills someone who is liable the driver or the car manufacturer
31,manufactures will do everything possible to avoid this responsibility including encouraging only autonomous vehicles on the roads to make it peoples responsibility if they get hit rather than the manufactures
32,i dont think the replies are in favor of driving but more the freedom to have the option i personally would never drive again if this was a real option i hate driving but not as much as i hate police states and governmental over reach throwing axes in the middle of the street is just not an honest comparison ive driven my entire life and never killed a single person most people have in fact but if i started throwing axes in public id probably injure or kill someone in less than a week good drivers who honestly enjoy driving or perhaps just dont trust automation shouldnt be punished for other peoples mistakes just like we dont ban driving on holidays because its the time when the most drunk drivers are out we punish the individuals responsible not the entire society
33,i mean we are already talking about an environment where the only motor vehicles allowed are autonomous im sure the law will be updated to clarify that its the manufacturers responsibility to make sure their cars avoid these types of collisions
34,those types of techniques can certainly reduce the incidence of false positives but in situations with enough vehicles and specular reflective surfaces your system can easily have very low confidence i used to work with vector templating system that can auto align using lasers and retro reflective material and even with all the tricks we lock out the ability to align two heads at the same time that are too close together these types of visual systems are very sensitive to interference i mean i worked on systems that needed thou accuracy on stationery mounts but i can certainly see a half dozen lidar scanners in very close proximity causing enough interference to atleast lower the confidence enough to make them significantly less reliable not to mention due to the fact that if a company wanted to use visible light lasers for improved range eyesafe and r systems are still incredibly distance limited for dynamically mounted sensors generally use at least other machine vision technology is needed to have adequate active track most of the vehicles that i have seen equipped with lidar systems are also using or other additional methods like machine vision with cameras and actual radar there is a reason we dont see automotive lidar on vehicles outside of experimental self driving applications and close to the ground warehouse autos controlled by a single server or coordinated through a hivemind iot architecture that is also supported by a server teslas decision to forgo lidar altogether didnt happen by accident its far easier to coordinate disparate devices when the scanners you are using arent emitters
35,you bring up good points i actually work on lidar for vehicles in my current position and so far i dont know of any oems that plan to rely on only one sensor type for the autonomous driving systems besides tesla using vision only lidar has its place in the sensor suite but a lot of the hard work happens at the sensor fusion level and the ai built into the computers taking all the sensor data in and processing it those systems can identify when they are in a situation where the lidar is not the most reliable sensor to take data in and adjust accordingly in the short term lidar is an improvement in safety for collision detection and automatic breaking systems to avoid the collision vs the existing sensors so it helps to enable the intermediate autonomous driving levels before getting to fully autonomous operation
36,i know that stroke victims with damage to brocas area the area mostly responsible for speech production are often aware of their cognitive disability ive heard it described as having the sensation of having a word on the tip of your tongue but its every word all the time and being unable to find it
37,insurance on the other hand becomes a much trickier problem
38,cars would stop whenever a pedestrian approaches and not whenever they feel like it maybe also accidents happen all the time with human drivers too the quesiton is who is more reliable but yes public transport would be suerior oc
39,this was peak dumbass when people started believing this shit was possible ok so your plan is to replace cars and service vehicles with tech that remotely doesnt exist mind you despite your highway auto features you think are even close this level and make sure they can all reliable communicate with each other and a new grid and all software companies will play fair and every car owner will keep up maintenance to for community integrity and thats just to start i have an idea for an electric vehicle that can use less space carry way more people and still get you where you want to go safer and more efficiently than this dystopia you imagine choo choo choo mother fuckers choo choo choo
40,thats the beauty of self driving cars they drive super defensively for insurance reasons just walk out into the street the cars will just start slowing down
41,they dont want you or anyone to be a pedestrian spend money on a car insurance and pay tolls
42,hey ive work in automation for a long time and the solution would be very simple push a button that will activate a series of software logic events to alert cars in a certain radius a human is walking across the intersection the way i would do it is all algorithms that predict the vehicle is going to intersect or potentially intersect a human will be put into a safety mode basically slows the car down a lot emphasizes the camera systems to verify path isnt blocked and overall put each vehicle in a certain vicinity on a high alert for potential human injury once the systems for the cross walk verify all humans are across and the pathway is safe it will eliminate the high alert program and fall back into its routine by the time this is a thing all cars in a square mile radius will communicate will all other vehicles they will constantly be sharing vehicle speeds locations destinations future predicted routes and all kinds of things with every car around them and an extremely strong computer quantum computer possibly will make corrections to the flow of traffic accordingly we have many years before we eliminate stop lights and order traffic rules but when it happens its going to be super cool plus robots are x more reliable than a human could ever imagine
43,since we have no clue how cognition ie the abilty to think and reason works in a biological brain we have no ability to create machines that have that ability either deep learning algorithms and neural network software do not and cannot have this ability regardless of how much training data you throw at it a child knows the difference between a real stop sign and a stop sign on someones clothing they also know that a stop sign is still a stop sign even if it has a sticker or some graffitti on it these so called improperly named ais do not know the difference furthermore any so called self driving car that has to randomly pull over to the side of the road and stop then call a remote human operator to guide it manually through whatever it is it cant handle is not in any way shape or form ready to be responsible for the safety of human occupants or be allowed on public roads its all a failed technology that will never be ready for real world use these companies all know this but have invested so much money in the development that they insist on marketing it anyway to recover that money or go bankrupt dont fall for the self driving car meme
44,you cannot unless you buy a self driving skateboard available from various manufacturers also need registration insurance and dl for the skateboards
45,this would suck and all but the software would be more reliable than humans
46,knowing elon musk hed invest in this immediately if he could also knowing musks great track record with reliability itd have a death rate
47,liability is going to be a problem though now even if a car completely malfunctions resulting in an accident the driver is still mainly responsible for any accidents car manufacturers would be held liable for any accidents caused by self driving cars and they dont want that
48,liability is going to be a problem though now even if a car completely malfunctions resulting in an accident the driver is still mainly responsible for any accidents car manufacturers would be held liable for any accidents caused by self driving cars and they dont want that
49,liability is going to be a problem though now even if a car completely malfunctions resulting in an accident the driver is still mainly responsible for any accidents car manufacturers would be held liable for any accidents caused by self driving cars and they dont want that
50,hm i beg to differ in this one unreliable equipment that doesnt kill en masse is fine but this is a little over the top since the payers for this system are rich and could net us more profits what i say we do is create a free system for crossing that has a death rate then let people pay for ones with lower death rates getting gradually more safe the more youre willing to pay
51,which in my experience in spite of being safer and decreasing the risk of accidents and traffic jams rarely ever happens if the rules of the road were followed to a t instead of having of drivers thinking theyre better than most drivers and being ok disobeying the rules because theyre familiarity with a car outruled their sense of dangerresponsibility instead of having selfish drivers who arbitrarily decide to get ahead of everyone else despite no inherent need for it instead of everyone creating barely an inch gap between cars or taking advantage of those with enough space by forcing yourself in there the road would be much safer and more efficient which is why trains rule
52,just a waiver and an insurance and itll be fine that cost can also be included in the car price
53,car manufacturers would be held liable for any accidents caused by self driving cars and they dont want that thats not the status quo drivers currently retain all liability for accidents caused by self driving cars do you really think the situation will change to the detriment of car manufacturers
54,car manufacturers would be held liable for any accidents caused by self driving cars and they dont want that thats not the status quo drivers currently retain all liability for accidents caused by self driving cars do you really think the situation will change to the detriment of car manufacturers
55,simple divide up train carts like gondolas people can have their own private compartment rather then big ones elons tesla tunnel or whatever is essentially just that minus it being on a track and connected but in all honesty wealthy individuals want to sell as much gas cars insurance plans road work tires etc we dont have trains because it threatens giant corporations business models its the same reason we have had to fighting for green energy coal and oil dont want their businesses to become obsolete
56,i mean yea some of those are pretty true and they tend to piss me off especially the text while drive situation but yall cyclists need to stop acting like you own the fucking road because while some drivers can be very irresponsible while they are driving yall cyclists need to keep an eye out yo so i rlly just ends up going both ways for both of yall
57,the buying power of american fuel taxes also been greatly been eroded by inflation and more fuel efficient and electric vehicles kinda like car insurance crazy i am only required to carry for property damage and for injury this has not changed in decades and probably originates from a time when bought houses here but nowadays does not even cover rent for months
58,this always pops into my mind when talking about evs are there any reliable numbers about the difference in emissions for evs and traditional cars when the production of the batteries etc is taken into account
59,i dont think youre really aware of how cbtc actually works or how efficient trains are also its a lot better to just run as many as possible than to do some weird tech bro efficiency bullshit with it like rail examining the number of people waiting why having people state where theyre going this is horrible ux also why also train tickets turnstyles dynamically allocating trains to provide additional transit as necessary this already happens automatically slowing down certain trains by a couple minutes in order to alleviate congestion in stations what what congestion if theres congestion youd want more trains to move people this screws over people already on the train this makes them unreliable it is better for humans if there are consistent schedules without unexpected delays or speed ups like thats part of what makes taking the bus so horrible you dont know when its going to show up it gets stuck in traffic sometimes they skip your stop because the bus is full or the driver wants to and why would you need regenerative braking in trains do you know how trains work they speed up to the safest maximum speed then cut the power to slow down barely using brakes to come to a complete stop at the station if you ride a subway in a dense area like manhattan youll feel them pedal to the metal about halfway from station to station then they cut the power skilled operators can glide in in fact using the brakes on trains sucks horribly it fucks up your balance can make stuff knock over etc theres literally a japanese metro sim all about getting it as perfect as possible
60,i am a newcomer here thank you rplace i have owned a car for approximately months and frankly buying the thing was kind of against my will not like with a gun to my head but with just society in general making me feel i needed the thing buy a car it opens up more opportunities in my head that always sounded like join the rest of us in a massive financial moneysink youll love the a month you have to pay just for the right to own it not including gas which is spiking to record levels less than a year after i bought the car thanks putin all to get around slightly faster but at much higher personal risk than the metro system youve been taking for literal decades of your life its a great opportunity and im not saying that drivers shouldnt have car insurance im asking why i had to be a driver
61,kids are isolated in the same way their parents are by suburbs actual quote from a policy maker in the s debt encumbered homeowners dont go on strike the whole point became to divide the working class geographically based on race because of the threat of socialism so whites fled to the burbs and the city became ghettoized and neglected people got houses the government got a reliable conservative political bloc and the system rolled on once that was in place neoliberalism was the inevitable result cars are very literally the result of an intentionally isolated and fragmented working class
62,i pay ish a month for insurance and ish a month for a car payment the car is literally known as one of the cheapest pieces of plastic shit south korea can legally put on a highway chevy spark i have had full on fantasies about destroying that thing and paying it off with the insurance money i wish i had never set eyes on the damn thing i only use it for grocery shopping and i have to remember to turn it on every week so the just installed rare small size out of stock everywhere had to get a refurbished instead battery doesnt die i hate exercise but this car alone motivated me to get a bike when i move the neighborhood i live in is too unsafe to be outside in
63,cargo ships are responsible for of emissions much less than cars
64,driving can be a fun activity but your hobby should not be enforced on everyone else to partake in especially when it causes many problems instead driving for sport or fun should take place in a controlled safe environment like a racetrack with people who enjoy the sport all around you im also not sure how you can like being stuck in traffic most days and find that fun maybe you arent usually stuck in traffic but for the majority of people driving in most places in the world that is the reality and it is not fun your experience of public transit was poor and that is one thing this subreddit is against we advocate for safer reliable frequent and fast public transit so that your commute of minutes could get down to or maybe even less in many places around the world public transit is the fastes option you also complain about the cleanliness of public transit and that could also be fixed you just need to help by advocating for more funding towards your local public transit system
65,aight here we go it isnt the existence of cars that is responsible for climate change it isnt the existence of cars that is responsible for climate change people cheap out and buy old cars or big trucks and never ever think about fuel efficiency and people often drive to the same location in multiple cars decreasing efficiency cars arent dangerous humans are laws just dont allow autopilot systems therefor they arent developed almost all crashes are caused by human error this is full on right nothing to debate here lol this is made worse tho because of course you need the biggest truck with the biggest engine because your pp grows or whatever cars arent even that expensive its only that you are all poor apparently see the nordics cars cost like times as much there if you dont live in a big city you can not use public transport whats the alternative this is the result of poor planning oh wait see you use a car to go to multiple places there cant be less parking places than cars there must be more if you want to park your car there must be that many parking spaces as sais public transport wont and cant work for other than densely populated areas if you only have passengers per trip the perfect place to fit those and go to a specific location is a automobile what if i continue because this whole debate is idiotic i agree somewhat with you the problem i have is that most of the whole subreddit faces everything from the perspective of the united states of murica and even all most of the sources and suggested videos in the main post are about the f cking us you dont seem to get that this is the world wide web not the freedom network prove me wrong i dare you i want you rip karma
66,i totally agree i take public transport to work the issue is the methods of legislating the car out of the city centre right now in the uk birmingham council are charging per calendar day to drive within the ring road if i head to a venue on an evening and have to load out equipment and drive home at i am charged the ring road contains all of the music venues and the vast majority of rehearsal spaces several of the rehearsal spaces are already making posts about going out of business because of this i have a diesel car i could sell it for k and buy a version for k and then be able to drive into town for free if there was any genuine alternative to driving or selling my car for something else i would do it i cant afford an electric car and dont have a driveway so couldnt charge at home regardless terraced houses in the uk make this impossible in a lot of poorer areas taxis arent appropriate ive previously run charity events putting on regular gigs in liverpool and birmingham and even with a good relationship with certain taxi companies half of the drivers refuse to load amps or drum kits into their car enforce it on the business not the people its exactly the same way companies are responsible for of emissions but the onus is increasingly put onto the individual
67,yeah i was hit by a car while cycling once i walked away from the incident down a bike but only scraped and bruised otherwise so i got off easy but fuck man im out here trying to do the responsible thing and this is what i get for it fuck off
68,some people feel that way and many of them were just raised to think that was the goal of life not everyone feels that way and certainly not most people most of us want to be near others i shouldnt need gas insurance and an hour of roundtrip driving time to see my friends commute to work or pick up groceries we want to be near where things are and spend less time commuting while living a healthier more sustainable lifestyle that comes with being car free plus if you really wanted your own land away from people youd pick a rural area not a suburb which has all the inconveniences of neighbors and the inconveniences of rural living with none of the advantages of either
69,do you know if they have plans for a model with maybe more off road tires out in the midwest is all dirt roads and i know from experience the more street tires dont like loose gravel insurance views me as humpty dumpy for a reason ironically the only reason i havent been to the hospital is my motorbike
70,anti science yeah no fuck you not being signed up to your ethical agenda is not anti science animal products increase risk of death from multiple causes by anywhere near million deaths a year no so point does not apply since you mentioned the who their website roomquestions and answersitemcancer carcinogenicity of the consumption of red meat and processed meat says the number might be point does apply its also affecting climate change climate change is point your claim here is actually about air pollution from arable farming as far as i can tell however that is a fair point that i hadnt considered and is another issue with intensive meat production that requires large amounts of cropland to support it id say that the answer there is more responsible arable farming to grow those crops though point does apply an animal based diet is more expensive people arent spending of their income on meat your second im not reading one from vegan food and living thats clearly going to be biased link also says could be cheaper but the main difference here is that there is no meat dependency that is forcing people into that choice they are choosing to spend that extra money because they like eating that food point does apply to all of food production greenhouse gases are from animal products while providing nowhere near of the calories and what proportion of that is from intensive farming you didnt even contest the point i made there so my question maybe should have been worded differently i assume people are already reducing intake of animal products based on their morals and why they are here some even vegan so im guessing this is a vegan friendly place i guess that would have been a better thing for me to say yes it absolutely would have been a better thing for you to say there is an analogy to be made here like car dependent sprawl and stroads in city centres intensive farming for meat production is a bad thing with negative effects and should be discouraged many people can improve their lives and environmental impact by reducing how much meat they eat veganism is analogous to some ridiculous ban all cars immediately and you shouldnt use asphalt roads because theyre car products position edit and now look youve dragged me into a stupid argument about this unrelated issue im going to stop replying under this post now
71,yeah no fuck you not being signed up to your ethical agenda is not anti science not being vegan doesnt make you anti science and i havent claimed that it does denying those things apply to animal products is though because science tellsshows us that they do apply by anywhere near million deaths a year no so point does not apply since you mentioned the who their website says the number might be so deaths only matter if they are exactly million you also have to look at indirect deaths through heart disease etc which consuming animal products increases the likelihoodrisk of plus ptsdsuicide of slaughterhouse workers etc climate change is point your claim here is actually about air pollution from arable farming as far as i can tell however that is a fair point that i hadnt considered and is another issue with intensive meat production that requires large amounts of cropland to support it id say that the answer there is more responsible arable farming to grow those crops though you cant do it responsibly on a large scale when using such an inefficient food source animal products though even if you do it as best as possible for animal products you are still growing multiple times the number of crops you would need to if you didnt consume animal products its still a big impact people arent spending of their income on meat your second im not reading one from vegan food and living thats clearly going to be biased link also says could be cheaper but the main difference here is that there is no meat dependency that is forcing people into that choice they are choosing to spend that extra money because they like eating that food but that doesnt matter maybe i worded it weirdly or you are misunderstanding it doesnt matter if the figures are exactly the same the arguments the reasoning is the same apologies if i caused the confusion i was trying to say that the arguments are the same i wouldnt say its meat dependency in the same way as cars but up until a few years ago that would be considered the case veganism is becoming increasingly easy something it seems like people in this sub wants for cars just because veganism is further along doesnt mean it isnt comparable i assume you wouldnt abandon your principles regarding cars if other modes of transport become easier and also the link uses a study its not just the opinion when directly compared it is cheaper than the cheapest meat but it can be a similar price if someone goes expensive on the vegan products meat is not cheaper than the cheapest plants even calorie for calorie or protein to protein and what proportion of that is from intensive farming you didnt even contest the point i made there intensive farming makes up the vast majority of animal products it has to with the amount of people in the world if you are against intensive farming but for the consumption of animal products then you either think that only some people should be allowed them or everyone has to be limited to like portion a week veganism is analogous to some ridiculous ban all cars immediately and you shouldnt use asphalt roads because theyre car products position its not at all veganism is against animal abuse stopping consuming animal products only because of the environment would be your example not veganism edit and now look youve dragged me into a stupid argument about this unrelated issue im going to stop replying under this post now i stated a fact and asked a question about this sub which you decided to respond to by denying science dont see how i dragged you into it
72,thats the thing these are classified as an ebike not a vehicle because they dont go faster than mph so they only qualify for the ebike credit but you dont need to pay insurance on them so its got its pros and cons its also got turn signals and brake lights that alone is great
73,erm yes because even though cities are responsible for lots of pollution they also house lots of people for the same reason that a busses are more environmentally friendly than cars even though a single bus emits more than a single car there are exceptions if you live in an off grid smallholding and walk everywhere then sure but most people in the countryside live in centrally heated houses and drive trucks
74,people will be more accepting of the technology when they realize their car insurance premiums will be much less
75,a large portion of domestic flights are business related itll probably be cheaper to still fly employees out even forgetting about liability issues this article is probably another years out still
76,airline industry hotels interstate businesses insurance gonna disrupt a lot
77,it will disrupt many industries insurance less accidents police less tickets real estate people now no longer have to live in the city or moderately close to where they work for many jobs you could now work in the car on your way in and leave early working on your way home taxi no need for a taxi driver
78,i think its more competition for the overpriced rail industry then airlines over here in uk anyway would you rather stand and pay huge amounts to commute with unreliable train times and crammed into train cars or lay back and let your car drive you to work or your destination in comfort cheaper
79,will it disrupt the car insurance industry as well if most cars are driverless then why pay car insurance does this mean that liability shifts to manufacturers
80,will it disrupt the car insurance industry as well if most cars are driverless then why pay car insurance does this mean that liability shifts to manufacturers
81,there was a showerthought on driverless vehicles it aint like in the movies where they will just run you off the road at high speeds they will break for literally everything no matter what so they are perfect to cut in line it all stems from legal liability and all that bs
82,seeing people get excited about disrupting the airline industry makes me wish that we did some basic maintenanceupgrades on our train infrastructure years ago imagine if we converted our aging network of slow and decrepit trains into sleek reliable fast trains
83,yeah but you have to own the fucking car and pay monthly insurance and possibly debt on it sitting in a car hours sounds absolutely worse than doing and airport run esp if public transit can take you to the airport
84,unfortunately trains as sometimes x as expensive and not that reliable in where i am from poland
85,not always compared to low cost carriers like ryanair or easyjet trains are almost never cheaper but they are incredibly reliable in some countries switzerland and germany for example and faster than driving the same distance france tgv also you can buy unlimited use passes in many countries for annual or short term vacation trips xb cries in british southern rail
86,british trains are incredibly reliable minutes late of the time
87,a company is most likely gonna be responsible for it youll pay a subscription fee to access them youll check in and out if theres various complaints submitted by other customers on cars where youve just been odds are youll be fined or something
88,i have a year old vehicle and ive put less than miles on it because i travel for work the longest trip i take regularly is about miles to the airport and i use uber for that my vehicle was msrp consider thats yr to own the vehicle yr for insurance yr in fuel yr in maintenance so thats yr to own the vehicle tco and i barely use it thats month for transportation its for me to uber tofrom the airport if i do that once a week im paying m just for that the other few times im driving im going to the movies or the grocery store if i could pay m for a subscription vehicle i would actually save money instead of having to take an uber to the airport i could have the car just come be ready for me schedule a hour window for the weekend to have a car to go grocery shopping or to run errands then let it go do whatever
89,it would also shift liability from the driver to the manufacturer and in the event of an incident may require a systematic shutdown of the technology across the fleet until an investigation is conducted and the problem is fixed something very tricky in ai since the factors behind the ais decision may not be knowable
90,it doesnt matter self driving cars wont catch on and heres why when a human being kills someone else with a car its easy for the rest of us to wrap our heads around someone did something wrong and someone else died theres a reason theres someone to blame we can assign that blame assess our penalties and move on with our lives when a self driving car kills someonewho do we blame whose fault is it who do we punish who do we fine who do we arrest whose license do we take away the software engineer good luck finding a software engineer willing to take on that kind of liability when something goes wrong we need a reason we need someone to punish we need someone to blame self driving cars take that away even if software errors cause a few hundred deaths a year versus the thousands caused by human error i predict society will choose human error because there is nothing to do when a program kills someone except change the program and assure everyone it wont happen again assurances from a software engineer are not something people are liable to accept

92,im curious to see how self driving cars will impact driver responsibility from a legal perspective if im behind the wheel of one and the car hits a person would i have to answer for it maybe this has been addressed but im also not super familiar with the topic
93,the issue is liability more than anything else whos fault is it when the robot car kills someone
94,and whos responsible in a car accident if all the vehicles are autonomous eg without any human in control at that moment thats some good legal question imo
95,i want to know who is responsible for a self driving car killing someone if a family member of yours is killed by a drunk driver you have someone to blame you have someone to take to court and you have someone that can be reprimanded by the law if a toyota self driving car kills someone can the family of that person expect toyota to be responsible morally and financially
96,so who will be responsible for these deaths if you cant fix faulty drivers with a faulty machine then perhaps you need to go back to the drawing board
97,its the liability that will need to be sorted if i run you over you could get a couple shekels if toyota runs you over you could hundreds of thousand shekels
98,the future is coming and its not going to stop self driving cars and swarming behavior where cars communicate with each other and move together like a school of fish are going to change our motoring life as soon as self driving cars reduce accidents and save lives it will start with owners getting steep insurance and tax discounts eventually people who drive themselves will be targeted for the risk of accidents and penalized with insurance and taxes and eventually it will likely become illegal to operate a motor vehicle by hand in many areas it comes down to safety all of our traffic laws car insurance tickets fines are all there to promote safe driving but when the car can drive itself more safely than you can its a no brainer like it or not its going to force you out of the drivers seat its not so bad though you will be the first generation of people to maintain your independence even long after you are too old to safely drive anymore you will get hours of time back with which to do other things while commuting to work catch up on reading get some work done play some mobile games browse the net etc finally it will also empower metro ride sharing and better traffic management in urban areas buses and mass transportation are efficient but mainly done in order to cut down traffic however when traffic manages itself its going to be possible to commute in smaller highways at higher speed without traffic jams and a swarm of self driving cars can be as efficient as multiple people taking the bus it would only make sense for cities to augment their public transportation with ride sharing where fleets of public cars are spread throughout the city and will take you wherever you want to go many city dwellers already find it difficult to own and operate a car this would be the next step
99,the discussion was huge when the first person was killed by a self driving car from uber small animals squirrels rabbits cats etc get run over by cars all the time driven by humans no issues there but when humans get run over by cars driven by machine this is the part where discussion about whether or not all of this is worth it if someone runs over someone with a car the person gets charged with manslaughter murder etc if self driving cars run humans over then self driving cars arent liable whos at fault here
100,id happily give the responsibility of driving to an self driving car if that means everyone else does the same i know it can be counter intuitive to a lot of people but this will indeed save so many lives people used to not trust elevators when they first were invented they literally had to make sure an operator was inside the lift to press the buttons in order to create a sense of safety
101,id highly recommend reading this visual short story http i guess thats what youd call it its written from the perspective of a man programming the user interface of a stasis pod meant for extremely long distance travel and has to program what it does if it suffers catastrophic failure imo its the trolley problem all over again the deaths we have more direct responsibility for will weigh much more heavily on us than the numerous more wed be preventing
102,everyone will buy this and get a life insurance lol
103,autonomous driving adoption rate will be driven by insurance companies autonomous cars will be way safer therefore less claims and insurance companies will reward the owners of those cars while pushing the premiums up of every non autonomous car driver until it doesnt make sense to own a car that isnt autonomous
104,i feel like the manufacturers should all come together to create a company with the top minds from all groups which would be responsible for automation i think if one company created the base automation for all it would be safer than all automakers hacking and slashing their way to a good enough product it also would stop the inevitable manufacturing monopolies if any company could start up and create a new type of vehicle and just apply existing tested automation to it
105,first it was self driving cars will lower your insurance now this hundreds vs thousands not good enough how about hundreds vs millions is that better what ever happened to if it saves one child its worth it etc so please stand up if you are willing to die in support of statistics like this by all means if you want to sacrifice your lives so others can read their phones while non driving you should probably turn in your drivers licenses right now
106,when someone hits you with their car you can hold them liable when an empty car hits you by itself whos held liable
107,the auto industry needs to convince consumers that the idea of the computer driving your car can be a good thing lentz said they are certainly trying to convince consumers that self driving cars are a good thing there have already been several deaths associated with self driving cars there will be more governments have waived the standards applied to human driven vehicles to encourage self driving vehicles you can seek damages from a driver who injures you how do you seek redress when you are injured by a vehicle which is not a legal entity and which has no moral or legal responsibility for its actions these are dangerous times
108,one of our engineers at my company told me that everyone will go to driverless cars even the people who say they wont he said everyone will change because of insurance the price of insurance on a self driving car will be pennies compared to how much meat bag driven cars insurance will be it will just eventually price everyone out
109,the numerical analysis of human life isnt the only logic to take into consideration here though someone has to be responsible for the autonomous cars and who will that be the manufacturer the owner the operator insurance companies governments and this responsibility isnt just for the eventuality of injury or death but for preventative maintenance how many cars have malfunctioning electronics or damaged hardware on an autonomous car even an under performing computer or sensor could be disastrous aircraft with similar albeit much simpler systems have to be inspected every operating hours if were going to have autonomous cars they cant just be thrown into the world like any other car theres a lot of legal and social stuff that has to be sorted out

112,its the difference between population statistics on average were better off and individuals individually were not thrilled about the ai being responsible for our lives reality is that cars have so many automated systems already and a failure could already have negative results
113,was actually thinking about this earlier after heard on npr a section talking about the recent uber accident in arizona the guy at toyota is not wrong here think about all the accidents involving drunk or reckless driving or road rage every year i also wonder how the car insurance company is gonna survive once the automobile becomes industry standard
114,its not just a matter of logic combine the algorithm with insurance risk and micro targeted data and were not far away from the car choosing to mow down half a dozen shop workers on the pavement to avoid the hedge fund manager crossing the road
115,my only argument is that if testing needs to be done they can do it on private testing tracks and should have these test have the developers act as the test subjects to walk in front of these cars to recreate the tempe incident i dont believe testing these cars over the next to years when no one is liable for fatalities and uber can simply pay off the family justifies the greater good of public safety anyone that can justify this based on statistics is cold soul of a person the outcome will be that people die at a lower rate while millions will also lose their jobs to ai and also die a slow death
116,well there is bound to be a sea change in the insurance real estate gas station auto repair auto sales and retail and shipping logistics industries and more autonomous vehicles may become the biggest game changer weve seen since the advent of well the automobile
117,on senors is anybody worried about people not maintaining their cars how many have driven around with a check engine light on now imagine people driving around with an intermittent sensor will people pay for repairs immediately or try to coast by will people possibly buy a car they cant afford to maintain and end up with a hazard to the public on the road or will we have to maintain our cars to the highest standards complete with maintenance logbooks day checks etc edit you guys have some great ideas but its not fool proof edit isnt the goal of self driving cars to not have humans drive ever or allow a car to drive an impaired person home sensors dont fail after a drive they can fail at anytime some sensors will fail intermittently or it will pass the bit built in test but display inaccurate information or lets say it fails reverts to manual control and the human being onboard is drunk edit i am a pilot and our airliners have lots of redundancy but systems and sensors still fail and its up to the human to sort them out if pulling over isnt an option which it isnt in an aircraft this is despite having highly regulated and mandatory maintenance ive had airspeed very important become unreliable loss of trim position indication think car doesnt know steering angle generator failures power distribution issues in which a bank of systems fail autopilot and autothrottle failures etc all of these passed their bits before going flying im just providing some food for thought i dont hate the idea of self driving cars but to say automation is always better than a human i dont think tells the whole story
118,i disagree the risk will be covered by insurance companies and it will be the insurance companies that will make automated vehicles a reality just like they did seat belts airbags crash tests etc
119,laxer than uber will be responsible for maintaining and deploying sdv fleets in the poorer regions of america i dont trust them to be as safe as waymo or competent drivers
120,so far tesla is setting the standard by taking responsibility if their own car is at fault for the accident but it must be the autopilot driving and the car must be at fault so not you hitting the gas thinking its the brake or someone rear ending your car because they thought it should speed up on yellow and not prepare to stop for red but if the car decides to change lanes into a semi tesla takes responsibility all three scenarios have happened to tesla
121,and you will be more than welcome to drive your own car in a world of self driving cars the laws and regulations will just change to make you completely responsible for anything you do so in the event you get hit and choose to save yourself over someone on the sidewalk you should be charged with murder since you chose to kill someone to save yourself
122,but you trust yourself and other humans considering the literal thousands of deaths each year often when one driver was doing nothing wrong whatsoever that seems misplaced statistically we dont seem to be very reliable drivers and if you consider the absurd amount of things that computers do the number of processes they are capable of handling just how many of them there are particularly if we include all smart devices and how many untold hours they are in use every single day by how many people id say they actually perform outrageously well but more importantly theres a really meaningful distinction between eliminating all accidents ever and drastically reducing the number of accidents no reasonable person would argue that self driving cars will never make mistakeshave glitchescause accidents but id straight up bet anything on their ability to outperform humans by orders of magnitude even as they exist right now much less after five or ten years
123,as sad as it is the autonomous cars main responsibility is the safety of its passengers it will make whatever decision it deems to be safest for the occupants in the car thats the only way to solve this problem unfortunately
124,agree with this their are huge legal and ethical barriers to removing a human operator who is responsible for the car another thing to add to your list is how autonomous cars will balance the safety of other road users pedestrians and its occupants simply comparing bulk numbers of people injured and killed wont work is it ethical to sell a car that would potentially endanger you by swerving away from a group people in the road should the car being more willing to swerve away from pedestrians in a potentially dangerous maneuver if you are the sole occupant
125,this exactly there was a recent cyclist killed by a tesla a lot of people saw that and went see self driving cars are not safe but the problem isnt wether or not theyre safe its wether or not we can trust the manufacturer to take responsibility or even be honest when the accident was caused by a lapse in the autonomous system
126,i agree i suspect of the legislature mandated some no fault no recourse insurance pool that individuals contributed to it might resolve the issue but right now its dangerous territory for manufacturers
127,they certainly do and that often involves large and complicated lawsuits and recalls as im sure you are aware but extending it to ai technology that makes driving decisions is a big expansion of liability
128,i get the feeling we will start paying insurance to the car manufacturer and that will pay for servicing and crashes that or everyone will start to rent cars
129,evidently you have never seen a cascading failure of engineering design also moving from cars dont kill peoplepeople kill people to cars kill people is a slippery slope and essentially requires providing a new level of corporate responsibility non responsibility is there really going to be a way to check that the car caused fatality isnt deliberate or due to undisclosed software hardware bugs like a volkswagen emissions scandal for self driving cars
130,but who is at fault then say for whatever reason the car screws up and injures someone nowadays if you are at fault then you ideally have insurance then your insurance pays and your premiums go up however if its the cars fault who pays is it still your car insurance or is it the manufacturer of the car if its your car insurance that is kind of wrong because it isnt your fault the car screwed up
131,exactly hit the brake controlled stop no choices anyone who is hit will probably be illegally crossing the road anyways and the car companies arent liable for other peoples high levels of stupid as long as they follow the traffic laws
132,its not going to do that though if someone steps into the road itll brake maybe itll still hit but most importantly for the automaker they wont be liable the trolley example is a horrible example because we already have rules for this on the road and the cars will follow the same rules brake dont swerve unless the roadway is clear the machine will minimize damage but its not going to choose between the mom and baby that illegally stepped into the road and the twenty year old driving in the oncoming lane or the old man on the sidewalk its going to hit the mom at the slowest speed it can and call before the mom and baby have hit the ground and the difference will be the mom and baby are more likely to survive because of machine reaction time
133,id rather no one drive on the roads well we cant just have everyone driving on the side walks thats just irresponsible
134,dont worry theyll find some way to push that liability on to consumers as they always have worst case scenario they just subcontract it to a corporation designed specifically to deal with such issues thats a legal stone you cant squeeze blood from you think musks lawyer army didnt figure this out long before they installed their first ai driving tech
135,i understand and am responding to what you wrote a human must take active responsibility because of a dangerous situation once every which means with no human interaction there would beon the extremely limited dataset of the technology of today which is also getting better with every mile drivenone accident however ive years of drivingwith federal government trainingand i have to take constant action to avoid accidents in situations created by other drivers and other drivers are not getting better they are getting more numerous therefore if a human only has to take correction once every miles that means there is less opportunity for humans to screw it up when called upon to do the right thing now imagine a world in the near future where there is a greater percentage of automated cars which reduces the ratio of better drivers there will be less accidents and less incidents for with the cars will have to respond ergo a safer experience your figures support that conclusion
136,self driving cars will really completely change how we deal with car insurance what might end up happening is people buy insurance for their autonomous car and if an accident does happen insurance pays for it and life goes on nobody is charged more since the risk of that particular car getting into another accident is not increased it stayed the same relative to every other autonomous car on the road that particular cars risk of getting into another accident has not changed since every car would ideally have the same programming were still thinking of insurance in terms of who to blame in an accident but when autonomous cars come around they arent going to be making the same mistakes as human drivers if an accident does happen its almost of the time going to be due to something out of the control of any one car the simplest way to handle insuring a vehicle that simply cannot have at fault accidents is just to pay a flat rate and when an accident does happen insurance pays for the damages for that particular car and moves on if there were multiple vehicles involved each vehicles insurance will pay for the damage on their particular vehicle now if an accident does happen that is at the fault of the cars programming that should be up to the software developer to deal with if a glitch in the cars programming causes the accident that developer is responsible for their own software if an accident occurred due to a poorly maintained vehicle that is the responsibility of the vehicles owner to deal with in that case their insurance provider could decide to raise their premiums because they have proven that they dont maintain their vehicle or they could require regular inspections or something like that

139,of course it will be your car insurance insurers are going to love self driving cars considerable less payouts overall for them
140,it is looking more and more like car manufacturers will be selling an insurance product for the vehicle they sell the insurance industry is not actually prepared for the changes coming their way
141,people say this but the reality just isnt with it people want reliable transport at their doorstep what youre describing is a taxi with a subscription service its been possible for decades but its not what people want because the convenience is in having the car then and there none of this wait half an hour for an available car because we fucked up how many we thought we would need in your area at this time
142,youll be able to opt out but it will be more expensive higher insurance and more strict licensingregulation expensive is subjective tho theres plenty of money to go around right
143,i wouldnt be surprised if insurance companies tried to pull some stunt like that however acts of god are actually in the contracts for a good reason they are supposed to eliminate coverage for things that affect many people at the same time no insurance company could possibly bunker enough money to handle such situations and if they could it would end up costing significantly more money for the policy holder so a single accident should not fall in this category now if an unexpected solar storm hit causing equally unexpected faults in the driving software and tens of thousands of accidents all happened at the same time that would be the traditional act of god
144,insurance companies should just go away at this point as we wouldnt need a middleman we should all just pay into a govt fund that then pays out to peoplefamilies injured in accidents involving ai vehicles at standard rates of course so lawyers can go away too as im thinking about it if we just had govt healthcare we would already be paying into a fund that takes care of injuries so maybe we should do that first and get rid of health insurance companies right away too then the fund would just compensate people for lost workpainsuffering ugh im thinking more now wait but compensated why i was born with a genetic defect as a result of bad luck so im not compensated for anything by anyone why should a bad luck victim of a car crash where nobody is at fault and there was no intent to harm be compensated
145,i doubt that very much self driving cars are going to put insurance companies across the country out of business
146,im gonna have to chime in here as i feel i have enough experience to speak in this acts of god are included under insurance policies most comprehensive claims are considered acts of god weather animals falling objects etc it appears you may have misunderstood what an act of god is or you need to look into a different insurance company
147,lots of people just need something to hang on to in the belief they are actually better than a machine at driving and hide behind the convenient trolley problem to claim superiority they dont want to become outdated and inferior because in reality most accidents will happen because of inattentiveness intoxicating not following rules and do intuitive but fatal reactions humans will somehow make the car skid sideways and kill both the blind man and the child admitting were going to be outclassed is hard well until some insurance company somehow figures they can get the same settlement uber had to pay for any car accident with the excuse you are suppose to be better than a machine and causing an accidents will bankrupt you
148,they have no legal means to the driver isnt the one making the decisions the ai is the level of risk would be the exact same between any driver on the road provided the ai is standardized which would certainly be ideal the only reason insurance prices could fluctuate between drivers is because of vehicle value and vehicle condition a car costs a lot more to repair than a car so obviously they would pay more in insurance if someone isnt properly maintaining their car then they might also be forced to fix their car or pay more in insurance since an improperly maintained vehicle is at a higher risk of malfunction
149,my insurance included an act of god clause because i had full coverage i actually had my car totaled by a tree while at church and it was considered an act of god that a tree fell on my car so its a thing and has legal meaning
150,thats what you have redundant sensors for aircraft parts are fly to fail because when one fails you have a backup if you have redundant sensors in the car then as soon as one goes out the car will auto drive itself to a maintenance location within x hours tbd timeframe based on reliability studies for sensor life you drive yourself to the hospital when one eye is blinded because you dont expect your second eye to go blind in the next half hour
151,i have a couple friends in the homeowners insurance adjustor business public adjustors a couple times they were called after insurance companies tried to pull the act of god thing and the way they explained it to the homeowners was that unless you can get god into the courtroom to confess it was his doing its not an act of god the insurance companies ended up paying up without going to court in both cases so i cant say whether or not that argument holds up in court its possible it does indeed have legal meaning and that these claims met that legal meaning but they wanted to avoid the expense of going to court
152,or that the church isnt responsible for the actions of god
153,rokos what idk what that is and its a real shame ill never know in fact i am completely uninterested in investigating this concept any further and therefore logically cannot be held liable for anything regarding it
154,its just a tragic accident at that point may as well make the parents responsible for not keeping track of their child
155,rationally insurance rates should drastically drop after self driving automobiles prove to be faultless in auto accidents something tells me however big insurance will still be outrageously overpriced
156,this is really scary but its actually really good press for tesla they can wash their hands of any liability they have because they tell drivers to be ready to take the wheel when you put the liability on the consumer this is what you get i foresee this happening more an more and it will only be viral marketing for tesla
157,i promise every time i see a car with a sleeping driver i will pull in front of their lane and slam on the brakes they deserve to be jolted awake by a brake check own your responsibility
158,our insurance agent retired and we sat down with the new one this conversation got brought up she had come back from a seminar where this was covered and she said the insurance industry doesnt see autonomous vehicles without a driver coming for at least years and likely longer and for auto drive vehicles right now one of the hard standing points right now is that a driver must be present and be able to take the controls so no lack of steering wheel vehicles either no sleeping and no inebriation
159,why do so many tesla drivers seem to think their car was driving autonomous its assisted driving only idiots like that guy should be fined big time for endangering others his insurance company should also be informed and raise his monthly fee
160,tangential rant ill never understand this belief that this is where self driving cars are heading yes obviously this guy shouldnt have done this planes have a much better level of autopilot with fewer outside variables but there no point during the flight where its ok for the pilots to both be asleep i cannot ever see insurance companies saying yeah its fine if people sleep at the wheel if the ai somehow fails well cover it the responsibility is always going to be shifted to the driver and itll likely be oh well you were asleep when it failed so youre liable

163,and then people blame tesla when this irresponsible person has an accident
164,i wish people would focus less on the idea of how it will be awesome to take car naps and more on the fact that the car manufacturer has put out an obviously unsafe feature yes obviously the guy who fell asleep is to blame and is most likely a complete idiot but responsibility isnt something that theres only a finite amount of and whilst this guy had a responsibility not to fall asleep at the wheel the manufacturer has a responsibility to not release features that will lead to unsafe use
165,i know it is the future but i will lament the loss of freedom and responsibility it causes driving is a privilege that should push the young to excel i will be sad when it is gone but then again i only have a min commute its different for the big city folk
166,the liquor trade has successfully convinced everyone that it bears absolutely no responsibility for the massive problems its product causes society and people already drive drunk in massive numbers people take million drunk driving trips a year in the us alone and drunk driving is responsible for a third of all highway fatalities drv_factsheethtml

168,when theyre reliable enough to do it sure
169,soon there is a lot of time still to go tons of testing with many parties including various government agencies and insurance companies theres half a dozen or more agencies that have to do their work and inspections and they havent even started yet our insurance agent retired and we sat down with the new one this conversation got brought up she had come back from a seminar where this was covered and she said the insurance industry doesnt see autonomous vehicles without a driver coming for at least years and likely longer and one of the hard standing points right now for auto drive vehicles is that a driver must be present and be able to take the controls so no lack of steering wheel vehicles either no sleeping and no inebriation when it comes to truckers good fucking luck between regulations and unions thats going to take even longer than normal vehicles we still dont run fully autonomous trains on preset tracks in the us without engineers
170,absolutely not happening at least not for awhile while the government hasnt had their say yet and when they get their hands on for testing with the dot that will be years worth of decisions and testing but right now insurance agencies are fully sticking to vehicles must contain a driver in a control seat and such drivers must be able to take the wheel at any moment that means no sleeping and no inebriation
171,no no no no no this kind of shit should never be the norm ever you dont let a pilot fall asleep with nobody else at the helm even though the plane can fly itself and said plane is thousands of feet above and away from any telephone poles or people or other such things it could strike because if things go wrong the computer cant be trusted to save the aircraft see the max as stinging and recent proof for how these systems can go wrong a car is in a far far more treacherous environment than an aircraft so its driver should always be alert of their surroundings regardless of what autopilot or self driving capabilities it has you know what forms of local transport remove all responsibility from you allowing you to sleep or play games or whatever buses trains or planes if you have to go farther take those instead if they arent available make your city invest in them theyre better for the environment than personal transport too talk like this makes me resentful of self driving car advocates because it basically says i want all the benefits of mass transportation combined with all the excess and waste of personal transport its a stupid stupid reason to want self driving technology
172,he may not have chose to sleep weve all fell asleep at the wheel at some point i guess and driving a vehicle will make to try very hard not to if you dont have the same burden of responsibility to stay awake then my guess is you end up sleeping like this guy hell ive even fell asleep riding a motorbike and i nearly died from that who would have though that was even possible if youre tired enough it will happen
173,the liquor trade has successfully convinced everyone that it bears absolutely no responsibility for the massive problems its product causes society and people already drive drunk in massive numbers so what exactly do you expect the industry to do people have been drinking alcohol for thousands of years many wineries breweries and distilleries have existed for hundreds so pretend that im barone ricasoli a winery in tuscany since ad locals have had my product with their evening meals for centuries suddenly the automobile comes along and some of them start to drink and drive whats your brilliant solution to this problem that helps me and helps the people who want to drink my wine that no government in the world has thought of yet
174,tesla is going to be the one to take the fall for it tesla may be take the fall as far as liability is concerned but it could set back self driving cars in general significantly
175,no and i hate to just go straight flamewar on someone but shut up and stop condoning people hacking their cars to sleep on public highways saying ridiculous things like robots can drive better than people is a childlike fantasy tale and no current tech or law should have anyone anyone tesla or not running around doing hack overrides of their cars safety features so that they can sleep while they drive this is so infuriatingly irresponsible and only undertaken by the biggest selfish turds who are trying to use a shared dangerous space to create viral youtube content to go viral on reddit there are hours of the day that you can sleep that dont involve going to bed for a useless minute nap while stunt driving on the sole road tens of thousands of people are using to get on with their lives who are not distracted and have to deal with someone next to them who is literally asleep just like we dont let jeff gordon guzzle jack daniels while going mph even though he won a bunch of nascar races the tech will be cool thats it right now its not and thinking anyone anywhere has the right to pull these behaviors is gross selfishness
176,this has nothing to do with automated trucking this has to do with someone intentionally falling asleep in their luxury sedan and being praised online by irresponsible idiots who dont care about public safety one is an acute danger involving attempts at shilling viral content online one is a macro concern
177,also considering the very small amount of self driving car on the road why do so many of the drivers fall asleep on the wheelat least thats what it looks like so does that mean they would all be dead if they drive a regular car i know people are excited to see something from their dreams in real life but thats not always good these cars are still in the very early stage and if one of these cars crashes in a horrible accident because of distractedsleeping driver people are automatically going to blame the manufacturer when its still their responsibility to drive and be aware
178,love it big insurance will fight it to the death instead of evolving with it and actually promoting safer transportation
179,this makes sense in the abstract but for lots of people it would already be cheaper to take taxis everywhere rather than have car paymentsgasmaintenanceinsuranceparking costs and yet people prefer to own a car nonetheless
180,some questions where will all the cars go when theyre not in use as you probably know car use is a bell curve with highest utilization rates around morning am ishand evening pm ish so when the united states needs million cars on the road at am well still have rush hour traffic but where will those cars all go during off peak times if there are no longer parking lots people still need garages maybe well have smaller ones but you need a place for bikes scooters maybe storage or an easy way to bring groceries into the house maybe this will transform somehow but im guessing people will still like garages in the future and houses without any garage will still be less desirable with more cars on the road roads will become more congested i know self driving will likely allow more throughput and hence more cars on the road at a time but with cars going all over a city like taxis or buses in nyc i think this would clog up the streets making the idea of living closer in still desirable there could be close to double the cars on the road as for every mile a car drives with a passenger it needs to travel back from the commercial districts to the residential districts empty streaming a car wont be that much cheaper than a taxi is today at least in big cities taxi drivers for example are often immigrants and actually make about minimum wage so maybe half of the cost of the fare goes to the driver the other half goes to maintenance gas credit card processing insurance depreciation or rental of the vehicle etc to replace a minimum wage driver can take expensive tech obviously self driving will be cheaper but not dramatically cheaper maybe of the price of a taxi would be my guess it will certainly not be the cost of owning a car thats for sure poorer people will continue to prefer public transport such as busses and subways this doesnt displace that the streaming service you describe will be a premium service to start with as for people that are just wealthy enough to buy a car owning a car can be as cheap as k per year plus all the other additional costs like gas and maintenance being the primary two that dont really decrease per mile driven and could increase slightly also without parking lots vehicles need to use more gas and will have more wear and tear to get back to its base or docking station so a new kia that leases for per month today would cost more if self driving tech were added in addition to self driving tech the vehicle would need to have better communication tech and there would need to be a backbone of maintenance guys to change tires or fix various issues that can happen and a used kia would cost even less i cant do the exact math on this because it is too complicated but overall im not saying it will be a little cheaper in some situations but it wont necessarily be that much cheaper
181,unfortunately in order to have a situation where there are virtually no accidents manually driven cars will need to be banned which is going to be a long long way off in addition roads will have to be in exceptional condition with markings painted properly in many parts of the uk where i live the roads are in such a terrible state that autonomous cars simply wouldnt be able to work unless someone comes up with a much faster and more accurate form of gps to avoid the need for markings to be detected by cameras sadly i dont think this fully autonomous car era will be seen by anyone currently alive today at least in the way were discussing where driver liability can be completely removed from the equation
182,my worry is that insurance companys will fight self driving cars until their last breath imagine reducing the number of crashes to virtually zero why would we ever need insuranceand if an accident were to happen it would be the manufacture who should cover because its their driving system
183,next round of car safety features will include things like the inability to tailgate change lanes within a certain distance of another car and only being able to drive over the speed limit for limited periods insurance companies will be behind it but youll have legislators talking about public safety and using accident stats as reasoning
184,agreed i edited my comment to clarify i am not condoning this drivers irresponsible and selfish behavior
185,why would they bother if the system is in place and the driver has intentionally bypassed it its no longer teslas problem responsibility is already on the driver beyond any reasonable doubt and whos responsible for what is what this is all about
186,why would they bother if the system is in place and the driver has intentionally bypassed it its no longer teslas problem responsibility is already on the driver beyond any reasonable doubt and whos responsible for what is what this is all about
187,how do you know i speed its heavily implied in your original comment that you wouldnt want a self driving car because it wouldnt speed when you wake up late for work and my minute drive needs to be even if you dont speed youre effectively saying that speeding is ok by what you said thats a really really stupid reckless thing to be saying because its blatantly not true no you shouldnt speed no i have never sped no self driving cars wont speed because they shouldnt because speeding fucking kills people you needing to be somewhere fast doesnt justify you endangering lives the rules are there for a reason fuck your personal reasons youre putting lives at risk every time you speed and i hope you get your license taken away if you do if you got up late thats your own stupid fault fix your alarm or get a better one you cant endanger others to save your own ass selfish grow up and take responsibility for the mistakes you make rather than endangering others house on fire thats what the fire brigade is for youre not gonna fight the fire yourself nor will you get there in time call and drive at the speed limit same with the school shooting are you picturing yourself going in and saving the day vigilante style get over yourself you cant save anyone in time by the time you got word of the shooting then the drive to get there even if you speed it will be over call drive at the speed limit labour takes hours to complete assuming your wife makes it to the hospital well before you even if the contractions start and you dont get notified for a whole hour you still have a minimum of about hours to make it sometimes it can last up to hours youre in no rush youll make it in time drive at the speed limit in all of these situations youve mentioned you either dont need to speed or you should have left earlier if you get a speeding ticket its deserved and your fault you dont deserve to drive if you cant respect the rules they are there for a reason
188,worked in insurance for years made it to lower senior management in two global corporations and have a diploma in insurance really im a totally interesting and swell guy who absolutely didnt own several different shades of grey suit honest im going to say on this one that i disagree an insurance company is in the business of lowering risk exposure against premium charged in order to increase their profit margin essentially the less they have to pay out the better sometimes they do this with good advice to the customer based on their knowledge of what likely causes of loss are particularly type of door lock or burglar alarm works better they will advise you fit it and can lower your premium accordingly they know with those youre less likely to have a loss and they get to keep more premium across the pool of risks they insure every year anyway currently to insure a car they have to assess individual drivers ability lifestyle carelessness decision making skills location commute type of parking level of car usage type of use and experience some they can ask you some they can use big data to figure the trends but in a lot of cases they simply cant know as much about you as you know about you so their premium charged has to guess and factor that in i worked on multiple books of motor insurance that had a combined operating ratio money in verses money out of over you need less than to be making money and these were the big insurance companies with the really good systems low operating costs internal efficiencies and damn good actuaries in the uk the motor industry lost money every year for over a decade i dont know the stats these daystheyd make up for it in other areas for an insurance company where in the uk it is compulsory for a driver to have at least third party liability to cover you damaging other things or people theres simply a lot of stuff that you the driver could do that they cant account for in their numbers but will have to pay for if you screwed up but an automatic car not owned by an individual but by company trying to run a profit themselves with known software and hardware combinations known and predictable use cases secure storage facilities regular maintenance and user feedback reporting and a large data set provided by the company themselves that reports all incidents and not just the ones that the drivers do actually report thats going to lead to a much more predictable loss data set and you have a company to sue when it goes wrong suing a regular person for the money they dont have can be a hiding to nothing so the way i see it insurance companies cant wait to get their hands on the business model of automated drive and fleet pool car operations where the unknown human element is a much more manageable in the insurance press its been a topic of discussion for years with some people actually thinking the biggest resistance wont come from the insurance companies but from the population resisting having their freedom to drive taken away from them and from governments that will be slow to unpack the current insurance legislation and open it up to allow innovation in the market the insurance companies want more money for their shareholders they often do it by slicing the back end operation which i in operations hated them for it made people their own staff have worse quality lives all so the shareholders could benefit paying less in claims is a much much more lucrative option and may even stop them for a while from carving into themselves for the extra cash i think they want the automation they wont resist it its way too much good money

190,love it big insurance will fight it to the death instead of evolving with it and actually promoting safer transportation you have it backwards insurance pushes more car safety than government because it saves them money they dont ever lower their rates so self driving cars with virtually no accidents will be a profit windfall
191,big insurance will fight it to the death no theyll love it youll still need insurance for cars but with fewer crashes it would mean more free money for them sure some competition between car insurance companies but they will stay profitable theyll only start whining once the system changes completely and we really end up abolishing the need for car insurance when they are actually going to be obsolete
192,why would insurance be through the roof on a car that never crashes i work for an insurance agency and my boss thinks that auto insurance as an industry is about to get squished by autonomous vehicles removing the need for any kind of liability coverage maybe year to protect from vandalismnature otherwise whos going to hit you who are you going to hit no coverage needed kthnxbye
193,why would insurance be through the roof on a car that never crashes i work for an insurance agency and my boss thinks that auto insurance as an industry is about to get squished by autonomous vehicles removing the need for any kind of liability coverage maybe year to protect from vandalismnature otherwise whos going to hit you who are you going to hit no coverage needed kthnxbye
194,insurance rates being insanely more expensive once its proven that autopilot mean way more safety and less accidents will put an end to that
195,the biggest resistance wont come from the insurance companies but from the population resisting having their freedom to drive taken away from them i can totally see this happening especially in the us where people very strongly link car ownership with freedom our cities are built to basically require access to vehicular transit and its extremely limiting to not have it and its so stupid if i had a self driving car service id have to change nothing about my lifestyle as i age and my vision starts to deteriorate and my hearing fails and my reflexes just stop being what they used to be and i wouldnt have to ever worry about sudden car related expenses which can be disastrous to people on fixed retirement income this seems like nothing but a win if you plan on ever getting old compare to the number of elderly people in the us who end up trapped just existing in their homes because they cant drive anymore
196,i can see how modded interiors for self driving cars would be useful but with everything becoming subscription based and ownership giving way to rental its the only part of you take on the future that makes me hesitate personally id rather have a self driving car that i own over time and especially depending on the fees of such a service buying a car could be more cost effective based on my car payments i currently pay per day towards paying off my car another on gas per day then maintenance if broken down per day is maybe a lot less lets say per day so basically i pay roughly per day for my car once car payments stop and i fully own it that number is halved i wont count insurance or tolls as that may not be a huge concern in the self driving future my question is how much would a subscription car service cost i know a train ticket from my house to new york city near where i work is per day though monthly passes are available for per day so assuming a self driving car service exists it will probably be more than a train fare due to the convenience factor but must be less than a car payment gas lets say per day not bad but i still think the convenience of accessing my stuff outweighs the cost of renting a car every day and i think thats why a lot of people drive rather than take public transportation
197,fuck no we all cant at least i cant and i know others are like me maybe if i was in first class with some provided xanax with the legroom ive been on intentional flights too and just cant do it if they make cars that are private it wouldnt be half as bad especially if those cars at the concept with four seats facing into a middle area like a limo section if self driving is very reliable i see that being pretty normal or somewhat normal
198,me personally id rather have the freedom of driving myself even if it meant an increased chance of death or injury i know that seems silly to some but the fun and satisfaction i get from driving would outweigh the risk true that a self driving car would have prevented the accident sooner but i still prevented it if i couldnt have fully it would have just been a very survivable accident with little to no injury only a moderate fender bender the wrong doer would have benefited more than i because i saved her from hundreds if not thousands of costs in damages and insurance by stopping in time on top of that i felt like a fucking legend after the adrenaline wore off and very proud of my actions or reactions i should say i mean ive avoided accidents before but this one was on another level also how much do you reckon mandated self driving cars would cost certainly not everyone that can afford to drive a car today can afford one its gonna be hard fought to outlaw driving unless its an autopiloted vehicle again i agree with your take on ap cars but the world be live in today thats not readily attainable for most if it were that driver would have never made that illegal u turn unless they disengage ap and manually took over
199,guys what are you doing this is a bullshit puff piece written and paid for by the r street institute a republican and libertarian free market thinktank and media organization theyre clearly trying to slow the adoption of self driving cars for monetary reasons look at the authors http http theyve never written for slate before and are both from the r street institute the board of directors of this group includes steve mcmanus vice president counsel state farm insurance bob inglis executive director energy and enterprise initiative tevi troy president american health policy institute and is funded by pfizer amgen lkq credit union national association glaxosmithkline bayer verizon the wisconsin insurance alliance bbt pepsico farmers insurance group eli lilly usaa nationwide mutual insurance co renaissancere xl group allied world assurance co state farm diageo abir and general motors several of whom stand to lose big with the adoption of self driving cars these guys all got in a conference room and said to each other what can we dredge up about self driving cars which will look bad in the media thankfully this is the best theyve come up with so far
200,in other news arent we super close to d printing vital organs for transplants anyway on mobile so no link less vehicle deaths more organ transplants everyone wins except insurance companies
201,theres a lot of unforeseen things that driverless cars will bring i have two friends who work in injury and insurance law they say of their cases are car accidents expect push back from sociopaths whod rather pad their pocket than save thousands of lives
202,it will do more than that heres a map of the most popular job by state medianprorgassetsimgscreen shot at pm_wide ddbbdabcdedeefbdpng s self driving cars are tier one disruptive technology the likes of which we havent seen since the dot com boom many towns only exist because they get a stable stream of money through their truck stops there are million professional truck drivers in the us with roughly million in the workforce this alone threatens to almost overnight increase unemployment by or in other words it would go from to but if anything that understates it an additional work in the commercial shipping industry whose jobs are also at risk along with a large number of taxi and bus drivers millions of small time businesses depend on commercial shipping and the humans doing it to sustain themselves emts police and other emergency workers would see decreased demand along with insurance workers we often talk about jobs being displaced by technology but usually that hasnt been the case when horseless carriages showed up buggy driving as a career went away but new jobs popped up but this represents a rare tangible threat that will end jobs without the potential for new growth overall self driving cars are a huge net positive but like globalization it comes with large localized downsides that require vision and leadership to overcome a proper redistribution system would smooth out the peaks and valleys of both mitigating most of the problems they create
203,if only the organ donor registration was easier i know lots of people who want to be organ donors but the registration process is not complicated im sure some states have it easier than others oh and of course we have those religious nutjobs who say their religion doesnt allow them to donate their organs those religions that say things like that are directly responsible for many lifes that could have been saved i live in an area where i am surrounded by people whos religion tells them not to
204,if demand gets that high they could start selling extreme sport and manually operated vehicle insurance the cost your organs when you die and maybe like admin fee
205,i actually would have thought it was even more than in i always assume that tragic accidents were responsible for over half since those people would have more healthy in life than someone who died of a chronic disease
206,this is one of the most wonderful unintended consequences ive ever encountered you know who else is going to be hurting from this the funeral industry also automotive repair emergency rooms local law enforcement derived city revenue and both automotive insurance and personal injury lawyers bring on this brave new world i say my boss who i really loved and admired was killed in an mva in september she had stopped along with all traffic in her highway lane as a result of a fender bender several cars ahead of her and another vehicle ran into the back of her at high speed
207,i have a theory most of my friends think im nuts but if they can be programmed to pick to hit a dog rather then a human what will stop them from hitting the guy with type o who hasnt paid his life insurance
208,basically the only response to this should be promoting getting more people on the organ donor list theres really no objective reason to not be an organ donor being an organ donor is basically like buying free life insurance except the payout is life instead of cash
209,i am all for progress not progress that robs every citizen of its money uber has the credit cards numbers of millions of citizens it charges whatever they want and like whenever drivers they fluctuate unfair payment to drivers no insurance no benefits no maintenance fee is paid for the vehicles ford declared million in sales last year providing jobs worker welfare and basic a well being amongst it employees well being a good family life is what all of us is here for ubertakes your money
210,the reason we have an organ shortage is because its illegal to sell organs wed have a food shortage if it were illegal to charge for food too so why would organs be any different if we legalized markets in organs there would be a number of benefits probably lots more people would sell kidneys and thus everyone who needed a kidney could get one health insurance would presumably cover this extra cost so poor people who needed kidneys would still get them people who needed money could get some by selling a kidney families of deceased people could get some extra money by selling the organs of their deceased relatives rather than just donating them or more likely just buryingdestroyingwasting them living people could get extra money for nothing by just agreeing that their organs could be taken after their deaths selling organs is one of those things that sounds icky but when you think about it theres really no good reason to oppose it thats why a pretty large majority http kidneys of economists agree that kidney markets would be a good idea iran has a somewhat legalized kidney market and they have no waitlist for kidneys
211,i am on the transplant waiting list for a kidney for the second time in my life and very likely not my last my kidney failure was caused by a rare genetic disease where my own immune system attacked my kidneys beginning around the age of it is called dense deposit disease i would prefer than any life that can be saved would be however it can be saved i dont like the idea of this being referred to as an unintended consequence the intention is always to save as many lives as possible there are lots of different potential treatments on the horizon for esrd im personally looking forward to when we can produce an organ for a patient that cannot be rejected thereby eliminating the need for immunosuppressive medication these medications often create a whole host of other issues such as an extensive list of side effectsresulting in using medication to treat the side effects and increased chance of catching other diseases and illnesses during the time with my first transplant that didnt last long due to some of the aforementioned complications i got bk virus normal immune systems are exposed to this but know how to handle it shingles norovirus twice within a month and several other issues too plentiful to list now all in the short two years i had it to me the real solution is not more organ donors but instead more reliable treatments that provide a long term solution that does not require multiple transplants over the course of ones life i know people who are working on transplant number three or four
212,at this stage of self driving development they are simply being overly optimistic about its reliability but in time when in actual use there will likely be enough equipment malfunctions and software glitches to maintain the supply of human organs from chauffeured victims
213,i think that the day where manual labour is taken over completely by machines while corporate jobs are all practised from our very own homes through the internet thus making of all traffic unnecessary is closer by than the day where self driving cars could be considered remotely reliable
214,if its electric and self driving it literally costs me nothing to keep it besides the payment the insurance will be sitting cheap no recurring maintenance since there are only two moving parts i will own my own car its the leasing vs owning argument at the end i own something of value plus i do miles a year even at stupid low rates that will still cost a ton
215,every time someone posts this nonsense in this sub i have to assume they live in a big city where everything they need is within walking distance and they are so caught up in their own little world they have an inability to see the big picture nono its uber and lyft who will own a fleet of them and you will get rides in them for pennies on the dollar compared to todays prices first your assessment that it will be pennies on the dollar is so ridiculous its not even worth arguing but i am going to do it anyway its going to be more expensive not less the most obvious when was the last time a company lowered their pricing models because they got rid of the human element in fact how about any company lowering their established pricing models on anything in any industry for any reason you said pennies on the dollar that means that it is at the very least less than a standard rate so what you are saying is that a taxi ride thats what it is will now cost instead of even the most economically naive person could not possibly claim this with a straight face not as obvious from what i have read uber takes of the cut of each fare this mean they get for nothing more than hosting the app and creating the connection they do not own the car they do not pay for the fuel insurance or car payment so basically what you are saying is not only will uber charge less for the ride but they will also buy all the new automated cars pay all the fees cover all the maintenance insurance the responsibility and then lower the fee significantly right now as it stands with their cut uber etc are losing money a lot of money uber lost over two billion in so please explain to me how its going to be pennies on the dollar after they start picking up all the expenses that go with it at that point why would you want to own a car uber and lyft and all the other app services have existed since the automobile was invented they are called taxis there is literally no difference between a taxi and uber except one is legally licensed and regulated to do the work and is indemnified by an actual company the same reason not everyone rides in taxis is why people will still own cars whether they are automated or not this notion that everyone will have no issue calling up an automated car and waiting for it to arrive every time you want to leave your house work or the store is complete fantasy it works in a big city it doesnt work anywhere else i am in a suburb if i call a cab it will take at the very least minutes to get here this doesnt consider the fact that of the population goes to work at the same time they leave work at the same time they go to the grocery store the movies etc all in the same peak periods this means that there has to be an over abundance of vehicles or you have to ride share which would further hinder any time related needs and isnt in any way attractive to the average consumer a minute normal ride to a store to pick up some munchies turns into a minute thing with taxi rides this doesnt even touch the subject of where all these cars are going to be stored charged and maintained if everyone calls uber uber is going to need dozens of millions of cars if not hundreds of millions right now virtually every vehicle is in a garage a driveway imagine if uber needed thousand cars for just a small city in new york state where are they going to be stored how long will it take them to get to their call one last thing to keep in mind in terms of why every thing you do everywhere you go will be recorded good luck with that automated cars are frikin awesome cant wait to own one but they will not usher in a new age of non car ownership and taxi rides and they will not be cheaper there are literally other things i could list that blow everyones fantasy out of the water and you know them you just wont admit them

217,theres a lot of people that really just love to drive prices on manual vehicles wont plummet insurance for them however might
218,besides the payment right but when you amortize a k vehicle over miles its damn cheap insurance too cheaper than the car payment plus private insurance by a long shot and you dont have to worry about maintenance storage owning the right vehicle for the job quick run to the store vs ski trip vs home depot trip no recurring maintenance since there are only two moving parts even an electric unicycle has more than two moving parts while the engine work is easier the rest of the car drive train wheels and tires brakes still require maintenance its the leasing vs owning argument no it isnt when you lease the car youre still the only user theres no economies gained when you car share you get to divide out the capital costs over many users which means each of you get to pay less its a very different economic model
219,why do you think that insurance prices on non autodriving cars are going to be reasonable insurance companies are going to love self driving cars and hate the ones that dont
220,insurance will skyrocket not plummet
221,my mom wouldnt let me get a bike unless i put her as a life insurance beneficiary
222,if self driving cars are a safe as they are expected to be it wont take too long for insurance rates to reflect that owning a manual drive car could eventually become a relative luxury given that they should be vastly more expensive to insure
223,dont forget its popular for the poor not to get car insurance at all and just take the gamble with getting pulled over or having to pay a fine its ridiculously expensive as it is
224,shouldnt car companies bear the insurance though for self driving cars insurance companies for driver cars would probably be a race to the bottom for a while assuming they want people to have their service get locked in now for a low rate in the future
225,it will definitely be interesting to see how it plays out on the free market but it wouldnt shock me if insurance companies see lower cost insurance with much lower claims as too good a deal and try to gradually price out manual drive cars by raising their rates
226,so when an automatic car crashes who pays the insurance bill
227,self driving cars will never become prevelant until there are policies in place to address liability issues if a person gets hit by a car today the driver is held responsible what happens if someone is killed by a self driving car im not a lawyer but i imagine that the manufacturer would be held responsible in some way i cant imagine any company would be willing to take on that much risk

229,i think the biggest problem with autonomous cars are going to be hackers you really think auto mobile industry is going to provide top notch security i doubt it heck even multi billion dollar corporations like google cant keep them out another issue is accountability is it the driver or the car at fault when an accident occurs how would insurance work
230,so long as the manufacturer and not the owner is liable for the damage injury and death that their vehicles cause or fail by inaction to prevent unfortunately i predict a situation where the owners have to pay the insurance for self driving related damage as soon as the lawsuits start rolling in against a particular make or model the price of said insurance will skyrocket leaving the owners with a liability and the manufacturers in the clear busy selling full self drive now with less random swerving into cyclists to a new batch of suckers

233,i must disagree with the articles pronouncement of what we need to accept the burden is on the technology developers to clearly demonstrate that their design is better than the status quo enough better to justify the added cost in the earlier days of self driving cars there was a wholly unwarranted presumption on the part of many that self driving cars were going to be absolutely safe and the general public is slowly becoming educated on the limitations of the technology if you really understand how deep learning systems operate youll know that theyre a total black box that cannot be verified to operate properly by any manner of proof its been demonstrated that changing of even a single pixel can change object classification decisions its been demonstrated that pasting small images of other signs in the blank space of signs can cause them to be misrecognized because the black block deep learning recognizers are designed to read signs at a variety of scales in the recent uber case a software failure caused the perception of a pedestrian obstacle in the middle of the road to be effectively ignored all this technology is also going to cost money itll make cars more expensive but the ability to drive away from the destination enables cars to be shared which can greatly affect the actual cost of ownership the number of cars on the road and the occupancy and eventually the need for parking spaces nevertheless if the added cost of the technology isnt balanced by a decrease in the cost of killing and maiming drivers passengers occupants of other vehicles pedestrians and bystanders we should be highly resistant to accepting these products thats not to say its the way its going to happen people were so in love with their cell phones that they failed to resist the temptation to use them while they were driving exacting an extremely high cost in lives lost and injuries that persist to the present day users are paying the price of this in their automobile insurance cost but these costs are not redeemed by the companies responsible for the manufacture marketing or sales of cell phones so far cell phone makers havent been obliged to pay for a failure to make their products safe regulation has encouraged makers to add facilities for hands free use which has not yet been proven to make them safe to use while driving indeed studies to date suggest that users still become too cognitively occupied to safely operate a vehicle and a phone together current half driving cars on the market present another danger particularly given users penchants for operating them beyond the stated capabilities defeating safety systems such as by pressing an orange into the steering wheel and so forth theres been clear evidence that reducing the drivers workload with these systems makes the driver less attentive to the task rendering them unable to assist the half driver when it malfunctions or needs to pass control back to the driver unlike airplanes where there may be many seconds before an autopilot controlled plane becomes unsafe or uncontrollable the geometry of the driving task demands sub second responses to unusual conditions

235,i dont want a self driving car if im going to die in a car accident at least i want to be responsible for my own death rather than some random computer glitch lol
236,people are going to die at first get over it is probably not the greatest stance to take if youre trying to promote widespread adoption in order to flatten the learning curve for the driving algorithms when theres a perfectly viable alternative available that people have been using for years most people will be happy to say no thanks let me know when youve worked all the kinks out and then ill think about it even if they are statistically more safe in an autonomous vehicle the technology needs strong adoption because truly safe autonomous driving is going to require millions upon millions of miles driven so that nearly every combination of scenarios can be encountered and appropriately mitigated through software learning then theres the whole casualty insurance elephant in the room that no one seems to want to address
237,problem if a human driver kills someone theyre liable personally through their insurance if an autonomous car kills someone the car maker will probably assume liability that shifts the incentives with the risks and corporations are far more risk averse than people
238,problem if a human driver kills someone theyre liable personally through their insurance if an autonomous car kills someone the car maker will probably assume liability that shifts the incentives with the risks and corporations are far more risk averse than people
239,problem if a human driver kills someone theyre liable personally through their insurance if an autonomous car kills someone the car maker will probably assume liability that shifts the incentives with the risks and corporations are far more risk averse than people
240,so how is this going to work legally if youre texting or drunk behind the wheel and cause an accident you personally can get hauled into court if you hit a patch of ice through no fault of your own and slide into somebody your insurance in some places bites the bullet who pays the piper if your self driving car takes it into its little circuits to cross the median at mph and wipe out a family of in a minivan in the oncoming lane
241,even early iterations of aircraft auto pilot systems were pretty unreliable especially auto landing and ils
242,i agree but think a lot of laws need to be worked out soon who is responsible for any accident thats the ultimate question who pays for damages and do we convict the makers or the person who is behind the wheel what happens if it is a complete accident on all parts i remember reading some cars will put the safety of the occupants of the vehicle above all else as a luxury design to be sold almost like a safety feature that takes it as collateral damage cars like that should be highly illegal imo imagine if an automated car chooses to hit a person on the sidewalk because there is no other way to avoid a collision and save the occupants that in my mind is unacceptable morally right now human drivers are at the mercy of the human condition with the eventually increase of automation we can literally pre program ahead of time what we want to happen this is just one tiny facet of so many questions that will need to be answered
243,thats not the problem you dont see the bigger picture lets say you and your family are driving cross country in your brand new autonomous car you are nervous about it and keep an eye on it real close to see how well this car drives itself its doing great more watching still great all day hours of driving car and you keeping an eye on it its done amazing you fall asleep wake up to a jarring jolt car is stopped and lights are coming on you get out theres a person limping and alive but in hell shape who pays her medical bills insurance would cover it normally of course some investigating would be done but in this case the lady popped in out of no where does your insurance cover it if so why you werent driving the car drove itself so does the car manufacture cover insurance
244,no accepting that is absolutely the wrong approach and is most likely going to be an disincentive for those responsible given the recent experiences there is absolutely no reason to believe in self regulating tech companies
245,so when a self driving car is bound to crash into either a mom with a baby in a troller or a grandpa walking with his grandson how does it decide who to kill and who is responsible for that decision
246,i recently got into a fender bender that wasnt my fault and my insurance got hiked up for it i wonder how that will work when we arent the ones driving anymore
247,i think i car owners will no longer happen you will only have people who rent or lease the car from the manufacture the payment will include insurance and cost of regular maintenance volvo already has a program like this for a regular suv i think people will go this route and never own a car again at least a self driving car edit link for the volvo care program toolspurchasecare by volvo
248,sure but manufacturers still need to be held criminally and civilly liable
249,somebody has to be responsible when a human being is killed this idea that people will just shrug it off the way they would a person being killed by a bolt of lightning completely ignores that these cars are designed by companies for profit and operated by owners for convenience
250,i admit im concerned at this point on a strictly personal level i plunked my modest k down for the model specifically for the autopilot i work a lot at various locations and i was all over this technology until i read about the car hitting a damn fire truck at a standstill while in autopilot mode or however you want to word it company statement is basically we told you not to rely on autopilot well thats the only reason id spend the money on this car to begin with so if its not reliable im thinking i dont need it at this point it seems im still a better driver than what theyve got going i dont hit fire trucks at a standstill or people walking their bikes across the street im a very defensive careful driver i thought they were better i think ill wait until they are
251,i did my thesis on autonomous vehicle safety people gonna die traffic gonna be safer the only real focus is on who takes the blamepays out the cost auto maker blames the software company software company blames the car owner car owner calls the insurance company who says only the driver is covered well there was no driver so the owner gets to defend themselves against multi billion dollar companies
252,seems like the main issue is the car being responsible for the blame would it differ from industrial accidents where machinery killed the operator
253,though when self driving cars kill people will we still need auto insurance pretty sure the lawyers will go after that big money which will be auto manufacturer
254,sure but companies can be irresponsible like uber who disabled their emergency brake system because it was braking too much and tesla who came up with the name autopilot for what is essentially lane guidance cruise control semiautomatic braking
255,yeah no humans are actually excellent drivers incredibly good as long as theyre doing the actual driving and not fucking about have you ever seen pilots view from f or redbull air race shits insane and they very rarely crash absolute majority of road incidents are due to driver error if we remove the human from that seat then id expect all associated causes for a crash to go away with it i dont want an sdc thats safer than the average human because average human texts behind the wheel goes over the limit when its not safe to do so overtakes on blind corners etc i want sdc thats safer than a really good attentive responsible driver if they cant provide that well then i guess ill stick to driving myself
256,liability is the word here whos at fault people will die on the roads either way but theres a process in place to punish peoples carelessness far from perfect but it exists whos at fault when theres nobody in control
257,who should be held responsible though when this happens
258,less death is still death but its less death i dont know of any humans with ladar or super fast processing power that can avoid many accidents that a human wouldnt just cause some people will die doesnt mean we need to scrap the whole idea in the end if it causes fewer deaths than human drivers would thats saving lives as far as insurance why not everyone just have a low rate for their car based on historical accident rates for that model itd be a lot cheaper and much more acceptable since theres no way the automaker would take the blame
259,honestly this sub is kind of insane when it comes to this stuff this us the scariest thing ever not because of people dying in traffic but who is to blame who does the ethical responsibility for that decision test on the field of ethics has asked for centuries whose life is worth preserving in the railtrain scenario and now car producers just answer based on profit since nobody would buy a car that kills its driver it will always swerve into pedestrians to save the driver
260,basically a fair point the only reason theres any resistance at all is because now its big companies that can be held responsible for the failures directly instead of careless drivers
261,the problem is whos accountant for that accident right now it is easy since drivers have total control but even with this there are problems to get properly accountability so insurances can pay what ever needs to be apid so i dont wanna start thinking about the nightmare atuonomous drive will bring
262,it is a legal problem who is to blame our society is founded on personal responsibility
263,i think the real problem with avs is going to be when one does kill someone and someone now needs to determine was the av or the deceased persons more at fault if it is decided that it was the av who is responsible the owner of the vehicle or the company or companies behind the avs safety equipment which may be a lot more than just one company and this is with a simplified scenario depending on what the final technology requires what happens if external sensors or signal broadcasters are required by avs just to function reliably im thinking especially of snowy or icy conditions where the cars on board sensors may not be able to detect the edge or center of a road reliably right now roads and road signals are mostly paid for by the public if an av kills someone and it was icy and there is a question about whether some road implanted signaling device failed does that make that citycountystate partially responsible this is likely to provide for entirely new departments of lawyers being required in many legal firms to handle the increased demand for both prosecuting and defense lawyers
264,ya know whats even more reliable than self driving cars mass transportation railways but noooooo america has to invest in more fucking cars than anything remotely practical
265,as boring as it sounds there is a significant discussion currently being held in the risk management profession of moving liability in any auto accident to the actual manufacturer of an autonomous vehicle as opposed to the driver this would completely change the way personal auto insurance operates and therefore the profitability of auto insurance carriers
266,as boring as it sounds there is a significant discussion currently being held in the risk management profession of moving liability in any auto accident to the actual manufacturer of an autonomous vehicle as opposed to the driver this would completely change the way personal auto insurance operates and therefore the profitability of auto insurance carriers
267,im sorry sir your insurance states you keeping your car up to date and yet i can clearly see here you did not apply the v update released over a month ago no payout for you
268,that would be the question the insurance agents work with they have the telemetry from one car and the statements from the driver and possible witnesses and can work their way forward from there the same will happen when two autonomous cars hit each other or kill someone the only difference between having a human driving and a computer is that the computer remembers what happened and not an interpretation of what happened
269,i think that most people wont own self driving cars in the future but rent them perhaps like a subscription for the car so whatever company owns the vehicles can maintain them and keep the software up to date and such that or like a taxi service having just played through detroit become human i think they show the most accurate guess at the future of self driving cars where they are like taxis but you can still own and use cars you drive yourself but the self driving vehicles all work as taxis and buses so insurance isnt a problem for the average person its all on whatever company is running the vehicles
270,same as anything the owner is responsible they can then sue other parties the injured person goes after the owner and the owner should carry insurance
271,same as anything the owner is responsible they can then sue other parties the injured person goes after the owner and the owner should carry insurance
272,as someone who works in insurance as a liability adjuster the current stance is whoever the owner of the car is mainly because you choose to let a currently unreliable technology make the decision for you and thats on you
273,as someone who works in insurance as a liability adjuster the current stance is whoever the owner of the car is mainly because you choose to let a currently unreliable technology make the decision for you and thats on you
274,as someone who works in insurance as a liability adjuster the current stance is whoever the owner of the car is mainly because you choose to let a currently unreliable technology make the decision for you and thats on you
275,currently the laws are written to hold the personcompany choosing to put the vehicle on the road responsible for what happens with it that wont likely change any time soon
276,trick question entities pay the insurance bill before a crash the insurance makes payouts after the crash
277,better question is fault if an electric car strikes and kills someone who is responsible
278,interesting question that is not really relevant to the point automated vehicles will reduce the number of accidents to a value approaching zero dramatically reducing cost in dollars and lives the cost of insurance is going to go down by over time and youre worried about who is going to foot the bill
279,liability is troubling
280,a couple years ago all the big players in the self driving car business came forward one at a time and basically said they would self insure all of their own cars basically no car owner is going to be willing to own a self driving car if they would have to pay for its mistakes and theres a pretty good chance that even if individual people did sign up for that it wouldnt take many expensive accidents before the courts would start assigning damages to the car companies also transportation is one of the few areas in the us that still has relatively strong consumer protection regulations partly because the national highway transportation safety board has veto power over which vehicles get to use the highway and the nhtsb would insist on the manufacturers running the insurance im not positive how exactly the insurance is funded whether these companies are parking the risk with third party risk assessment companies for a smoother potentially lower price or if theyre just going to flat out pay any damages from the company slush fund
281,what they are also considering is to connect the insurance to the individual car and not the person such that a car which has made no crashes in the last years will get a cheaper insurance or a car from a manufacturer with cars with a great safety record will get a lower monthly fee
282,insurance companies will surely develop a new policy for that given that they are said to be safer than drivers they are therefore better for insurances it means more profit for them i predict there will be at least three kind of insurances for self driving cars the one were the manufacturer themselves become an insurer a car insurance where you are not allowed to drive the car which will be much cheaper than the cheapest one at the momentless accident means more money for the insurer a mix of both where you have a manufacturer insurance and a normal car insurance who is liable will depend on who was driving at the time of the accident

284,it should be like your home flooding whilst its not your fault your insurance should pay out for your own car premiums will be a lot less as well given lower risks and not dependent on the driver
285,in countries with sane insurance models the car itself is insured not the driver perhaps america can adopt this model too
286,the person who owns the car and pays the insurance
287,somewhat interesting question if the system stays as it is the insurance company covering your car would pay that is why you have insurance after all however they are probably not going to just eat those costs but will look to see if there is someone at fault that they can go after if the other party is at fault theyll go after them or more likely theyll figure it out with the other insurance company if the manufacturer is at fault they will probably go after them the question is will the system stay the same as i understand the state of things right now some manufacturers of self driving cars are looking to self insure i assume that they will also have some sort of umbrella insurance this would at least avoid embarrassing lawsuits brought by insurance companies perhaps someone knows a bit more about these self insurance plans and would be willing to share what they know
288,thats the thing the car is always watching and has a ton of video and data to pretty much recreate the accident to know who was at fault and im sure they have insurance just like any other vehicle
289,i would think the owner of the car would still be responsible if you get in an accident because your tire has a blow out its not the tire manufacturers who pay its the owner of the car
290,the car owner a dog bites someone the dogs owner is responsible
291,if tesla is ever going to be true autopilot tesla will partner with insurance companies and offer insurance directly to you with a guarantee that the premium wont increase after a crash caused by the autopilot if the tesla cars have much fewer accidents the insurance fee will be very low compared to that of non autopilot cars
292,you answered your own question and manufacturerssoftware companies can buy liability insurance
293,you answered your own question and manufacturerssoftware companies can buy liability insurance
294,how many people will die from reckless driving while we sit around trying to figure out liability of autonomous cars is it really better to have people die per year than have far fewer with less of a contingency plan for blame to that extent by accepting the current death toll in lieu of just rolling out driverless vehicles are we putting an actual pricetag on a human life
295,im not comfortable giving up control i cant imagine being at the mercy of an automated machine when it malfunctions as the person driving the malfunctioning autonomous car it would be horrifying to be powerless to stop an injury or fatality theres little that car companies care about besides making money if the predicted cost of liability in this transition period is relatively low compared to predicted company profits it will move forward with autonomous vehicles regardless of the moral implications a human driver has a much higher sense of moral obligation and would almost never choose to endanger others due to a financial cost benefit analysis i just hate to think that the reason for the deaths and injuries to come is one of monetary gain and greater good mentality
296,owners will pay for it regardless be it through insurance or increased costs for purchasing a car
297,my ex works programming self driving cars and what you are saying is a frequent topic of conversation in his office that most people including the ones working there arent willing to accept once theyve swallowed the self driving car kool aid self driving cars can really only ever be a safe reality in cases like garbage trucks where you have a pre planned route and a safety handler present shuttle routes on places like campuses which are a comparatively controlled environment enhanced cruise control like tesla and possibly services like uber where you would have a driver remotely controlling the car the idea that youre gonna have cars driving themselves all over the freeways is absurd as long as people drive in those roads theres just too many variables that make the self driving cars into an enormous liability however he thinks that might be the plan once everyone prefers self driving cars you could turn the highways into routes for the cars in the way few people can drive manual today few people will drive at all and just rely on this service and yea it will be a service people wont own cars anymore so self diving eliminates our autonomy and need to drive its amazing technology for some applications but not all
298,there is a good chance that you might die to some other humans mistake so you cant really control who is responsible
299,i do want a self driving car but i also want the appropriate person to aceept liability for an accident you cant just blame the victim you cant just refuse an insurance payout and if you built a self driving car your liability does extend to preventing the next victim from having the same accident in addition to that of depriving the victim of their life or property

301,while in most cases with non self driving cars one or more human drivers is responsible for a crash there are certainly cases where a car malfunction is the cause in such cases its still possible for the malfunction to be the drivers or owners fault a result of improper maintenance for example but if it can be proven that a faulty design is responsible the cars manufacturer can definitely be held liable for financial damages in a self driving car theres still a possibility that the driver may be held responsible due to their operation of the car or its maintenance so drivers may still need to be insured corporations certainly are risk averse but they can collect revenue from the sale that can be applied to the cost of liability insurance a safer self driving car will cost less for the manufacturer to lay off financial risks to an insurer we can only hope that arrangement stays in place so the public isnt forced to pay for the risks and costs of poorly performing self driving designs for example if manufacturers get government to hold them harmless for crashes in self driving cars the public will have to eat the cost either by driverowners insurance or people just plain not being compensated for being killed or injured

305,it is because the responsibility of driving and all the consequences spoken about in this article you know like killing someone is now the manufacturers it would be like saying that dying on a rollercoaster was the fault of the rider not the owner of the theme park
306,self driving vehicles will still have to be insured who directly pays isnt that important one way or another costs get passed along to the end user its not like carmakers are going to absorb the costs out of the goodness of their hearts every time you take a taxi or a bus or an airplane today youre literally paying for the insurance indirectly even though you werent drivingflying through a part of your fare its really nothing new
307,think about the layers of insurance that are going to be required to make this system viable and its not insurance for the passengers its massive liability policies for the companies that build and operate these fleets to protect their bottom line
308,think about the layers of insurance that are going to be required to make this system viable and its not insurance for the passengers its massive liability policies for the companies that build and operate these fleets to protect their bottom line
309,id assume that itd come down to the manufacturer assuming responsibility but with a million clauses that count as assuming manual control or whatever that would include things like roads under _ width or with _ variables where if there is a mistake it is your fault for taking the car there
310,so what youre saying is that itll become another manufacturing expense that gets passed along to the consumer insurance will still make their money gouging manufacturers and manufacturers will pass it along to the consumer with a bit of markup for their trouble what that means for the immediate future is that cars with autonomy features will be more expensive than they otherwise would as the roads adjust to having more autonomous vehicles and fewer humans and as autonomous vehicles get safer the rates insurance companies will have to charge to turn a profit will go down assuming regulators arent corrupted by the insurance lobby the amount they can charge the manufacturer will be capped and so the cost to the consumer will decrease commensurately basically itll have the same cost curve as a function of time as any other major technology thats inherently unsafe but also incredibly useful
311,correct manufacturers will be liable if the self driving car they made causes an accident of course this assumes full automation of the vehicle but it could still be before we see the majority of cars on the road being fully automated in semi automated cars there is still some role for the driver who could be held liable as a result of their actions regarding profitability id assume having contracts with manufacturers will be based on the number of vehicles they have sold meaning there will still be the same number of risks to pay for of course the pricing of these contracts may end up being less profitable than when it is done on an individual basis self driving cars also have high costs of repair due to the technology in one compared to traditional cars on the other hand if self driving cars cause less accidents there will be fewer claims and so it may cancel out
312,its officially the future tfw turning off automatic updates means im personally liable for when my car crashes into someone or when my car was pushed the automatic update to public_safety_protocol_v but the download cut off halfway through because my wireless carrier throttled my bandwidth midway through it and my car glitched in a school zone and hip checked a nine year old at mph
313,im afraid insurance companies dont work this way they wont bother to read telemetry for usual accidents nor they will be able to
314,right if all you needed was an id or social security card and they just have your insurance cause theres only one thatd be nice were starting to get closer to that i just got something in the mail that is off prescriptions no insurance required colorado
315,we have this in the uk its great but we do care who pays use of the system by non citizens is political attempts to verify eligibility are difficult because we dont have id cards thankfully also local trusts are allowed to allocate priorities so that there is a postcode lottery for access to some treatments variations in outcomes across the country but this is complicated because poor areas rich areas differ in so many ways private healthcare is legal doctors will often do private work after their nhs working day this has complicated effects upon the system patient outcomes its not obvious whether the overall effect is good or bad its not even obvious within the system whether going private is the best option advice can be conflicting because of politics as well as differences in clinical opinions so again it still matters who pays car insurance is a legal requirement in the uk which is sensible in theory but results in dysfunctional market behaviour with disproportionate costs for younger drivers i think that it should therefore be run as a government monopoly a national insurance service so that the risk is equally shared across the population the disadvantage of this sort of system is that it removes the incentive to reduce risk by eg buying lower performance vehicles with lower replacement value however most people have no more desire to damage their car than their health even if the government bears the financial cost so i think that the good outweighs the bad if healthcare car insurance are both provided by central government the savings associated with self driving cars are passed on to taxpayers rather than taken as profit by private industry which is probably a good thing because it may be argued that this will increase spending therefore growth more effectively
316,whatever so the insurance rate would be based on the likelihood of the program to fail and im paying that
317,ill be interested to see what happens with the cost of insurance i actually think it could go up on average as those without sdvs will be seen as a much higher risk and those with sdvs will eventually deem insurance unnecessary
318,my automatic golf cart runs into the side of your house causing a fire and worth of damage your question who pays for this my response to you thats not really relevant to the point here automated vehicles will reduce the number of accidents to a value approaching zero dramatically reducing costs in dollars and lives the cost of insurance is going to go down by over time and youre worried about who is going to foot the bill
319,im not sure i should have to pay insurance at all if im not the risk that potentially causes harm anymore
320,even if humans are better for now at certain driving tasks there are just so many kinds of distractions and flaws and reckless stupid emotions that automated cars arent capable of do you know how many possible things can go wrong while programming an automated car literally millions not to mention how will these companies stay afloat financially with deaths i hear the womens family in arizona was paid out a ridiculous amount of money by uber in the settlement what insurance company would like that i need to do more research but from my judgement this looks like an insurance nightmare waiting to happen it took within week of the first automated uber being in circulation car to kill someone
321,there is one implication thats not so attractive if the self driving car gets into an accident it will be you whos liable not the car and as someone who is very familiar with how autopilot works i wouldnt dare to read reddit on my phone while the car is driving
322,i agree and its not just reddit its the industry too a colleague went to a transportation conference and shared his experience with us almost everything was about autonomous cars with very little emphasis on public transit or how the tech can be applied to public transit networks in an ideal world id like to see the tech improve existing public transit with cars filling in the gaps that arent covered adequately like the person who commented about his shiftslocation in this thread its sad because i really believe that this tech can provide cheap reliable and efficient transportation with no reason for anyone to own a car but it seems like the focus is on everyone owning a driverless car that will sit in the lot of the time in other words how can we sell as many cars as possible
323,yes but the purchase price is a known factor that you can take into account during your decision to buy the manufacturer should know the risk of the system they have built and so have a basis for how much that liability will be for the life of the vehicle but theres zero chance of any consumer being able to independently evaluate that liability before or after purchase in the manufacturer pays case if a manufacturer is liable and understates the risk then their insurance provider will charge them more or refuse to cover it the consumer might lose some of the value of their car because they get a poor reputation for safety but in all likelihood it will be in the manufacturers best interests to remedy the problem asap as well as the consumers in the customer pays case the customers are accepting an unknown and unknowable amount of liability when they purchase such a vehicle the insurance premium could go through the roof they could effectively be rendered uninsurable and the only incentive for the manufacturer to fix anything is bad press or if they are forced into a recall

326,im actually pretty optimistic about self driving being safer than the average human but like any new tech we need to make sure its properly regulated and like any business model we need to make sure liability and profit are in the right places in order for the market to function to the general good there will be cases where a self driving car will kill someone that an alert human driver would not there will hopefully be a lot more cases where a self driving system will avoid a fatal incident that a distracted driver would not the former will be easy to measure and should be properly investigated the latter we will only be able to understand statistically that doesnt mean that we should give more weight to the former but it does mean that we need to carefully and continuously weight the costs and benefits of using such automation when competing implementations exist we need to ensure that the most financially rewarding option for manufacturers is to continually improve safety not to pass liability to blameless consumers or hide behind hard to measure statistics placing the liability for such incidents squarely on manufacturers is the only way to adequately incentivise the behaviour that we want to see
327,for some reason i enjoy the idea that if someone kills me and its their fault theres atleast someone responsible and potentially punished for what he did if some self driving tesla kills me im collateral damage for testing out software musk wont be responsible if that happens nothing will happen
328,this will be solved by selling cars as a service not a product you pay a monthly bill and the manufacturer will provide you with the car you cant modify it and they will do the maintenance and even replace the car regularly the manufacturer will be accountable for every accident and killing and they will hire the insurance
329,my father used to work on car insurance and even without that kind of in depth information just with seeing the cars involved hearing what happened he could tell what really happened he would know exactly how the accident took place and spot people lying one time my sister crashed and she wasnt able to describe the accident well my dad saw the car and immediately knew what happend explained it to my sister and she was like yeah that was it
330,machine learning will take care of insurance claims download data run its function out the claims
331,if you pay for the vehicle yes many companies have stated they assume responsibility but even then the price is built in do you expect to not pay for damages you cause
332,i doubt you can be liable if you loan your note to a friend and it explodes in their face
333,theres different auto insurance coverages though theres comprehensive collision medical payments liability etc i suspect the one most are posting about is the liability portion and its perfectly reasonable to assume the manufacturer will take that on while the owner will still maintain things like comprehensive which would cover the car if its sitting in the driveway and a tree falls on it

335,near chance insurance companies dont lobby to make sdv insurance mandatory paid by vehicle owner at least stateside chance insurance rates dont end up higher than now no matter what the insurance lobby is strong very very strong
336,somehow auto insurance companies will find a way to say with a straight face that self driving cars are more expensive to insure and traditionally driven cars are also more expensive to insure with self driving cars on the road alongside them that way auto insurance rates can continue to do what theyve always done
337,those with sdvs will eventually deem insurance unnecessary you will still want comprehensive insurance if youre afraid of being hit by someone else who doesnt have insurance
338,i actually think it could go up on average as those without sdvs will be seen as a much higher risk thats not how it works insurance is already priced to account for the risk of human drivers if any thing that risk goes down as there are more self driving cars on the road
339,bad argument is bad who pays for insurance is irrelevant to we need to accept imperfection because automated cars are many times safer than we are your question is about a very specific instance that has nothing to do with the article at all
340,the one assumption that was made in the title was that it would decrease accidents that means its better than the average driver insurance rates are based on those statistics so its not really dependant on how you drive yourself so youre rate will go down if you use their system because the assumption is that its really good you dont pay for a fuck up system because the system isnt fucked up if something happens where the car gets in an accident the insurance company will pay it
341,insurance companies already divide people into risk groups and charge different rates based on that
342,then you will be the worst driver on the road and your insurance will cost x what it used to and everyone will tell you and your kind to get the fuck off the road because your fucking up the program just like bike riders get
343,in my perfect dream of the future self driving cars come with insurance as part of the car the manufacturer programmed the car they are responsible for accidents and will make deals with insurers before the car is sold there may be a need for supplemental insurance for those who elect to drive the car themselves it may become normal routine in the future that the operating mode of the car during the crash will need to be determined to indicate which insurance policy will be used

345,why would this be true i would assume your insurer is liable or the car manufacturer or software vendor would be liable makes no sense for an individual to be personally liable for the actions of the software
346,that is not a resolved legal issue it could go the trainbus route of passenger liability in fact with level automation thats the only viable option
347,the problem really is that self driving technology will diffuse responsibility for deaths that it causes lets say that a self driving car kills someone and later its proven in court that if the programming had been slightly different the death wouldnt have occurred who is at fault for that do you blame the programmer what if its a team of programmers who all collaborated to write the software what if they were just programming the way the middle management told them to what if middle management was just trying to adhere to strict deadlines set by the ceo what if the ceo says he has to have those deadlines to fulfill his fiduciary duty to shareholders et al when an entire company is at fault the responsibility is diffused and the only real solution is that the company pays a settlement to the family of the dead this allows for companies to get away with murder if the settlements are less costly than improving their software
348,the real kicker is that it will actually jack up your manual insurance prices self driving cars cause less accidents and the manufacture is sued they will be pooled seperatly as more people use them there will be less people in the manual pool these people also have more liability as each death does not cost an insurance company the same amount an automated car can make a mistake but it cant be negligent negligence texting drinking etc cost more with fewer people pooling money to cover larger liabilities your premiums will skyrocket at some point choosing to manually drive could be considered a risky behavior as well as unsexy as it sounds rising insurance premiums will be the force behind the adoption rate of this tech

352,its a pretty meaningless distinction the insurance will pay who directly pays for the insurance is also pretty meaningless because regardless the cost gets passed along to the end user
353,it will be nobodys fault in practice car manufacturers will be releasing a financial report every year with one more line in it insurance payments
354,ya thats what i was thinking too these insurance companies are huge and basically print money theyre not just gonna roll over and start making a shit ton less money
355,why would the insurers care who pays them it could be the end user as a customer or a car manufacturer at any rate people will still need liability coverage natural disaster coverage theft coverage glass breakage coverage mechanical issues coverage etc
356,i get what you are saying but businesses are always expected to make bigger and bigger profits i can see prices for insurance of both sdvs and non sdvs will be disproportionate to actual risk so the insurance companies continue to make bigger profits
357,originally you said things are going to be perfect over time and now youre saying they are perfect now the fact of the matter is automated cars are not monolithic there are many ways of constructing different automated cars and many varying conditions under which they may operate you are basically saying automated cars are magical therefore we wont need insurance how is insurance relevant to a ridiculous article which completely ignores huge glaring facts you ask thanks im glad you asked that well we live in a world where accidents happen an imperfect world at least i domaybe you live in a perfect world so basically the world that most people live in involves insurance so while a year old gizmodo or nextweb or whatever author may wish something to be true its not yet true and may not be true for years or even years because differing technologies take different rates to mature the past does not predict the future and just because weve had one type of computing revolution which happened in one decade does not mean that any other potential technology revolution that we happen to like will necessarily happen at the same pace in another decade sad but true personally im guessing we will see a wide adoption of commercial partial automation of large semi trailers on certain highways in certain times of the years and certain weather conditions via optical sensors in years but i could be wrong it may be more like or and it may require a lot more expensive sensing equipment which granted may take less time to come down in price but we as laypeople dont know that right now therefore insurance law will need to adapt over time and insurance will not become irrelevant in likejune of this year its completely relevant and in fact its codified into the law at least in my state and im willing to bet every state
358,this works only if the communications are reliable and trustworthy however they are not imagine what you could do by screwing with inter car communications on demand traffic jam no problem i think that self driving cars will be forced to rely almost entirely on internal sensors for the foreseeable future which doesnt mean there wont be any improvements to traffic flow simply due to better situational awareness and faster reactions
359,i assume that before that the cost of insurance for manually operated vehicles will be prohibitively expensive long before its actually banned
360,your insurer is never liable as they had nothing to do with causing the accident they reimburse costs based on which driver is liable and currently all automous cars have a driver or operator that is liable for the operation of the vehicle maybe this will change in the future to shift some liability to the manufacturer but we arent there yet
361,your insurer is never liable as they had nothing to do with causing the accident they reimburse costs based on which driver is liable and currently all automous cars have a driver or operator that is liable for the operation of the vehicle maybe this will change in the future to shift some liability to the manufacturer but we arent there yet
362,i like that train of thought but i dont put much stock into that being a thing in my life time multiple owners of one car means there will be times when you cant use it uber style would be more expensive than owning unless you travel very short distances very rarely like leasing a car whether you own a car or partake in a futuristic uber program you essentially pay per mile you drive even when you factor in selling the car eventually changes a little if you dont drive much with uber style the cost per mile is unavoidably higher because you have to pay for someone to clean it the technological infrastructure and wages to make car sharing possible insurancecost splitting in case people vandalize or damage the interior or exterior someone to do simple everyday maintenance like change the wipers and the cost disadvantage of buying a new car if youre someone who usually buys used cars then factor in the fact that the company organizing the scheme and any companies involved with aspects of it would be trying to turn a profit youve got more middlemen between you and the manufacturer if elon musks automation scheme works out and cars end up getting way cheaper in the future the cost disadvantage for uber style ownership might be less of an issue but actual ownership will always be cheaper
363,so will all cars in the future have indefinite warranties at what point is your car your responsibility which is why a lot of places have yearly emission checks so at some point will those test all aspects of the car including self driving
364,right and if its their fault so their insurance will pay and their premium potentially is adjusted
365,the real question is once self driving cars are adopted en masse will we even need insurance companies or would car manufacturers function as their own insurance company a car manufacturer could see the statistical number of accidents their self driving cars cause see the average cost of them and simply say to customers if our car is driving and causes an accident well pay for it then price those payments into the cost of the cars they sell at that point people would only buy insurance to cover their car in the event that you are hit by someone else who has no insurance or if you insist on driving it yourself
366,car manufacturers wont just start paying insurance they have never had to pay before either the easiest and best solution for keeping money in both insurance companies and car manufacturers pockets is for end users to simply continue to pay for it
367,i get what you are saying but businesses are always expected to make bigger and bigger profits thats no different than today i can see prices for insurance of both sdvs and non sdvs will be disproportionate to actual risk so the insurance companies continue to make bigger profits you keep saying stuff but youre not providing any logic or reason for it
368,let me put it this way hypothetically when you get the car with no steering wheel the manufacturer will make you sign a waiver saying that you can buy the car but you accept the risk that it will get in an accident through countless years of experimentation they prove that by using their system you are less likely to get in an accident but if you do get in an accident you will be liable unless of course someone elses car hit you so youre choices are use their system and accept the of getting in an accident that you already agreed to be liable for dont use their system and drive yourself and accept the more risk of getting in an accident youre liable for both choices result in you being liable but option means your much less likely to get in an accident not only that but insurance companies will look at those statistics and greatly reduce your premium if you choose since they are less likely to have to pay you out conversely if you choose option your premiums will be much higher because the odds that they have to pay up are higher hope that helps explain why the driver will always be liable in the case of sdc accidents their system doesnt half to be perfect it just has to be better than people

370,lol nah yeah should have put only one pedestrian however they still are far safer than human drivers and the technology hasnt even been perfected yet lemme ask you though that subset of the population that can only afford to get to work in their dollar beater we kill those people right or do you have some magical thinking ubi bullshit that miracles that problem away too uhhh no itll take a bit for them to become mainstream but once it is we can just have services where you order a self driving car from your phone kind of like an automated uber and if you want to buy a car theyll be the only thing available theyll end up being affordable and actually carry far lower insurance premiums of course most jobs are going to be automated out of existence and well start feeling more and more of the pressure when these come out especially since theyll kill a lot of transport industry jobs ubi or some other program is going to be necessary when most people are out of work
371,your warranty is now void i am not responsible for bricked devices dead sd cards thermonuclear war or you getting fired because the alarm app failed please do some research if you have any concerns about features included in this rom before flashing it you are choosing to make these modifications and if you point the finger at me for messing up your device i will laugh at you someone more clever than me needs to modify this to work for cars
372,yeah should have put only one pedestrian right but there were four fatalities listed there so is there a specific reason you keep deciding to pretend those people are still alive or is this just how you argue uhhh no itll take a bit for them to become mainstream but once it is we can just have services where you order a self driving car from your phone kind of like an automated uber and if you want to buy a car theyll be the only thing available theyll end up being affordable and actually carry far lower insurance premiums oh you mean they get to take robot cabs to work how convenient and affordable for nobody
373,so dont get me wrong self driving cars will be significantly safer than human drivers deaths a year in the us so even if it reduces by half that is deaths per day that is a lot of legal work and reviewing of software to prevent recalls i wouldnt know of any software engineer who would be into working on updates for recalls because the rate of deaths from your self driving company is higher than your competitors the non stop requests to go speak to congress to plead your case in why they dont shut your company down how many is enough of a reduction in deaths to not become an issue is a day below the threshold to continue to not have to fix the issues with the software is okay the good thing about people driving is that the responsibility is fully on the human driver they are worse by the responsibility is distributed across the entire driving population it isnt the responsibility of a couple of companies its these problems that mean self driving cars wont be legal in our lifetimes
374,crazy how many people are missing my point my point isnt that autopilot is garbage my point is that when it crashes its not the drivers fault lol and you arent getting the point of others your driving sucks compared to any autonomous driving vehicle on the road today and its backed up by evidence as is your refusal to accept it thats all no muddying the waters about anything else such as insurance rates who pays for crashes your skill vs the entire country or any of that or anything else you can come up with
375,no one it was an tragic accident youre insurance company will cover most of the damages you accepted the risk when you bought the car
376,so i provide no logic but then you agree of my points is logical hmmmm odd logic you have there im saying insurance companies are pricing their policies today appropriately and as a disruptive technology becomes more adopted they arent going to lower prices to a level proportionate to the associated risk
377,they are young most likely male with a low understanding of how insurance works probably white based on a quick skimming of his profile hes probably a republican id say not so far from the average as hed hoped shrug
378,so i provide no logic but then you agree of my points is logical hmmmm odd logic you have there because one doesnt lead to the other at all im saying insurance companies are pricing their policies today appropriately and as a disruptive technology becomes more adopted they arent going to lower prices to a level proportionate to the associated risk for starters i didnt say anything about prices going down necessarily my argument was against people saying insurance companies would raise prices but if the cost to provide that service does in fact go down and you dont reduce prices youre opening yourself up to other competitors beating you on price you know the same exact thing that keeps companies from raising prices indiscriminately today
379,think you can do that in most states also moving violations frequently mean getting points on your license having to pay ridiculous processing fees on top of the fine new york and insurance rates likely going up even if it means taking some time off work itd cost more in the long run not to fight the ticket only a waste of time if you know youre guilty
380,self driving cars are a ways away i highly doubt that trucking will go away soon companies are unlikely to want the liability of the mess we currently have the absolute best self driving cars we have still have problems like hitting stationary road markers and running clearly visible stop signs and red lights these are also cars that have people who can handle expensive maintenance the guy who drives trucks is the guy who can make decisions regarding how to handle low visibility situations stop to clear off the windshield take directions from the person directing traffic notice when the truck needs maintenence make the payments for maintaining the truck with either your money or your employers money handle situations where the internet is not available recognize when the route you were planning to take is unacceptable cars have a long way to go before they can do those things
381,technologically pretty close i think it was years ago they did a test wish with a self driving big rig on the highway human driver was watching from his sleeper cabin iirc that one didnt test controlling an wheeler in city streets just highways more recently theyve done more tests and of course uber was testing autonomous taxis in arizona years ago so from a technology standpoint i wouldnt be surprised if any day now there was an announcement of an entirely driverless cartruck legislatively thats where its going to get complicated theres a lot of legal issues to sort out liability whose at fault etc and so on and what there isnt is will to solve those problems but once the will is there i expect theyll be solved relatively quickly and youll start seeing fully autonomous commercial vehicles that said when that happens its not going to be an overnight thing there will be a slow conversion of the truck fleets and probably a few hiccups when theres some big high profile crash involving an autonomous truck and a rolls dice busful of special needs elementary students so when it finally starts there will be time probably at least a decade if not decades to dive a new career
382,how far along are self driving cars they are safer cheaper in the long run assuming enough are made to make up for development costs and more reliable than human drivers should i be worried for my future as a truck driver no politicians dont care as much about something being safer than human drivers as they do about allowing this would make truck drivers vote for the other guy after all people that die in traffic accidents can no longer vote or but even if ten times fewer traffic accidents happen ill get blamed for those ones
383,its not a to conversion though you dont need a ton of coders each truck does not need its own mechanic or coder one or a couple mechanics is normally responsible for an entire fleet of trucks at a company and those jobs already exist theyll just get trained in new models so this is not even a created job as for coders welleach truck is gonna have the exact same software onboard give or take a few options from factory youll only need a few dozen to a few hundred coders for the entire lineup of a whole manufacturers vehicles this is in contrast to the hundreds of thousands possibly millionsof trucker positions that would get eliminated youll lose potentially millions of trucker positions but only gain maybe a few thousand or couple tens of thousands coder positions its still going to be a huge net loss in jobs
384,ask the insurance companies this question there needs to be a clear answer to who is liable in a crash before your insurance company will sign off on the policy human in the vehicle means said human would be liable how would you like paying for a crash caused by fords ai software lovely right no human meanswho is liable does nationwide go after ford or tesla or whoever then dont think auto manufacturers would let that one flythey are eager to make the software but dont want any liability once it leaves the factory until that question gets answered likely via some sort of new law your insurance company would not even sign off on a policy with a car that has no human in it and since no one is eager to volunteer to be liable for damages caused soley by ai this human free vehicle aint gonna happen anytime soon

387,to you are damn optimistic id say at a minimum people are very skeptical about ai driving cars and there is a huge question of liability that has not been answered at all if a fully self driving car gets into a accident even machines arent perfect who is at fault the driver its fully self driving and advertised as such the driver had zero input people are not going to like being responsible for the fuck ups of a self driving machine that then leaves the manufacturer would the auto maker be responsible since it was their ai that caused the accident you can bet your ass manufacturers wont let that one fly so you see the real legal issue here thathonestlyeveryone has thus far been kicking down the road it needs solved before fully autonomous cars become commonplace and legal and before insurance companies will sign off on it

390,im lucky to be really fanatical about dieting and lifestyle i fasted for hours a day last week as part of an intermittant fasting diet i plan to supplement it with vitamins to meet my daily needs in the future and work life balance is important but there comes a point where being poor having no money having no insurance or stability starts to harm you more than slaving away but being safe would but i understand perfectionism and being a workaholic is something i have struggled with in the past and im well aware of it
391,xb mid thirties single with k usd in cash no house no debt my physician career too stressful do i just push on for more yrs do i start over and retrain as software engineer my childhood dream no you do not push on for years hopefully if you are a decent physician you understand the negative effects of mental stress and daily unhappiness many people have changed careers much later in life than mid s xb could i smartly invest large chunk in cryptostock to make money and do low paid job crypto seems like an unreasonable risk to me there are much safer reliable and predictable investment options you can discuss this in rpersonalfinance
392,hardware failure is an expected risk its natural people would be weary of new technology and its reliability
393,it has to do with responsibility if a part in a car is defective the manufacturer is probably liable if i make a bad decision while driving im probably liable but who is responsible for a choice the ai makes imagine an autonomous car is about to crash into an obstacle if it swerves it will avoid the obstacle but risks striking a pedestrian what does it do and who is to blame for the error if a car does exactly what it is programmed to do can we say it was defective we just dont have laws or legal precedent to answer these questions

396,its more fear mongering probably by people who are scared of technologydont like change facts are a machine us far more reliable than a human especially since the machine isnt going to go out drunk driving
397,there are lots of jobs like this at my dentists office the hygienists are all long time pros the only thing they need the certified dentist for at this point is to render a second opinion and to be their liability lightning rod its important to know what youre being paid for and charge accordingly
398,same question as being a pa vs an md you dont have to go through nearly as many years of school or accumulate as much debt and you do only specific things you are specifically trained on under the supervision of someone who takes on that responsibility and liability should something go wrong it also reduces cost and barrier to entry for labor in that specific field imagine how much dental services would need to cost if everyone working back there has a doctorate degree worth of debt to pay off it doesnt take someone with the skills and knowledge to perform more advanced oral procedures to do a simple cleaning just like how for the average person it often isnt worth making an appointment with your doctor for the sole purpose of getting vaccinated and your local pharmacy or convenience clinic can get it done with a walk in at a much lower cost done by a nurse or pharmacist

400,im perfectly aware i used to work at an sdc company but when theres a safety driver theyre there for well safety not for liability if a company was at the point where all they cared about was liability they would pay for an insurance policy which would be much cheaper than hiring a driver the whole point of deploying self driving cars commercially is to save money

402,with the same confidence and reliability as this more than years
403,thats an interesting use case i can imagine that some type of long term rental where you keep the car for multiple days could fulfill those needs car rental is really cheap nowadays rental companies only make money through insurance a one week road trip might only cost you
404,you misunderstand first let me clarify my statement i am saying that it would take tesla more than years to create something as confidentreliable as this video with their current hardware and i know they plan on continuing with this hardware as that is their strategy and they have been promising fsd with this current hardware take a company that is pretty good at innovating i agree tesla is great at innovating and an extremely exciting company however for them to create what you see in this video with their hardware and strategy will several times harder than what waymo has done it will require vastly more technology breakthroughs that are not in the foreseeable future if tesla were to drop their current strategy and hardware and start over and create a waymo clone i am sure they could do that in years or so but they do not intent to do that when you have pretty much half a million cars or more collecting driving data worldwide on edge cases sigh you and everyone else have got to drop this man its a useful tool but is really far less relevant and important than you believe waymo has at last publishing in a fleet of vehicles even if they quadrupled that its still less than vehicles out in the wild collecting data irrelevant i dont think its a hardware issue at this time its more getting the software right yes but when you have less hardware redundancies the software doesnt need to be a little better it needs to be x x times better k people that already bought it its going to be a massive change only k its gotta be higher than this tesla is selling k vehicles per quarter years is probably my best case idea for teslas software to be at this level we are seeing i share your excitement and enthusiasm its fun to dream i agree wouldnt that be something if that turned about to be the case but i hope you arent getting in to deep into the fantasy
405,maybe i should clarify that by confidence i mean reliability probability that an accident will happen without safety driver every mile or million miles as you can see clearly in all these tesla videos they cannot go millions of miles without touching the wheel disengaging autopilot this is what is necessary for actual self driving
406,i am also sitting on tesla shares and i think tesla will be very successful i think tesla will release really exciting features that require human supervision over the next months and years and that will be a big part of their success but no you have to believe me that tesla is not going to reach waymo like self driving reliability in this decade sorry
407,i think you are underestimating the costs of cars since i think weve spread it around so much so to have a car you must pay for insurance and taxes which is going to cost you around you still havent moved the car or paid for it for reference it costs for unlimited bus rides in my decent sized city or in nyc unlimited metro is then you have to pay for the car which can be very expensive and put gas in it and make repairs to it aaa puts the cost of a new car at http newsroomaaacomtagcost to own a vehicle also think of all the space needed to operate a car for it to be effective its estimated that there are parking spots per car thats enough land space to have a house on that you arent paying for directly but what about the added cost to you for groceries because they provided parking for free a fast food lot is not for people but for cars how about all this land dedicated to the car for mechanics gas stations parking lots and roads to have parking on you are paying for all of these indirectly of our land in cities is for cars also a driver we are literally talking about driverless cars in a video showing these capabilities
408,just give us driverless cars already ive been waiting for this for years taxisubers are expensive unreliable and unsafe i dont want people getting intoxicated and driving but that level is different for different people
409,i feel like this is going to be developed by actuaries at insurance companies not by engineers mobileye specializes in designing the tech not in paying for the damages
410,now heres the big question if the vehicle is under control of the ai and gets in an accident whos liable for the accident the owner or the company who created the ai who pays for the accident as far as im concerned it should not be the driver
411,who is responsible if they crash and someone dies i dont really understand how this point can ever be mitigated
412,radar cruise and lane keeping assist the car steers you into the lane have been a thing in the uk for years really dont understand the headline for the article if you read the article however it clarifies that when these systems are on they intend for the car company to be responsible for any accidents instead of the driver which is much bigger news seems no one in this thread has read the article though
413,i think it will be something like a big long text stating that the driver is held responsible for any accidents youll then scroll through all the way to the bottom without giving it a proper read and click on agree to the terms and conditions
414,its has been used for years you can youtube plenty of teslas driving around the states themselves currently the law states for insurance purposes that a human must be ready to take control this isnt a new thing this has been around forever its just recently we have access to massive amounts of data to enable this kind of ai the year was no different waymo drove million miles in the state which is not even its primary testing ground its cars disengaged times for a rate of disengagements per miles thats down from in source latest self driving car statistics from california
415,self driving cars wont be the norm for a long long time think about the thousands of cars you see every day wherever you live they arent going anywhere anytime soon especially as cars are nicer safer and more reliable than theyve ever been even a car from doesnt seem as old today as a car from did then a car likely wont feel that old in barring some massive unseen tech advance on the level of the smartphone the poor people who cant afford anything but a year old beater what would they do what about all the year old classics people still own and drive today human driven cars will be around for at least the next few decades if not the rest of the century
416,i think something we often miss in these conversations is liability if you remove the wheel you move the responsibility from the driver and place it on the manufacturer there is no way auto manufacturers are going to take responsibility for every accident unless there is legislation absolving them from that responsibility all cars will continue to have wheels and pedals and the user will be expected to remain ready to take over at any time
417,i think something we often miss in these conversations is liability if you remove the wheel you move the responsibility from the driver and place it on the manufacturer there is no way auto manufacturers are going to take responsibility for every accident unless there is legislation absolving them from that responsibility all cars will continue to have wheels and pedals and the user will be expected to remain ready to take over at any time
418,this is going to disrupt the insurance industry in the next years
419,nah insurance cost is just like any other cost it will be baked into the price of the vehicles the auto companies will have great clout to drive insurance costs down and they wont have people in the loop to make their programming look bad there will still be steering wheels in some cars to give ppl the feeling that they are actually driving but a nanny will be there to take over when you fuck up
420,i mean we could still have a requirement of insurance for people who own their own self driving cars it would be much easier to provide responsibility with a self driving car too as they have tens of cameras radars ladars etc whos data could be reviewed to find out what went wrong if its a self driving car owned by a fleet company like uber or local taxi company etc then that company would be responsible for insuring their vehicles just like they are currently

423,insurance companies hate this one weird trick
424,car companies need insurance too
425,when the idiot mob finally realizes that computers are x better and safer at driving than humans are insurance for human drivers will go through the roof
426,i suspect as autonomous cars take over insurance rates on these cars will remain largely the same but the rates for non autonomous cars will skyrocket
427,warren buffet agrees buffett geico self driving cars insurance liability
428,warren buffet agrees buffett geico self driving cars insurance liability
429,interesting take that would make sense i suppose as the cars get better than humans wrapping in a lifetime insurance cost would not be so exorbitant
430,right now a lot of money in insurance is made by charging some people a lot more than others under male been in a wreck even if it wasnt your fault when the car and not the occupant is insured they wont be able to do that every gm autobot will be insured the same because they all drive the same
431,every gm autobot will be insured the same because they all drive the same that will be true when every car on the road is self piloting but not before youre still going to see insurance rates fluctuate based on region and population areas with more accidents will see higher rates regardless of if the cars drive themselves or not
432,home insurance isnt as common here since fires arent as big of a thing with the way we build houses and coverage of contents from home invasion or flood damage is laughable they make bank on auto and motorcycle insurance and medical
433,thats precisely what i meant the technology is there but adoption is years away at least widespread where its more common to have a self driving car for the average consumer than a manually driven car theres numerous factors that limit this beyond just people wanting to trust themselves cost in an era with wage stagnation and rising costs of living there are entire demographics that have no car or can only afford to buy year old beaters every couple years these people wont be able to likely own one of these self drivers for a generation or two the middle ish class that can afford new cars within the current generation will likely hold off on adoption until its proven technology as many of these people have families that will not trust in the hands of a computer yet this leaves consumer adoption with the wealthy elite that have both need and money or the technically affluent that stays with the latest developments regulation this is probably going to be a slow nut to crack until its been proven and insurance companies get fully behind it easier than pricing but harder than the development of the tech used car market this is basically where the majority of america buys through and as i stated most car models see years in circulation overall it will take at least this long for self drivers to be widely available to consumers i expect the business market like trucking and cabs to be pushed for first and then another for non self drivers to cycle out of the market to where having a manual car is as rare as owning a car with manual transmission is today then another years where a non self driver is a classic collector type thing my year statement was that it would take that long for self drivers to be widespread ie the primary car type
434,another problem is insurance and responsibility
435,another problem is insurance and responsibility
436,dont bother reading you will be dumber for doing so this has to be one of the most ignorant articles i have ever read it is full of biased and contextually wrong information plus it just makes no sense a full self driving vehicle completely removes a driver for the simple fact of being a better more reliable driver in theory so people losing driving skills has no bearing on the quality of self driving plus it mentions the boeing max which was a completely idiotic and deadly failure on boeings part of how they programmed a critical component with no backup sensor to drive the plane nose down into the ground nothing whatsoever to do with the pilots lack of capability
437,just like cars led to people not knowing how to saddle and bridle a horse technology moves forward we leave the antiquated behind people are bad at driving if and when reliable and safe alternatives arise why would we need to know how to do something from the past no one laments not knowing how to yoke cattle to plow fields
438,also insurance is tesla responsible for my crash or me
439,also insurance is tesla responsible for my crash or me
440,this is the main differentiator of level and above at that point the car is in control and the car is responsible tesla fsd is probably close to level but for legal purposes it will still be considered level thats why i dont get arguments when people say tesla is only level just like xxx where xxx is a basic adaptive cruise control in most cars adaptive cruise control is not the same as tesla fsd even though they are both level
441,people baffle me with the what about computer error argument as if human error isnt already the cause for almost every car accident once we get this self driving stuff figured out insurance companies will see a severe drop in claims
442,im really hoping that self driving and related tech will have a significant positive effect on road safety for responsible cyclists
443,we also need to know if theyre in any way pulling people out of mass transit and into cars since that is the among the worst possible results of such a service while were at it we need to know how many drivers are using the service and how much demand on parking area is reduced also we need to know if a permanent reliable transit line could be offered to replace these rides
444,tesla really is just a double edged sword youre getting an electric car that has all of the tech and features you could possibly want in a car you have great software cool design language and decentgreat battery range on the other hand the support and maintenance is a fucking nightmare replacement parts are either expensive as shit or nonexistent software is mostly good but some critical components like self driving arent polished the engineering on some components are way too over engineered for what theyre doing leading to horrible reliability
445,using owners as your test platform is sloppy at best they can validate your testing when done in a controlled environment when they are informed that they are participating in a test rolling out an automatic update and triaging the results is incredibly irresponsible when the context is a machine that can kill someone when it operates knowing how they test doesnt make it any less sloppy
446,in the fsd beta program you are in full control of the vehicle and you are to expect interventions often as the program improves this is made extremely clear before youre allowed into the program you are responsible for not taking over if your car does something stupid which it will the car will often do the wrong thing at the worst possible time is how its written in the agreement
447,would you rather be on the road with a properly licensed regulated responsible driver who is not just half assed tested once in his entire life back in the teen years and in a society where we dont pressure people into driving when tired and give people ample cheap public transportation and remove unfair stigmas against it so they can use alternate transportation when needed or let technology we dont even trust to run our dumb little phones correctly do something as important and mission critical as drive a car something that not only can potentially endanger the passenger but people in other cars and property around them regulation and change has to happen technology isnt the solution to everything since technology isnt perfect and can potentially be far more dangerous than a distracted driver our over reliance on technology has gotten us into a world full of anti privacy and anti freedom as well as so many other things that has dehumanized us to a point where we are essentially a slave to it technology has to be a tool not a means to an end we cannot allow automated driving to exist as it would cause so many more issues than it would solve as well as further erode privacy and freedom yes humans driving are problematic but solving that issue by doing common sense things to help our society eliminate a large number of these problems is a far better solution than further enslaving ourselves to repressive big brother technology im a lifelong sysadmin and programmer ask anyone like me and theyll say the same dont let technology run our lives its not anti technology its anti control and technology isnt reliable or secure enough in any situation to allow it bugs and hacks will happen and theres no way to safeguard it
448,would you rather be on the road with a properly licensed regulated responsible driver who is not just half assed tested once in his entire life back in the teen years and in a society where we dont pressure people into driving when tired and give people ample cheap public transportation and remove unfair stigmas against it so they can use alternate transportation when needed or let technology we dont even trust to run our dumb little phones correctly do something as important and mission critical as drive a car something that not only can potentially endanger the passenger but people in other cars and property around them regulation and change has to happen technology isnt the solution to everything since technology isnt perfect and can potentially be far more dangerous than a distracted driver our over reliance on technology has gotten us into a world full of anti privacy and anti freedom as well as so many other things that has dehumanized us to a point where we are essentially a slave to it technology has to be a tool not a means to an end we cannot allow automated driving to exist as it would cause so many more issues than it would solve as well as further erode privacy and freedom yes humans driving are problematic but solving that issue by doing common sense things to help our society eliminate a large number of these problems is a far better solution than further enslaving ourselves to repressive big brother technology im a lifelong sysadmin and programmer ask anyone like me and theyll say the same dont let technology run our lives its not anti technology its anti control and technology isnt reliable or secure enough in any situation to allow it bugs and hacks will happen and theres no way to safeguard it
449,i dont have to imagine the scenario because i see it all the time its extremely unsettling when the oncoming driver occupant responsible for safe operation of the vehicle isnt paying one bit of attention makes me want to hang up the helmet and participate in the arms race of trucks where bigger better just to survive my commute
450,exactly literally every other car company well lets put rivian and the other tech focused startups aside actually has to make their cars safe at risk of being sued into oblivion so why and how tesla is allowed to conduct glorified alpha testing on public roads is astounding to me i really hope they get reigned in and soon because what theyre doing right now is beyond irresponsible its likely going to cost lives before we know it
451,this beta gets rolled out to users who are selected for being specifically responsible while operating the car in auto pilot mode that must opt in and sign a waiver acknowledging that its beta software and they need to be extra careful while assisting with the test i still agree it should be regulated but this isnt like they roll it out to every single car at the same time
452,just wanna also mention pharmaceutical companies and health insurance companies everyone seems to forget they are silent yet more powerful than almost all other companies
453,i am under no impression that fsd is perfect or even good but the bar is pretty low for exceeding human capability lets do some quick math the fatality rate for human drivers is deaths per million miles traveled statisticsdetailstate by state tesla has about million cars with autopilot on the road cleantechnicacomover tesla vehicles with autopilot on the road the average driver drives miles per week cut our driving in half is it time for pay per mile insurance shbadaad so telsa drivers alone are collectively averaging million miles per week this means that even if the tesla autopilot got into a fatal accident once a week every single week that fatality rate would be more than twice as safe as human drivers i think you severely overestimate what it takes to be better than the average driver and just perceive a higher risk because its a loss of control not cause its actually riskier
454,if we are talking about safety chritical a human can take over at any time thats not considered a reliable fail safe for a couple of reasons humans cant react as quickly as computers can so if a computer makes a wrong decision it will take a human longer to make a right decision and at mph that can be deadly additionally theres a wealth of research showing that people monitoring automated systems just stop paying attention after a while so the odds that the driver will catch an error in time drop dramatically as trip length increases
455,as opposed to what the actuarial tables the rest of our lives are based on im any other business the bankinsurancecompany can assume youre not financially soundunhealthyunfit for anything based on just knowing your age and gender do you really think actual digital driving records of your personal acceleration awareness and accidents is bullshit compared to what actual other data that is used in real life
456,every other manufacturer tests their vehicles in a wide range of situations with their own staff behind the wheel and their own liability no reason tesla shouldnt do the same in validating their software
457,yes if a human driver hits another human driver i suggest we ban them from driving as their algorithm is broken and should not be aloud to guide cars we dont do that though we look at the situation and we dont generally punish people for accidents if the driver was negligent theres jail time but if someone happened to dive in the drivers path at the last minute the driver is not at fault have to look at the issue beside we do regulate human drivers its called a drivers license yes and this applies here use of teslas autopilot in the road currently requires a licensed driver thats the regulatory rule take something like adaptive cruise control a common feature in many of the current cars if theres a problem with it and the car doesnt slow down as a result of the car in front of you the driver is expected to brake himself you wouldnt expect the feature of adaptive cruise control to be banned if theres a problem with it in a ford model youd expect ford to recall it and fix it if theres an accident as a result of it unless the bug was one that prevented the human from overriding the adaptive cruise control youd expect the driver to be punished the more advanced features of the tesla should fall in the same category as long as the regulation is that a licensed driver is required on the wheel the licensed driver has responsibility if autopilot kills someone and the driver didnt disengage the autopilot that driver should be punished and tesla is expected to recall the feature and fix it unless the bug is such that it prevented the driver from disengaging autopilot in which case tesla should be criminally responsible for negligence
458,yes if a human driver hits another human driver i suggest we ban them from driving as their algorithm is broken and should not be aloud to guide cars we dont do that though we look at the situation and we dont generally punish people for accidents if the driver was negligent theres jail time but if someone happened to dive in the drivers path at the last minute the driver is not at fault have to look at the issue beside we do regulate human drivers its called a drivers license yes and this applies here use of teslas autopilot in the road currently requires a licensed driver thats the regulatory rule take something like adaptive cruise control a common feature in many of the current cars if theres a problem with it and the car doesnt slow down as a result of the car in front of you the driver is expected to brake himself you wouldnt expect the feature of adaptive cruise control to be banned if theres a problem with it in a ford model youd expect ford to recall it and fix it if theres an accident as a result of it unless the bug was one that prevented the human from overriding the adaptive cruise control youd expect the driver to be punished the more advanced features of the tesla should fall in the same category as long as the regulation is that a licensed driver is required on the wheel the licensed driver has responsibility if autopilot kills someone and the driver didnt disengage the autopilot that driver should be punished and tesla is expected to recall the feature and fix it unless the bug is such that it prevented the driver from disengaging autopilot in which case tesla should be criminally responsible for negligence
459,the only truly important regulation would be car makers are liable for all accidents caused by the self driving car that alone should guarantee that they will spend billions of dollars in research ensuring that the car is both safe for autonomous driving as well as secure against remote hacks any other fixed regulation will just get them to comply with the minimum legal requirements and there isnt any guarantee that those regulations are perfect or even optimal for self driving car safety in fact the government has even hinted that it doesnt want to impose too many regulations on the car makers because its still an infant domain it makes sense but as i said if they were reliable that would be all the incentive they needed to ensure maximum safety and security
460,they make sense right now but they wont ever go away insurance companies will not make nearly as much if the auto company is paying the bill instead of the consumer
461,with potentially hundreds of dollars per month in savings ive owned my civic outright for about years now i pay month in insurance and month in gas long commute to work hundreds of dollars a month in savings is a stretch and i seriously doubt id be able to get a commuter subscription from uber for less than month and i would lose out on the convenience of having my own car just waiting in my driveway for when i realize i need something at the store or have an emergency with a pet or something most of the time those cars sit idle in your garage or a parking lot thats a good thing easier on the environment when you return home your car just sits empty but inert but an on demand car has to spend lots of extra time empty but driving to its next pickup or back to the station
462,idk shifting liability like that could cause less companies to get on board
463,i feel companies just wouldnt be down to accept responsibility things still break no matter how well designed they are and we still see a bunch of recalls in this day and age add the complexity of the software also bugging too and things can still go wrong and that is a lot of liability for the company to have
464,i feel companies just wouldnt be down to accept responsibility things still break no matter how well designed they are and we still see a bunch of recalls in this day and age add the complexity of the software also bugging too and things can still go wrong and that is a lot of liability for the company to have
465,i think theres actually going to be a huge problem with self driving cars in the works of the time state its really easy to tell a human that they have to pay attention and be responsible for the vehicle at all times but have you met humans they are terrible as stand by operators if they arent actively controlling the vehicle they will not be ready to take over at a moments notice they will not be watching the road and remaining vigilant at all times
466,i have to think insurance companies cant wait for self driving cars people will likely still need to have auto insurance but the number of times they need to pay out will very likely drop exponentially
467,id also bet that a majority of car owners dont accurately know their total cost of ownership because you have to add payment fuel maintenance insurance depreciation etc and not understanding the real cost of your choices is a recipe for bad financial decisions
468,by the time the government actually starts to regulate out people driving themselves of people would have switched due to the inherent advantages or at least the cheaper insurance
469,jesus christ my insurance is literally ten times more expensive than yours ouch
470,i mean if the car drives itself who else would be liable but the manufacturer that taught it to drive
471,in the short term it will be very profitable for the insurance companies but all it will take is one major company adjusting their pricing to match the risk to move the whole market downward actually i wouldnt be surprised if the early self driving car manufacturers apple tesla google started their own insurance company or form partnerships with bigger ones
472,right as long as they can continue to tap the consumer directly thats my point even if it makes no sense at all for the individual to carry insurance because the no longer have any control over the vehicle the insurance companies will lobby to keep these laws in place if they can maintain the illusion of personal responsibility they can keep charging individuals who have little bargaining power on prices compared to google ford uber etc instead of the companies who produce the self driving cars and actually have more control over their performance on the road

474,many commercial trucks in the us are owner operated theyll buy the tech for themselves also the reduction in accidents will result in lower insurance premiums and fewer lawsuits fromagainst their drivers from there it will just be a math problem as to whether autopilot tech is purchased or not
475,so society has no responsibility to help transition those who are displaced
476,you pay a month for insurance
477,dont be a young shitty driver thats really the only reason to have high insurance premiums because you are a risk you may not be either just saying thats usually why insurance is high for most people edit negative comment karma for giving factual information good job reddit
478,the person behind the wheel currently you are still responsible for being able to take control at any moment
479,in some oncoming decades manual drivers might be a little miffed about their insurance premiums going to high z because theyre literally making other cars on the streets less safe by manual driving just like how people dont ride horses down busy streets youre going to be looking at manual driving being relegated to tracks
480,and people dont die because were more reliable than machines s
481,i think even the race to the bottom will probably still be profitable depending on how rarely they actually will need to pay anything out i think this will probably be a deciding factor that will push people out of manual cars when their insurance rates start to sky rocket
482,my prediction is that we will move towards cars as a service you lease a car from alphabetteslawhatever that chinese one is for years so they have all rights to the programming and you cant modify the vehicle they will also want control over how often its maintained and so they can demand the sensors be repaired with this lease some will just throw in the insurance because itll be cheap and marketingaccounting will say its a good deal for us
483,why as a human youre much more dangerous other people are at risk even to the extent that compulsary rd party insurance removes the risk of you costing other parties money theres still the risk you could maim or kill them should people still have the option to drive extremely old unsafe cars in many juristictions classic car enthusiasts arent allowed to take their old cars on the roads also synergy between autonomous vehicles means the road networks will work better without human drivers even a small number of human drivers will cause problems
484,oh no thats pretty fair i backed into a parked vehicle and i got pulled over for speeding without my address on my license updated or my renewed insurance in the vehicle and i havent been driving that long but even before that it was still almost
485,sounds about right then also there is a huge difference if you have full coverage vs just liability if you have a newer car chances are you are forced to have full coverage whereas my classic car only costs about sounds like you have full coverage
486,that only happens in markets where there is either a lot of competition or easy barrier to entry unfortunately it seems like the majority of markets today have neither that being said if major car companies opted for their own insurance that would create more competition which has a possibility of dropping rates
487,there is quite a bit of competition in car insurance markets today and if the driver less car companies banded together they easily have enough capital on hand to start their own insurance company if they desired to
488,sorry i was talking more generally yes there is a lot of competition with car insurance that ideology doesnt work in every market though which was the point i was trying to make p
489,good point many people dont have the vaguest idea how reliable specifically designed hardware and embedded software are they think its going to be as reliable as their home pc when its much closer to being as reliable as a hand held calculator i doubt any of us even know someone who had a hand held calculator ever return the wrong value
490,people arent really the problem honestly if you give people the ability to have a self driving uber show up at their door and drive them wherever they need to go whenever they need to go for a fraction of the cost of automotive ownership people will use it in droves the problem is all the industries people having that level of convenience and safety disrupts those industries auto manufacturing petrochemical insurance rely on every commuter needing or wanting their own personal vehicle they dont make enough money otherwise and if that means they keep driving over a million dead bodies most of whom are children a year to do it thats exactly what theyre going to keep doing and why they bribe governments to kill self driving technology
491,the argument tends to boil down to x amount of people die from y so we should ban y while im sure there wouldnt be an explicit law banning older not self driving cars i worry that it would be prohibitively expensive through either insurance or fuel cost
492,insurance companies wont like that how can you be legally pressed to pay them their monthly extortion installments if you arent legally responsible for an accident caused by the vehicle
493,insurance companies wont like that how can you be legally pressed to pay them their monthly extortion installments if you arent legally responsible for an accident caused by the vehicle
494,if the car manufactors make an ai to drive then we can hold the cars individually responsible that will teach them
495,my cousin is a legal expert in autonomous vehicles and apparently the reality is somewhere in between it relies on what level of autonomy the vehicle has level full autonomy but requires user supervision in the case of error the user is legally responsible ie liable in a claim level full autonomy with not requirement for user supervision manufacturer is responsible
496,my cousin is a legal expert in autonomous vehicles and apparently the reality is somewhere in between it relies on what level of autonomy the vehicle has level full autonomy but requires user supervision in the case of error the user is legally responsible ie liable in a claim level full autonomy with not requirement for user supervision manufacturer is responsible
497,so we would need to buy the car from the manufacturer and the insurance too
498,the issue with self driving cars is that they can only see so much in some cases they cant tell what a shadow is if theres a lorry turned over if a car is parked on the side of the road just to name a few end of the day until all cars are self driving i believe that it should always be the drivers responsibility as theres sometimes a need for the driver to take over
499,obligatory rfuckcars ice cars are on their way out it is antiquated technology instead of addressing the significant problems caused by mass car adoption health public space injury to others microplastic pollution carbon emissions noise pollution etc there is a lot of pressure to just transition to self drive electric cars understand this is mostly to keep in the pockets of automotive companies insurance companies etc i like cars and outside of the city are often necessary because of the lack of public transport options but i recognise that companies like tesla and such keep trying to reinvent the bustramstrains but worse
500,liability is a problem sure self driving reduces accidents by something like but thats still a lot of death every day for a company to take on by itself its already very unlikely that your fatal car accident makes it to local news beyond the traffic report they happen so frequently
501,its not just ethically who is in control but given that everybody with a self driving car will need to buy insurance then its one of the most cost effective ways for owners of self driving cars to take out insurance who is going to get the better deal a billion pound car manufacturer or you on your phone to somebody who is reading a script they likely have zero legal training to understand and even if they did theyre employed to rip you off in the ideal world the government would be in charge of taking our insurance policies for us all because we have a democratic say in what that decision they make but the second best option is for the car manufacturers
502,here in the usa we had a case where one of the people in one of these self driving cars was basically thrown under the bus by the car company saying it was their fault it was really sad the person who was the test driver was a trans woman and had multiple felonies for various non violent things obviously this person struggled a lot in their life and got this job of being a test driver because there really didnt need to be any qualifications all they did was sit in the drivers seat and they were to intervene and take manual control of the car if something went wrong xb well this poor person was arrested thrown in jail and slandered after some crackhead basically ran themself into the car effectively killing themself the car company forget the name i think it was waymo blamed it all on this poor person saying they should have been paying attention and steered away they had video from inside the car of course and the tester was just sitting there playing on their phone when suddenly out of the blue comes some person on a bike straight into the car this happened so fast it was pretty much two seconds from when the camera sees the person on the bike to the impact this also happened at night so it is unlikely the test driver even if they werent staring at their phone would have seen much less been able to anticipate thebike riders actions not to mention the car had the headlights on and could clearly be seen yet the bike rider still drove immediately in front of them which to me seemed to indicate they probably werent perceptually aware enough to understand the vehicle was closer than they were thinking it was xb long story short the test driver was sent to jail for manslaughter and nothing happened to the company they took no responsibility
503,for all autonomous cars are fantastic i dont see it happening any time soon and mostly for the reasons around morality the question is not if the question is when does the car protect the driver in all instances or a pedestrian does the car preference an older person over a younger one does the car preference a pregnant woman or a couple there will be situations where death of someone is nearly assured and what the car decides will be out of the hands of anyone involved in the crash and likely the systems and its inbuilt morality will be based on the morals of a different country likely the us or japan regulation is also an absolute nightmare and i find it really surprising that we are so convinced by self driving cars when self driving trains are still not the norm whos liable is just a fraction of these huge issues
504,it might be obvious if the cars were always self driving the problem is that at the moment they are only partly so and that will probably continue for a long time this means that the car will hand control over to the user at times and may do so at short notice when the user is not paying attention if a crash results is that going to be legally the fault of the user or of the company which designed the car which handed over control while the user was pouring coffee if the company goes out of business must any cars of that brand be taken off the road despite a good safety record i can see the arguments for holding the company entirely responsible and i used to take this line now i think that it cant be simplified that much
505,isnt the owner responsible for maintenance
506,easily the manufacturer will insure the car and you will pay monthly subscription fees to use it it stops becoming owned and you will use the car as a service as we do it more and more with software insurance companies can stop caring about everyday users and only do business with companies which is way easier and more lucrative anyway
507,this should all but kill the car insurance industry except maybe damage theft if possible and battery insurance
508,fire theft damage and legal protection insurance companies would still make sure they got the same profits but it would be a bigger percentage of the total payment
509,these cars are likely to be effectively robot driven cabs you dont pay for insurance when you hire a cab get on a bus or a train and you arent responsible if the driver has an accident that you didnt cause as others have said the future is going to be cars as a service rather than buying them i want to go to the shops open an app the car shows up and takes you where you want to go and leaves that helps solve the problem of people not having driveways or places to charge their cars too
510,these cars are likely to be effectively robot driven cabs you dont pay for insurance when you hire a cab get on a bus or a train and you arent responsible if the driver has an accident that you didnt cause as others have said the future is going to be cars as a service rather than buying them i want to go to the shops open an app the car shows up and takes you where you want to go and leaves that helps solve the problem of people not having driveways or places to charge their cars too
511,you dont think car insurance should be a legal requirement
512,i would say if i buy a car and let it loose on the road and it smashes through a shop window it would be my responsibility since i was the one who directed it i would need insurance to cover the cost the insurance company could then try to recover their cost from either myself or the manufacturer also if i do not keep it maintained eg bald tyres which causes an accident when the vehicle can not break in time then i would be responsible for the accident
513,i would say if i buy a car and let it loose on the road and it smashes through a shop window it would be my responsibility since i was the one who directed it i would need insurance to cover the cost the insurance company could then try to recover their cost from either myself or the manufacturer also if i do not keep it maintained eg bald tyres which causes an accident when the vehicle can not break in time then i would be responsible for the accident

515,i am guessing manufacturers will always make cars that dont quite fit what ever definition of fully automated they come up with that way there will be more wriggle room in terms of their liability but maybe not
516,is that going to be legally the fault of the user or of the company which designed the car which handed over control while the user was pouring coffee this isnt what current semi autonomous vehicles are meant for as much as i think the tech is dangerous i cant really blame the manufacturer when people fail to follow what is legally required of them if the company goes out of business must any cars of that brand be taken off the road despite a good safety record i can see manufacturers being required to have insurance covering this or for all of them to pay into a single pot to cover it
517,it does not matter if the car takes control from the driver then the company is responsible the same way that i would be responsible if i grabbed the wheel from you on the m and steered into the middle lane either the driver is in control or the driver is not if companies want to backpedal on how advanced their self driving actually is then they are free to do so but that should not absolve them of responsibility for their actions
518,it does not matter if the car takes control from the driver then the company is responsible the same way that i would be responsible if i grabbed the wheel from you on the m and steered into the middle lane either the driver is in control or the driver is not if companies want to backpedal on how advanced their self driving actually is then they are free to do so but that should not absolve them of responsibility for their actions
519,if a surgeon runs into difficulties during a surgery and hands over responsibility to someone else is the original surgeon liable for what the next person does or fails to do it depends was this a more qualified individual for this particular situation did they give the other person fair warning and a proper brief of the situation so there could be a graceful handover or did they drop the scalpel and run out of the room while shouting its your problem now a bleep from a self driving car in a tricky situation feels more like the latter to me
520,if a surgeon runs into difficulties during a surgery and hands over responsibility to someone else is the original surgeon liable for what the next person does or fails to do it depends was this a more qualified individual for this particular situation did they give the other person fair warning and a proper brief of the situation so there could be a graceful handover or did they drop the scalpel and run out of the room while shouting its your problem now a bleep from a self driving car in a tricky situation feels more like the latter to me
521,its pretty easy actually all items that are sold in this country need to pass a certain certification standard you simply write into the lawstandard what a car must be capable of doing to be fit for sale you simply regulate what is required of an automated car like all cars the vehicle must pass an mot this could also include software updates that comply with the standards therefore the company is responsible for the safety of these features while the user is responsible for ensuring the vehicle meets the standard agreed upon
522,read the article this relates to fully self driving cars which are approved by regulators to be self driving it does not relate to the current system of driving assistance where the driver remains responsible
523,yeah this makes me think of a pilot still being responsible if his plane crashes while on autopilot he still has to be attentive
524,easily the manufacturer will insure the car except they wont they wont have any need to insurance is useful for low risk catastrophically costly one offs where when something goes wrong its a struggle to pay for whatever it is from cash flow so for a person car crashes and house fires would be those things for the likes of ford and toyota however absorbing the cost of much much lower risk autonomous vehicle car crashes would be near negligible and so absorbed by routine cash flow we are still a couple decades away from autonomous vehicle safety reaching this point but eventually they will kill off the car insurance industry
525,we all know the insurers will double dip and say that both the manufacturer and driver need insurance throw in additional fees for the driver for handling claims just because
526,car insurance is compulsory due to the high rate of expensive accidents otherwise it wouldnt be needed it isnt compulsory for bikespramsroller skates because the rate of claims would be vastly exceeded by admin costs so yes with safe cars insurance could cease although probably wouldnt since old habits die hard
527,what do you think the payout rates of insurance companies are
528,you would have been responsible for stopping the car speeding up to mph if you are supposed to be supervising you must be supervising all of the time not just when an accident happens you would be responsible for ensuring not only that there isnt an accident but that the vehicle is driving safely if the car is doing up to a blind corner then you have failed to supervise
529,they used the persons background just to make her look bad i dont think the person was responsible the company was theres no way even if the person hadnt been looking at their cell phone that they could have avoided hitting the pedestrian nobody has reflexes like that not even a machine apparently
530,i think you are on the money with this comment there is no need for a company like toyota to pay a much smaller insurance company to take risk off its books there will be a place for re insurance i expect in the event of large scale issues imagine a large class action lawsuit due to a software glitch in the us
531,absorbing the cost of much much lower risk autonomous vehicle car crashes would be near negligible and so absorbed by routine cash flow really i find it hard to believe these large companies will open the doors to liability sure all the expected events are one thing but to open the door to the unforseen that itself could be catastrophic
532,if there were no car insurance youd be at risk of any idiot wrecking your valuable car and simply then losing it the ways of wrangling out of court claims are massive and they could have no assets anyway
533,okay ill re phrase that because to me it was clear we were talking about normal individual people you dont think car insurance should be a legal requirement for normal individual people and im asking about it currently not if extremely safe self driving cars become the norm also as of it seems like royal mail have some amount of third party liability car insurance too
534,okay ill re phrase that because to me it was clear we were talking about normal individual people you dont think car insurance should be a legal requirement for normal individual people and im asking about it currently not if extremely safe self driving cars become the norm also as of it seems like royal mail have some amount of third party liability car insurance too
535,right if the manufacturer is to take full legal responsibility for level then it makes sense as that suggests no human oversight at all is required otherwise its saying a human driver still has some responsibility
536,there will be a place for re insurance i expect in the event of large scale issues imagine a large class action lawsuit due to a software glitch in the us i doubt anyone would be willing to insure them for that though anything that would be too costly for toyota to bear would also be too big for an insurer to bear and the risk of that occurring would be unquantifiable
537,its legally needed so a base government level national insurance should cover the absolute basics the private entitys take over the additional extras courtesy cars private rehab and physio theft and damage government level just to cover health private for private needs and property
538,i think ultimately these responsibilities will delay the fully automated driving with these companies just trying to avoid that potential liability and we will end up with a lot of cars that could be classified as level but still retaining human controls to avoid the manufacturer taking that leap im not sure whats best a lot of drivers are already driving distracted so it may end up making things much safer even if its not ideal
539,the chinese ones in this vid have lidar whereas tesla are doing it all with video and some ultrasound i think i think we will have some level teething issues before level level is unambiguously the car companys responsibility
540,oh i dont know the reinsurance industry is extremely large they underwrite natural disaster policies which wouldnt be much different to what we are talking about maybe even larger
541,i think youre underestimating the capacity of the insurance industry and also the fact that quite often a large risk will be split up into sections and distributed across multiple insurers
542,unless theyve changed it you dont actually need insurance to drive you can give a bond instead which i think is k the text is in the road traffic act although it is possible it has been repealed and im not aware
543,so is that cost the same for everyone or based on a persons risk the absolute basics you mention i take it you mean third party damage or are you not including loss of income and care costs to third parties because i would say that that should be included in basic coverage that is the main cost of car insurance so although it is the basic amount that is needed it makes up most of the cost why is it different to say food sure that is not legally needed but clearly needed sustain life or do you think that should also be provided not for profit
544,but the person i replied to talked about insurance companies not being able to make you pay anymore and i asked if they thought car insurance shouldnt be compulsory like it is now
545,it will probably come down to the manufacturer wanting to market the vehicle as fully autonomous verses not wanting to take responsibility for crashes i guess they will see which one they belive will make the moat profit
546,okay well i agree a basic provision of good food from the government is not a bad thing i just think car insurance is not top of the list of things the government should provide but currently dont one problem is that if you charge everyone the same amount is moral hazard or maybe its called something else but high insurance costs keep certain drivers off the road if suddenly it cost the same or was free at the point of use for everyone then you could expect more bad drivers on the road and higher crashes and deaths if you do base it on risk similar to now the problem you get is that you will only get one price currently there are lots of companies offering a quote for you so what you may find is that it actually becomes more expensive for certain people thats because each insurance company currently takes a slightly different view on risk i get the point that if its legally needed why should there be a profit made from it thought but i think loads of things are needed to different degrees where profit is currently made
547,when a tesla hit a firetruck while on autopilot it accurately recorded what happened and how autopilot failed to recognize the firetruck the only reason the driver was responsible is because he had the ability to take over but did not do so because he was eating a fucking bagel behind the wheel
548,i dont know if there is a change of view they would have to retrofit lidar to all their cars if so the graphics i have seen of a teslas view of the roads look as impressive as those of waymo or baidhu that said i am just a little sceptical that anyone has managed to overcome the problem of a car driving at level able to deal with any ordinary driving occurrence but it needs to be able to safely transfer control with extreme reliability when something outside its experience happens
549,what about tying accidents to the points system on your licence do many in a period of time and you have to retake the test or re education like speed awareness classes im not sure you would have more bad drivers those same bad drivers exist but now they only pay more if that poor driving impacts somebody else you could be terrible but as long as you dont get caught speeding or are lucky enough for other drivers to compensate for each mistake then you are on the same footing as a perfectly competent driver the one price problem is something that while i have no evidence for feel like theres a certain level of collusion to the way insurance is calculated for example mce just had their underwriters pull out being the company offering way lower than others it looks like its not viable to be the cheapest and taking on anyone even with a huge excess
550,what about tying accidents to the points system on your licence do many in a period of time and you have to retake the test or re education like speed awareness classes the problem is those accidents have already happened risk based pricing segments the population to give the same price to similar people well its only the same if all the variables match but it will give largely similar prices to similar people this information is known ahead of time ie before an accident occurs of course once claims happen past claims will also be used to determine price but many people will get very high insurance without having a claim xb im not sure you would have more bad drivers those same bad drivers exist but now they only pay more if that poor driving impacts somebody else you could be terrible but as long as you dont get caught speeding or are lucky enough for other drivers to compensate for each mistake then you are on the same footing as a perfectly competent driver so yes and no if you segment by age and occupation and postcode and other factors you will see a big difference in the frequency and severity of crashes of these people so these people would pay way more than and older person with no claims history yet neither of these people have ever caused any issues for other drivers on the road xb the one price problem is something that while i have no evidence for feel like theres a certain level of collusion to the way insurance is calculated why there currently isnt a one price problem im saying if the government did it on a risk based approach you would only get one price currently you can go on compare the market or whatever and gets loads of different prices insurers will react to other insurers prices changes for lots of reasons including the other insurers have increased prices and so they know something we dont like wise for decreasing prices they are currently too competitive and dont want to take on any new business as we do not have the staffing levels to maintain a good quality of customer service similarly they may decrease prices not because the risk has decreased but because they simply want to grow the business if all the insurance companies were very good at pricing the risk correctly you would expect all the prices return to be very similar but that not the case as all insurers have different target markets and business strategies they have different risk models with different risk variables going into those models
551,yeah we wouldnt want people to learn to be responsible drivers
552,people have had over a century to show that they will become responsible drivers so far weve failed if autonomous vehicles can substantially cut down on the thousands of people killed every month enwikipediaorgwikimotor_vehicle_fatality_rate_in_us_by_year then all hail our autonomous driving overlords
553,im all for killing auto insurance companies
554,im not sure of the risk is removed yet automotive deaths are already approaching the lowest ever numbers well since traffic became a think combine with us not knowing where the self driving ceiling will be i think auto insurance is going to last a while and then itll just be a liability shift we wont stop having accidents reality just doesnt allow for that claim maybe states will all become no fault states and your insurance covers your car maybe there will still be liability coverage for as others mentioned badly maintained vehicles causing harm i dont love insurance companies but as long as things go bad theres a market for mitigating the damages

556,liabilities are still going to exist what happens when your brand new tesla gets slammed into by a self driving car that some kid got used for cheap and the lydar system is shot what happens when you upload uber into your car so it can go earn some cash for you while you sleep and a freak event occurs your car has to choose between killing one or ten who is responsible for the death you uber the car manufacturer i want self driving cars more than anything but the fact that some people take shit care of their cars means crashes could still happen
557,insurance is what will finally lead to the elimination of drivers as they become a smaller and smaller percentage of cars on the road their premiums will increase and eventually become completely unaffordable
558,the good news for the industry is that it has time stevens estimates that by there will be only million autonomous vehicles on american roadsless than percent of todays total and as of now the technology required for autonomous features is extremely expensive to repair meaning premiums will initially rise as more cars featuring them roll off dealers lots this is the lie they tell themselves and their investors million autonomous vehicles in fleets could handle the transit needs for about million people this is pretty close to the total population of the us the article doesnt even entertain the idea that maybe sdc fleets are the future and not individually owned cars this is probably because the insurance contacts steered away from this being a possibility at all they realize that if this does happen there really is no insurance industry as we know it today left the rest of the article is basically an argument for why you wont own an sdc unless you are rich and really want to as automation reaches levels and fully autonomous capability with the option for a human driver to take over and fully autonomous with no human involvement respectivelyinsurance is going to change dramatically it wouldnt be an article without the reporter messing up the sae levels i dont blame the reporting sae leaves are useless for talking about avs not since we came up with the rules for what is a fruit or a vegetable did humans create a more useless and confusing taxonomy
559,insurance companies dont produce value insurance companies dont produce value insurance companies dont produce value except i guess technically they invest the money thats being spent on premiums so thats value too i guess
560,from the seminars i have attended more and more of the sdc will be owned by either the manufacturer or a service or a hybrid the vehicles will be too expensive for the average person to own also ride sharing will increase so that after the car drops you off at work it goes into taxi mode and services the next rider we will all just have ride share subscriptions instead of car payments with a range of vehicles and levels of service under this model insurance would slowly transition from personal owned vehicles to fleet vehicles of course there will be individual self owned sdc but from what ive seen thats not where its moving in the long term
561,those cars pose a risk to the fabric of society not conceived of in modern times the insurance companies are not going anywhere a bunch of monopolistic hopefuls these orwellian companies that work on this tech represent these cars on a highway at high speeds represents an unfathomable level of damage that could be done why is this tech not sold as human augmentation as to help drivers do their job better or not dui its sold as a complete replacement theres no middle level where humans have this tech available to increase performance that shows the intent of these evil companies they want monopolies and to control transport just like the taxi companies did just in a new package that has a technological moat around it that whole industry is a metastasizing virtual tumor for the future to deal with
562,just got a new truck with the new safety features and the insurance is cheaper than my year old truck in guessing because of the new safety features
563,i see the insurance cost being carried by the car manufacturer if a car is self driving and i have no input why would i carry a liability insurance policy if my only decision is to go from point a to point b then i shouldnt have any liability for any accidents caused by car software etc and shouldnt have to pay for a policy of course the government is the government and theyll be pushed by insurance company lobbyists to still require that car owners hold liability insurance i figure itll take a few decades before people start realizing that nobodys personal liability insurance paid out in a long time and shouldnt be required either that or the rates will be so low that it just wont matter

565,what happens when you upload uber into your car so it can go earn some cash for you while you sleep and a freak event occurs your car has to choose between killing one or ten who is responsible for the death this railroad switch gets thrown around a lot but the self driving car will never ever choose who to run over it will use all available traction to stop while staying in its designated lane of travel someone will kill themselves by leaping under a sdc sooner or later but the sdc wont end up being liable in that specific case just as a human driver wouldnt be liable
566,what happens when you upload uber into your car so it can go earn some cash for you while you sleep and a freak event occurs your car has to choose between killing one or ten who is responsible for the death this railroad switch gets thrown around a lot but the self driving car will never ever choose who to run over it will use all available traction to stop while staying in its designated lane of travel someone will kill themselves by leaping under a sdc sooner or later but the sdc wont end up being liable in that specific case just as a human driver wouldnt be liable
567,insurance companies provide a service which protects value and the ability to provide that service in turn creates shareholder value im not saying i love insurance companies but thats the business model
568,and it is precisely those collision statistics mortality charts and actuarial tables that decide the premiumsdeductibles as the total number of collisions go down but rate of human caused collisions still remains the same the expected payout per contract per year goes down as expected payout goes down ethics boards and regulations will push premiums and deductibles down but only for autonomous vehicles vehicles piloted by humans and their insurance plans will have a smaller pool as the ubiquity of avs grows which skyrockets the coefficient of variation since median grows like on and standard deviation grows with osqrtn associated with insuring non avs this adds a lot of risk to insurance companies making the feasibility of insuring human drivers go down so youll get a few outcomes insurance companies refusing to insure human drivers massive premiumsdeductibles when they do insure humans and a market pressure to buyreplace non avs with avs whenever a write off takes place also eventually well get a generation of teenagers whose parents refuse to pay the cost of insuring young drivers that is a generation in which a growing incidence never get behind a wheel and have always only known autonomous vehicles
569,insurance companies work because most people usually just pay their premiums and dont file any claims without those people subsidizing the claims rates will increase dramatically
570,i know youre being sarcastic but states regulate insurance companies and often have limits on how much they can charge in relation to their payouts so in a number of states insurance companies wont be able to just charge a billion dollars if its only paying out million once self driving cars become common my guess is well have a lot a consolidation in the auto insurance industry its likely everything will just be online maybe youll just pick a company when you register your car and pay for the year altogether
571,hug frequency trading provides liquidity when it is least needed recall the flash crash all the high frequency traders stopped trading in a flash its like flood insurance that does not pay when an flood hits your city
572,nope this has happened to both our cars a couple of years ago we got a minivan with newer safety features and it was about k more than our year jeep when new and insurance also went down im talking just a little bit down but until these two last cars i had never bought a car before and had insurance drop
573,be more expensive because of the higher price of electronics and the larger number of electronics in newer cars i am not an insurance expert so i can not comment on the price of car repair accident rate implication the price of human repair accident rate should definitely be impacting the insurance prices humans are expensive af to fix
574,the real liability expense is injury an extra or whatever for bumper sensor replacement pales in comparison to the costs avoided by not hitting a pedestrian or by not weaving out of your lane
575,except you dont need that many drivers on the road to spread the risk even if of people stop driving thats still million cars that need insurance not to mention the fact accident rates for those drivers are likely to go down
576,also any company would be free to sell cheaper insurance since they wouldnt have as many payouts a new insurer tesla for example could offer a super cheap self driving insurance policy that would undercut existing insurance companies if they tried to keep their rates artificially high
577,profit is margin volume expenses if the volume falls far enough even a profitable product might not generate enough money to be worthwhile i could sell hamburgers off my bbq at the same margin as mcdonalds but the volume means its just not worth the effort as the number of people buying insurance drops you should expect margins to be increased in compensation that will drive more people away from insurance in a cycle with a feedback loop that eventually makes it impossible to get insurance thats what happens with pellet stoves and home insurance the extra cost is way beyond the actuarial risk but so few people have pellet stoves that companies have to jack the premium to make it worth the effort
578,if of the population stop driving and use the service they will probably view the remaining as a nuisance and will drastically regulate the hell out of them from prohibiting them from driving on freeways to raising their insurance liability to several million dollars to charging them high rates for downtown parking which will become more scarce
579,if of the population stop driving and use the service they will probably view the remaining as a nuisance and will drastically regulate the hell out of them from prohibiting them from driving on freeways to raising their insurance liability to several million dollars to charging them high rates for downtown parking which will become more scarce
580,its also worth noting that to a certain extent insurance companies are actually investment companies the insurance is just a mechanism for obtaining large sums of money to invest considered this way its clear that insurance companies are actually more sensitive to a reduction in the size of the pool than would be true if considering them as just insurance companies obviously im simplifying the complexity of a modern insurance firm for illustrative purposes
581,perhaps but my argument was only addressing insurance premiums
582,i tend to agree that itll be a long time before manual insurance becomes truly unaffordable
583,when the sdcs hit majority of vehicle miles traveled i expect it to be very common for voters to insist that their municipalities regulate human drivers from making car registration drastically more expensive to making getting a drivers license more difficult to drastically raising the insurance requirement from in most states to several million to massive fines for violating the rules of the road or wreckless driving i expect things like blowing through a stop sign to have a several thousand dollar ticket and wreckless driving to carry criminal penalties when the majority of americans arent driving and view the remaining drivers as problem they are going to turn on them
584,theyll get it included on the products liability insurance its not a big deal they already warranty their brakes accelerators etc
585,theyll get it included on the products liability insurance its not a big deal they already warranty their brakes accelerators etc
586,all level manufacturers will do this theres no other way it could go first of all a no one wants to be liable for something they have no control over killing someone and b someone will definitely do it case in point and so everyone else will have to to compete
587,its hard to see it ending up any other way at least for fully autonomous cars however when they actually start selling these cars to consumers there are likely to be some catches they havent mentioned yet first if you have a car with a full manual mode ie one where the human is in ultimate control and wont be overridden your obviously not going to be covered by the manufacturer when your in that mode during the transition back to computer driving you also wont be covered for some amount of time to make sure that you didnt put the computer in a situation it cant recover from as a result of your manual control the second major limitation is that there will be strict maintenance requirements possibly even a maintenance contract that you pay in advance and the car will go get itself fixed by an authorized manufacturer approved mechanic likely at a dealership when it decides it needs something fixed even if there is no contract failure to get a problem fixed going to an unapproved mechanic or fixing something yourself may all suspend the manufacturers automatic assumption of liability they may still be liable but they will want the chance to investigate and if necessary disclaim liability it the accident was really the fault of poor repair work unapproved modifications will likewise void coverage

589,this is a bigger issue than anyone has addressed there are already a lot of problems with faulty accelerator computers in existing cars that have caused many accidents and a lot of recalls but it is extremely expensive to prove that your car made the error not your foot so most lawsuits are not economical its not really clear how liability will be determined when a self driving car is involved especially if one of the drivers claims there was a malfunction
590,if the automaker is going to accept responsibility you can bet your ass that every time bug splats on an optic the car will pull over and demand maintenance and refuse to drive in rainsnowfog along the same lines the car will almost certainly require the driver to complete a pre flight checklist like an aircraft before departing tree sap bird droppings dust yard clippings and all kinds of things will interfere with the various sensors while the car sits in your driveway or parking lot or parking garage ive always wondered how that would shake out for privately owned sdcs your car which is full of your personal belongings and bags from other stores drops you off at the grocery store and goes to find a parking spot after youre done shopping for groceries you summon the car with your cell phone or whatever but you get a text message back that says sorry a bird shit on the lidar im miles away good luck kthxbye or you get in to the car in the morning to go to work and it says sorry the sensors are blocked by debris so you get out and wipe everything down and get back in and it still says sorry the sensors are blocked by debris so you go back inside and get some cleaning supplies and properly clean everything and the car still says sorry the sensors are blocked by debris meanwhile your kids are late for school your boss is calling you and youre ready to punch the lidar right in the lens
591,i certainly hope that liability shifts to the manufacturer but there are other ways to do it you could make it a consumer liability by having them bear the costs of insurance making consumer awareness of safety ratings of vehicles important with that being the driver of insurance costs manufacturers would presumably compete to have the safest cars since safer cars translate to lower costs for the consumer being able to tell a consumer hey your insurance would only cost a month with our vehicle providing you in savings over ten years compared to our competitor one reason you might want the liability to at least partly rest with the consumer is to drive consumers to do proper maintenance

593,i think most of us take it as a given that the manufacturer is liable for level volvo is only at level which makes it a bold claim i guess well see if others follow suit
594,i really dont see that its a meaningful difference lets be honest the end customer is paying for it one way or the other the only difference is whether you write the check when you buy the car or you write the check every month its a technicality people spend way too much time worrying about its no different than if you have a limo and a personal driver today youre paying the insurance somebodysomething else is in control the only difference is in the case of a self driving car youre paying way way less for both the driver and the insurance
595,did they i thought they said just mercedes and google http jalopnikcommercedes google volvo to accept liability when their
596,well if we believe volvo then the only possibilities for liability are the sdc is at fault other car object person natural phenomenon etc outside the car is at fault well of course if your car is destroyed you might have to argue with volvo to get a compensation but if we are talking about rd party damages at least you know you will never be considered at fault thats already a huge improvement
597,with the manufacturers covering the insurance the car itself would be cheaper instead the big difference is that a manufacturer can be much more efficient insuring themselves cutting out the insurance companies completely saving billions it also makes things simpler and more convenient to the owners what could happen with liability going to the driver though is that it effectively makes pricing vary a little bit for use patterns someone driving long distances in the city would basically pay more for the higher risk than a lower use customer ideally the difference here should be negligible since neither group should be having many accidents

599,i really dont see that its a meaningful difference as i understand it i may be wrong there is actually a very meaningful difference essentially when you have insurance you can still be liable for a crash if its not your fault and the other person accepts that its usually somewhat straightforward but that isnt always the case it can be your fault your car may even have killed someone you can even go to prison for it even if you dont you can get dragged through court someone can sue you as the driver of the car because even with insurance you are the defending party what volvo are saying is that they are not just covering the insurance cost in the price of the car but they are actually taking liability for accidents which can save you days or weeks of your life if something goes wrong not just a few dollars that means if your car drives into a person and kills them then volvo will step in and say hey sorry thats our fault well deal with the court case i think theres a pretty meaningful difference there than just having an insurance policy on your car right
600,i really dont see that its a meaningful difference as i understand it i may be wrong there is actually a very meaningful difference essentially when you have insurance you can still be liable for a crash if its not your fault and the other person accepts that its usually somewhat straightforward but that isnt always the case it can be your fault your car may even have killed someone you can even go to prison for it even if you dont you can get dragged through court someone can sue you as the driver of the car because even with insurance you are the defending party what volvo are saying is that they are not just covering the insurance cost in the price of the car but they are actually taking liability for accidents which can save you days or weeks of your life if something goes wrong not just a few dollars that means if your car drives into a person and kills them then volvo will step in and say hey sorry thats our fault well deal with the court case i think theres a pretty meaningful difference there than just having an insurance policy on your car right

602,ive been thinking that self driving cars wont kill car mechanics but will usher in an era of highly certified car mechanics i think of airplane mechanics who work on highly reliable parts that peoples lives depend on
603,even todays car mechanics very rarely crack out the welder even for the purely mechanical parts replacement is the way to go for safety and reliability reasons
604,im suggesting the end user would be purchasing the insurance like they do now im not entirely sure how taxi companies insure their fleets now but buying in bulk would reduce the cost per vehicle individual owners could be forced to insure their vehicles like we do now however if a company was to sell a pre insured vehicle with out significant increase in price they would have an advantage and others may follow suit if not id imagine well follow a similar insurance model as we have now though insurance should be significantly cheaper
605,legal liability isnt something that can be transferred between people or corporations for example i cant sign a contract with you saying ill take the blame if you get caught robbing a bank sure financial liability can be assumed but thats what insurance is anyway theres little meaningful difference there nothing volvo does can prevent people from going after you legally or financially to the extent they feel you had any wrongdoing regardless of who is paying for insurance or who says theyre liable likewise if youre paying for the insurance that doesnt mean the manufacturer cant be sued or prosecuted to the extent of any perceived wrongdoing and in fact that happens all the time today tldr its who is actually to blame that is important not who signs a check or says i take blame i have sent this question to my girlfriend who is a lawyer just to make sure though and ill update if she at all disagrees

608,remember that insurance would be a lot cheaper with an automated car since of accidents are caused by human error also i assume as a matter of marketing the insurance cost would be broken out from the price of the car so as to not inflate the price so essentially a potential buyer would be able to compare the cost of getting insurance bundled with the car to getting it independently due to the economies of scale the cost of getting it bundled should be cheaper
609,yeah i get that the person at fault is ultimately the one responsible but just consider a case today if the brakes fail on your car the car hits someone the manufacturer is technically responsible and ultimately liable but its not that simple is it theyre not going to come to your defence youll get in a lot of bother in the mean time and it may be that no one even believes you the manufacturer might try to deny any wrongdoing and weasel their way out of admitting a fault in the brakes this is actually very common with automobile faults its a nightmare to get them to admit a fault cos it usually means an expensive recall too now if they are accepting liability from the get go even if someone can still sue you the point is that they would be wasting their time and most likely wouldnt even bother cos they know volvo will be the end result of that anyway and with volvo already contractually obliged to be liable youll find way less hassle for yourself too as they deal with it even if the legal situation doesnt change i think the manufacturer taking it on in this way would make a huge difference to the actual process in the real world
610,yeah i get that the person at fault is ultimately the one responsible but just consider a case today if the brakes fail on your car the car hits someone the manufacturer is technically responsible and ultimately liable but its not that simple is it theyre not going to come to your defence youll get in a lot of bother in the mean time and it may be that no one even believes you the manufacturer might try to deny any wrongdoing and weasel their way out of admitting a fault in the brakes this is actually very common with automobile faults its a nightmare to get them to admit a fault cos it usually means an expensive recall too now if they are accepting liability from the get go even if someone can still sue you the point is that they would be wasting their time and most likely wouldnt even bother cos they know volvo will be the end result of that anyway and with volvo already contractually obliged to be liable youll find way less hassle for yourself too as they deal with it even if the legal situation doesnt change i think the manufacturer taking it on in this way would make a huge difference to the actual process in the real world

612,the problem ive always seen is that i think most or possibly all due to legal requirements privately owned early sdcs are likely to have a manual drive mode i find it unlikely automakers are going to insure people driving themselves that would mean if the makers insure the autonomous driving then you have to have two separate insurance policies and that just seems undesirable but at the end of the day i really do think we spend way too much time discussing this issue the cars will be insured one way or another the end user is going to be paying for it at the end of the day if the manufacturers are going to be the actual provider of the insurance great i guess but its one of the least interesting issues to talk about imo
613,theyre not going to come to your defence no thats what insurance is for its just a matter of which company has your back i know countless people that have had wrecks none with appropriate insurance have ever suffered any real financial liability i do know some that have suffered criminal liability for doing something stupid but that is affected by who assumes responsibility for insuring the vehicle and lets be honest even if it is you footing the insurance if your car was the one driving if its coming to a lawsuit as opposed to just damages which are routinely handled by insurance its the software and hardware makers theyre going to be going after regardless as theyre the ones with money and unless you did something wrong theyre obviously the ones at fault if such a thing exists its important to remember not every accident has to have somebody at fault bad shit happens sometimes and if you are somehow actually at fault say for not properly maintaining the vehicle then of course theyre going to go after you again whether the vehicle is insured through the manufacturer or not in fact youll probably have the manufacturer after your hide now too look im not saying im opposed to manufacturers self insuring or even that it wont prove to be a somewhat better choice im just saying people get way too worked up about it and its not that big a deal the vehicles will be insured and if end users have to write the check themselves no big deal remember youre paying for it one way or another directly or indirectly there are even advantages to doing it yourself particularly if you have to have insurance for when you self drive anyway you get to shop based on price and service you can choose a plan commensurate with the amount of risk youre willing to accept you can change insurance companies if youre unhappy etc at any rate its not some massive problem thats impossible to solve and will be impossible to solve and cause problems with adoption of sdcs as some people seem to think its a relatively minor procedural decision with multiple reasonable solutions

616,yea im only talking about fully automated cars specifically im thinking about googles cars they have the money to do the insurance themselves and like i said it would give them a marketing advantage
617,if youre talking about fleet service its even more moot to the end user somebody else is going to be paying for the insurance directly regardless and it will be rolled into the fee the same way
618,youre damn right this supposed dilemma has no relevance to anyone making an sdc in real life youd think anyone who has been driving a car for years without having to make a similar decision would understand this right away but its still every armchair pundits favourite talking point especially if you meet someone socially and you tell them you work on sdcs but this isnt even the trolley problem the original form of the trolley problem is that you have to choose between letting the trolley kill n people but its not your fault or switching tracks so it will kill person but you did it at its heart its a question about acts of commission vs omission blame and liability and its been the core of the auto industrys approach to driver assist for at least the last years probably longer the corresponding dilemma for the auto industry is this say you have a new emergency braking system that prevents some percentage of fatal accidents so if you deployed it in all new cars it would save x lives per year but its not a perfect system so sometimes it might brake or swerve unnecessarily costing y lives per year but the x deaths that happen if you do nothing are not your fault or as the legal system works youre not liable for them whereas the y deaths that might happen would definitely leave the manufacturer liable in a perfect world maybe the choice of whether to ship the system would be whether x y maybe youd take into account some other factors like it would make people drive more recklessly endangering more lives that you hadnt accounted for or the deaths caused by the system are more or less traumatic for drivers that could be an interesting moral discussion but the auto industrys solution to this is that you only ship the system if y theyre quite happy for drivers to kill any number of people with their cars so long as the manufacturer isnt liable the number one phrase used by people who write safety critical software for the legacy auto industry is but what if it makes it crash into a bus full of lawyers children thats why the first aeb systems only started braking after the driver did and its why the idea of robotaxis where theres no driver to shift liability to is so disruptive to the industry its still not very relevant to anyones day to day work as an sdc engineer but the trolley problem well a legalistic reading of it is key to the formation of the sdc industry

620,the problem with adding ai to collision avoidance is that it puts the liability on the auto manufacturer once the manufacturer starts putting in code to recognize certain objects eg humans vs cars then it could be argued that the automaker is responsible for pedestrian deaths for that reason you may not see such a sophisticated avoidance system until it is mandated by the government and the government sets the guidelines for priority of avoidance then automakers will be able to say in court our software swerved out of the way of the oncoming wheeler and hit the pedestrian because according to government guidelines thats how its supposed to work until such time collision avoidance will work on avoiding the closest object to the front bumper and if it swerves to avoid something and ends up hitting something else theres no intelligence behind it to say it was a wrong choice to swerve

622,agree that the car making a decision argument is unrealistic it sort of assumes that the programmer is writing code like if baby_in_street break_left_maverick thats not how self driving systems are created the real dilemma is legal if youre at the wheel of a level car and youre at fault in an accident you are liable if youre a passenger in a level car and the car crashes into a sidewalk of people who is liable the owner the front seat passenger the back seat passenger the manufacturer thats a bigger quandary that must be resolved
623,yeah no idea why you got downvoted even if it doesnt really play into how sdc engineers actually build and train driving algorithms it comes up on the legal side of things when discussing liability in that sense its extremely relevant though i think that well see corporations overpower our government on this one before and really laws can be debated and swift cultural change will come that allows us to accept self driving fatalities
624,sure the tech is there and easy enough a person and a car look very different but look at how isps handle controversial content they could easily create blocklists for all of the kiddie porn sites they know about out there they dont why because it creates liability issues for them then they have to explain in court why some sites are blocked but not others the easiest path for them is to do no blocking at all
625,car insurance companies would do well by buying partial ownership of automated car companies and the technology
626,why would he not be having a party doesnt that slash his payouts making insurance cash flows more stable
627,auto insurance is a free market mostly premiums are based on costs ideally you collect more in premiums than you pay out for accidents if people arent having accidents insurance companies will lower premiums so they can better compete on price the total market shrinks many insurance companies will go out of business the ones that remain will have smaller costs but also smaller revenues
628,interesting i did not know that still it should be a non issue from the link you provided however on appeal the court ruled that the jury should be able to decide whether based on the facts and circumstances of this case and the characteristics of this child ted could be held to have been negligent the child stepping out in front of the car should have automatically caused the car to brake faster than any human could all of which would have been recorded id say that that should be enough mitigating circumstances to avoid fault however this brings up another important point none of this is unique to sdcs the legal system has already developed laws and rules for dealing with these cases presumably these laws and rules are considered the right thing to do in such circumstances and automated cars will be able to carry out that expected behavior better than any human could the only issue i can see is when the law makes a distinction between the correct action based on some criteria that a sdc cant determine for instance if the law was to say that you should crash your car into another car if it was a child in the way but hit the pedestrian if they were an adult then that would cause a problem if the car could not determine the age of the pedestrian im no lawyer but i have a hard time believing such an interpretation of the law would be correct regardless of the childs tort liability there has to be a presumptive defense that a driver doesnt have to endanger their life by getting into a head on crash in order to protect a child
629,while i agree with you with respect to legal obligation an automated system can actually do more sophisticated calculations than that based on potentially factors like the make and model of vehicles involved velocity and angle of collision etc with the intent of maximizing human survival and health rather than minimizing legal liability
630,vtadvfcjcm just to return to this there is a lot mitigating head on collisions nowadays its called fucking engineering in no world is it acceptable to run over a fucking child because insurance we have technology that protects people in impacts if we must have an impact we do it with the least worst option in mind
631,minimizing legal liability is what we as a society have decided is the right thing to do you also have to remember the context in which im making these statements buffet said that these types of situations would be a hinderance to sdc adoption im saying they wont because we as a society have already decided what the solution should be these situations are not unique to sdcs in addition simply breaking with a perception and reaction time greater than any human is a perfectly acceptable solution no sdc is going to get in trouble with the law for not swerving into oncoming traffic also no emergency driver assistance system on a car today would even think about swerving and nobody bats an eye if anything would be a hinderance to sdc adoption it would be if people knew that their car was designed to crash into oncoming traffic for the benefit of someone else so i say again the solution is simple the car should break as hard as it can and hit the child there is no legal problem with doing that and that policy isnt going to spook potential ownerspassengers of the car

634,copied response below from another reply ill also add that you arent under any responsibility to injure yourself to help someone else even more importantly you definitely shouldnt injure an innocent third party to protect someone else we wont program these cars to be heros well program them for the minimum legal liability and greatest passenger safety minimizing legal liability is what we as a society have decided is the right thing to do you also have to remember the context in which im making these statements buffet said that these types of situations would be a hinderance to sdc adoption im saying they wont because we as a society have already decided what the solution should be these situations are not unique to sdcs in addition simply breaking with a perception and reaction time greater than any human is a perfectly acceptable solution no sdc is going to get in trouble with the law for not swerving into oncoming traffic also no emergency driver assistance system on a car today would even think about swerving and nobody bats an eye if anything would be a hinderance to sdc adoption it would be if people knew that their car was designed to crash into oncoming traffic for the benefit of someone else so i say again the solution is simple the car should break as hard as it can and hit the child there is no legal problem with doing that and that policy isnt going to spook potential ownerspassengers of the car

636,its simply a matter of your opinion and very strange ethics oh well i tried luckily you are not an insurance expert or executive nor are you developing these self driving solutions
637,waymo already does cars in arizona without safety drivers but they are rolling out the commercial service this year they also have k cars on order and then a deal with honda you do not buy cars to have them sit in a garage somewhere they also have worked out insurance munich re taking the risk maintenance with avis and then several other partnerships for the service
638,makes sense i also forgot that those caps arent really reliable because of all the rules around how contractors need to be treated differently than employees oh well hopefully waymo is really far along with their driverless tech and ill get to use the service soon by the way it just dawned on me that as a germaphobe if everything turns into ride share i may spend much more of my day uncomfortable
639,you arent going to generate clicks with that title try entitled millennials destroy insurance industry or maybe organ transplants drop due to entitled millennials something like that
640,when in years yes a law banning standard cars would weigh heavily on those without money if someone cant afford the new tech and you take away their ability to get to their job you havent increased their health or probability of long term survival in years maybe not but i would expect insurance companies will have taken care of the issue long before then as they dont really care about long term survival unless they are the ones insuring it
641,why would you want to own a self driving car you dont there are maintenance costs insurance costs it takes room stands idle for most time once they are everywhere you just share it order it like a taxi it comes takes you somewhere and you leave it while it goes for another passenger without you having to wonder about parking costs
642,while i agree with the above post that the average age of a car in the us is years that doesnt mean it will remain that way as the symbiotic relationship between sdcs and electric cars are relaized you can buy a chevy bolt today for less than k and it will cost you about year for depreciation electric insurance maintenancetires a new ice car will cost closer to kyear because of gas and higher maintenance but outside of a tesla electric is still a hard sell because consumers are unsure how it will workout for them as sdcs are rolled out as a service its much easier for a consumer to dip their toes into the electric car pool since they arent committing to a huge capital investment as consumers decide that an sdc fleet works for them as their nd or rd car and for some all their cars the average age of cars on the road should fall pretty fast as the nd and rd cars are mostly where these older cars are each car you own has to justify you spending k kyear on them when you can spend k kyear using an sdc fleet try this first figure up how much each of your cars cost you per year by calculating the depreciation gas costs insurance costs maintenance taxes etc this should be between k k even if you have a year old beater like i do then ask yourself if you would keep paying this if you had an uber like service where you could request and have a car in your driveway within minutes that would take you anywhere in town for would you keep your car
643,im betting on a deflationary spiral from several factors insurance skyrocketing due to self selection police getting more and more desperate as sdcs drop out of the ticket revenue stream seeing skyrocketing risks and costs for manual drivers demand for conversion kits skyrocketing as people compete to put their cars to work making side income i predict some sdc platforms will participate in government snitch programs to keep each other honest but between them the fallible human will be squeezed out of the game when it becomes the last most drivers will be the worst of the worst either the poor and doesnt care or the rich and doesnt care at that point passing that no human driver law is a hell of a lot easier
644,ummm lots of people dont like to ride around in other peoples filth if they dont have to lots of people dont want to wait the time it might take to have a cab dispatched especially during peak periods parking costs its not like my driveway is going to disappear anytime soon and most americans dont live in high density urban areas most of the arguments made for self driving cars are also arguments for much stronger public transportation networks in urban cities and intercity rail networks for connecting those cities all technology that is quite well proven not controversial incredibly safe and relatively inexpensive the self driving advocates are starting to push the shared ownership model because it is becoming increasingly apparent that self driving cars will not be deliverable at unit costs of less than figures theyre trying to in any way possible rationalize the high cost of a self driving vehicle to support further public equity market funding of self driving car research in the context of the lack of an otherwise viable business case btw maintenance costs on a car are largely a function of miles driven and are almost certainly to be dramatically greater for self driving cars due to the extra required redundancy safety systems and the life critical nature of their components insurance costs are highly correlated to miles driven long term interest rates are low so there is little downside to low capital intensity and cars are cheaper than ever those worried about capital intensity can simply buy cheaper cars what about all the extra fuel that a taxi cab fleet takes to move from user to user ever consider that will higher capital utilization intensity of a very expensive asset a sdc with high operating costs be better than a cheap asset a human driven car used very unintensively
645,it should be part of the cars responsibility to drive in a way that accounts for other drivers behavior its a failure of the google cars if they keep getting rear ended in a situation where a human would not have been rear ended
646,in the case of rear ending the person behind is always at fault your main responsibility as a driver is whats happening in front of you or your direction of travel you cant control whats happening behind you the best you can manage is getting out of the way of a tailgater asap which isnt always possible if someone has rear ended a google car then i can guarantee you that they werent paying attention or they were driving too closetoo fast to react just the same way i can guarantee you that the guy that rear ended me not long ago was doing just the same my dad has also been rear ended a number of times while at a complete stop either at a traffic light or waiting at a roundabout driving a whopping great hard to miss landrover there was literally nothing he could have done to prevent them unless he could somehow read the mind of the person about to hit him
647,when there is no video evidence and its just your word against mine who is the insurance going to side with but it also isnt just inattentiveness it could be speeding following to closely lack of maintenance on their car bad brakestires require a longer stopping distance sometimes you have a scenario on like a highway where a car cuts you off and slams on their brakes to force a collision every accident is different with different circumstances you cant say its always the fault of the person behind
648,its perfectly moral to react by plowing into the people to avoid collision also while ianal im not aware of any legal grounds for punishing a driver who makes such a choice to protect themselves if you hit pedestrians with your car you are liable you will be held responsible for their medical bills its that simple
649,its perfectly moral to react by plowing into the people to avoid collision also while ianal im not aware of any legal grounds for punishing a driver who makes such a choice to protect themselves if you hit pedestrians with your car you are liable you will be held responsible for their medical bills its that simple
650,actually its not pedestrians must still show the driver owed them a legal duty of care http injuryfindlawcomcar accidentspedestrian accidents overviewhtml under the circumstances your insurance may always pay out in such circumstances but in terms of your personal legal liability swerving to avoid a collision caused by someone else and running over a pedestrian can be legal

654,im certainly not my example was about the long and often detailed instructions written in natural language that are an essential part of many many traffic signs true reliable comprehension is the challenge here not mere digit recognition
655,how do they define in what vehicles you are allowed to do this in and what vehicles you are not if we ignore sae levels i assume any adas vehicle you are not allowed to do this but only if the vehiclesystem manufacture allows it too and agrees to take liability im wondering where is the text of this new law because i am curious how they define or address this
656,there will always be accidents we cant say a system should never be allowed to make mistakes tesla had a fatality simply because the system could not distinguish a semi truck trailer from the sky at an angle tesla corrected that and moved on there will always be something in the software that needs to be corrected as to why uber isnt accepting responsibility thats because our entire culture is litigious and should they admit fault they open themselves up to crippling lawsuits that could potentially end their autonomous taxi service which since they have actually done nothing worse than any other new technology including their peers would be excessive we really cannot expect every brand new technology to have a perfect fatality free rate and punish every company that fails that by suing them into oblivion but that us the way our current legal and media system works it could even destroy their company so they cant admit fault personally i feel that uber is extending a little far but thats what business does if you arent on the cutting edge then you are being shut out so i at least understand even if i dont agree
657,even if the self driving tech failed and the self driving tech is garbage this accidentdeath is still due to human error a self driving system was not responsible for avoiding hitting pedestrians a human was responsible for avoiding hitting pedestrians and they failed to do so this is only more evidence we need to speed up self driving cars one can make an argument that testing an av system still in development with a human responsible for the vehicle is more dangerous than a regular human driven vehicle however data shows the opposite the accident per mile rate of testing avs is a tiny fraction of the human accident per mile rate and even more so when you consider the majority of av testing is in more complex urban environments more complexity less miles
658,but why are we so hell bent on removing any responsibility from the person who illegally stepped out in front of a car
659,i think by the rules of the road if the uber was a human driver they would be ok this probably means they arent legally liable but they will no doubt pay a tidy settlement to make this go away the issue is that autonomous vehicles should be achieving a higher standard of safety not the legal minimum it might well set back their av program with the regulator
660,i dont think your point of uber going into oblivion seems correct air accidents were common one day eg enmwikipediaorgwikiair_inter_flight_ but that didnt cause airbus to shut down we are today at a point where we dont have a regulatory body governing safety of self driving cars the creators of the technology should take responsibility rather than trying to get the matter to be forgotten
661,a self driving system was not responsible for avoiding hitting pedestrians this is puzzling why do you say that a human was responsible for avoiding hitting pedestrians and they failed to do so i would argue that the human is responsible for avoiding hitting pedestrians iff the av has already failed
662,nobody is she shouldnt have jaywalked multiple parties can be at fault for a collision in this case the woman the driver and uber all seem to have some level of responsibility
663,you are legally liable to not run over pedestrians that you can see and avoid they are absolutely legally liable
664,the self driving system is still in development and is certainly not ready yet to have that kind of responsibility therefore uber did not give it that kind of responsibility
665,i could see the argument if the testing is done on a closed trackcoursefacility but if the testing is done on public roads why would sae levels not apply the important distinction is that for l the car manufacturer is not responsible as you mentioned in this case its kinda moot because the safety driver was an uber employee i wonder if this accident will cause a shift in the industry where everyone fires their safety drivers creates a separate driver staffing company hires their drivers back and puts them back in the cars that way if another accident happens uber can say we are not responsible this was an l car it was being operated by a safety driver and we do not employ him you will have to talk to the staffing company rebu
666,possibly as far as i know none of the several teams investigating this are even close to finishing correct it takes weeks to fully investigate a crash more if theres a delay in getting the black box the pd shouldnt have released anything at all at first incredibly irresponsible
667,the important distinction is that for l the car manufacturer is not responsible as you mentioned in this case its kinda moot because the safety driver was an uber employee correct so in this case it is l because the safety driver is responsible
668,theres no clause liability is usually determined by asking who hit who and who had right of way in the case of a rear end collision both issues are usually cut and dried the main exception is reckless driving in bc this is defined as racing or stunt driving though neither is quite what it sounds like swerving or changing lanes to prevent someone from passing is racing brake checking is stunt driving i think all things considered the tailgater is going to have a very tough hill to climb to prove that the waymo was driving recklessly
669,i gave a broad answer because in the us is very state dependent and theres always the case of other countries which i have some but not much experience with for example ca is a partial fault state so the fact that you cut someone off as reckless driving doesnt reduce the fault of the person behind not keeping a safe distance and being unable to stop in time unless that cut in was done in a way that the driver behind was unable to keep such distance or in most south america countries where it is the driver in the back responsibility to prove the front one was reckless tldr this can get tricky and nuanced quickly very fast to the point it doesnt fit a reddit discussion but i agree with all you said depending on where in the world you are
670,lets just say that almost everywhere in the world and for a very long time far longer than cars have been around the overtaking driverdroverhelmsmanpilotrider is liable by default in the event of a collision maybe theres a few weird statesnothing about america surprises me anymore but it is worth noting that the states only make the traffic laws it is the insurance companies that work out which of them is going to pay the damages they need to agree amongst themselves in a way that works everywhere

672,honestly that the car manufacturer is going to be responsible for accidents car manufacturers are going to lobby so unbelievably hard to get that removed otherwise they cant sell cars in the same quantities as they did before that leaves leasing which is expensive and taxi services
673,regulations regarding when a vehicle is road worthy front white lights yellow trun indicatorswarnings rear red lights horn minimum side mirrors and rear view mirror seatbelts and airbags etc plus clear regulations that arent really followed regarding driving in public roads if you go to any sort of industrial setting vehicles are also fitted yellow strobes on top have mostly designated lanesspaces must be driven by a higher certified driver for the specific vehicle involved and vehicles with lesser visibility require a spotter plus radio comms and supervisors there is also a focus on making streetsinfrastructure safe and predictable all this things combined still make transit related incidents the leading cause of death of youth close to teenagers are killed each year in car crashes nationwide making traffic collisions the leading cause of accidental death among teens ages to according data from the insurance institute for highway safety iihs accidents still leading cause death among teens red flag laws might seem ridiculous from our perspective but the goal of making operating heavy machinery more than ton at high rates of speed kph trough dense urban areas as safe as possible must remain at the heart of when and how we allow vehicles to operate in our communities
674,huh i hadnt heard of openpilot before thats pretty cool but is there not a warrantyinsurance issue with replacing the native software on a safety feature like that feels like you would be totally fucked if you got in a wreck
675,yeah i dont know maybe it wouldnt make a difference but replacing the built in software does seem like it would be a big change if you tried to bring something to court if the oems software screws up they can argue that the driver should have been paying attention but the actual glitch is on one entity if you replace the original software pinning the issue on the software company vs the car manufacturer seems a lot more complicated teslas self driving stuff has only been around since and there are a lot of open cases against them about autopilot enabled accidents it seems premature to say that car manufactures never ever under any circumstances have any liability whatsoever for a malfunctioning ads when were only years in to the technology being introduced
