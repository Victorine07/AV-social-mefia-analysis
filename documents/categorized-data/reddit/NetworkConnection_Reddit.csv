0,well depends what were talking about if were talking private cars its definitely not the solution if were talking public transport it does have an impact im working in this field trying to test autonomous shuttles in connection with existing connections it would make public transport cheaper safer more inclusive and more efficientit would indeed make jobs disappear but part of them will further exist just în the office looking at a few shuttles at a time also we are studying on demand transport and are trying to have a lead start with this before uber and co so that it stays public at the same time we are trying to see how the gathered data can help us its a field worth exploring even if we dont yet know what all the advantages are it could at some point make owning a car obsolete since you can just call a bus through an app
1,if you find a way to signal to others via some type of status symbol that youre frugal and not just poor please let me know seriously ive been thinking it would be a way for frugality to become popular if people could display their success at it to others its gauche to talk about money itself so there would need to be another way
2,i have all i need and could not think of anything else that i want at the moment i have a place to live clothes to wear stuff to eat no debt and funds to pay for my daily expenses but by the usual definition im poor solely because i earn less than x of the average income of my country my conclusion the definition is wrong because i feel rich sure i couldnt afford a house i prefer to rent anyway or a car but i have two bicycles or a fancy holiday trip every year people come to my region for holiday for a reason if i wanted all that id probably feel poor but why on earth should i signal to others how many resources i have and how i spend them im simply not made for this keeping up with the joneses game
3,at some point yes computers are just better than humans at some tasks currently theyre not but they will be and once all cars are autonomous thered be great efficiency gains in terms of traffic much of traffic is caused by human behavior such as braking too hard or lane changing too much which causes ripple effects that caused large slow downs autonomous cars can be connected to a network which controls how each individual car behaves and theyd all drive optimally for the good of all on private roads let people do whatever they want but in public no
4,this is a delicate question it depends on a lot of factors there would be vast differences in attitudes between urban suburban and rural drivers their access to public transport would be vastly different as well and their access to features such as wireless charging accident avoidance infrastructure communication vehicle to vehicle for example would all be different based on whats available also there is a major set of people who enjoy driving this could continue via private roads though which would mostly be a large improvement in liability and safety driving could be a dedicated hobby which may prove out to be excellent compared to today
5,i present to you the official pennsylvania horse and buggy operator manual in california the horse and the rider actually has right of way in many cases if the rider signals for you to slow down and you hit their animal youre held liable in fact they even have new safety laws that went into effect a couple days ago mandating helmets for under riders and reflectors on your horse when riding on the highway after dark new california traffic safety laws sideshows chp
6,depends on in what sense you are referring to lidar pollution there will be no visible effect due to the lasers being in the infrared wavelength range if you mean will there be crosstalk or interference from other nearby lidars in a crowded area that is a possibility but there are methods to get around that issue one way is to use coherent scanning technology which allows the unit to send out a series of pulses with a specific signature encoded into it that the detector can check for when it receives a signal in that way the signals from other nearby lidars wont cause the unit to register false returns
7,i think the question is similar to light and sound pollution even where it doesnt bother humans or weve adapted to it these mess with the natural rhythms and behaviors of other species sometimes to great deleterious effect so are there any species or natural systems that might be impacted by concentrations of lidar signals
8,autonomous vehicles can still operate in the vast majority of the country by area where it would make no sense economically to deploy area level command and control systems autonomous vehicles can operate and improve safety on an individual vehicle level without requiring massive additional infrastructure investment in deployment and ongoing maintenance if a lidar on a vehicle breaks it affects that vehicle if whatever positioning sensor youre deploying at command stations breaks it wrecks the entire area controlled by that station the amount of information required to be collected and transmitted to each vehicle in order to provide overall network optimization is enormous people will definitely not want to participate in a system where their car ends up choosing being commanded in your scenario to sacrifice their own travel time or god forbid safety to improve overall traffic flow against their will these are some of the many reasons why autonomy is the much lower hanging fruit than centralized control
9,um nope you are confusing automotive radar used for things like adaptive cruise control or emergency braking that uses radio waves with lidar which is a totally different beast and uses light in fact most autonomous cars have both systems lidar is usually the spinning thing inside the turret on the roof eg on the waymo cars most often from velodyne radars are typically mounted behind the front grille or under the front bumper lidar is basically a laser range finder but it spins degrees and scans also up and down so it creates a three dimensional map of the surroundings automotive radar cant do that it is has nowhere near the resolution for it due to the much longer wavelength compared to the infrared laser btw automotive radar interference with g and such is very unlikely both because of narrow band filtering and also because these millimeter wave signals are extremely directional so the automotive signals following the road surface are not going to hit the cell towers
10,its entirely possible for a thermal camera to see objects cooler than the cameras sensor in the same way if you stand next to a window when its very cold outside you will feel the cold even if the air in the room is warm due to thermal radiation leaving you if your eye could see radiation your brain would just have to subtract a baseline amount of signal corresponding with your own thermal emission however thermal infrared is very low energy and there are no known opsins light reactive chemicals in eyes which could be activated by thermal radiation those animals which can see heat use other body parts to sense heat which are different to eyes
11,i think the problem is that you cant tell whether the light comes from your own laser or a different vehicle at least not without doing something like an encoded pulsed signal or sensor fusion so even if we have one perfect autonomous vehicle there might need to be some extra work done before we can have thousands
12,yes but none of the g flavors in these high frequency bands are likely to be significantly affected by automotive radar because of the directionality of the signals and where is a typical antenna pointed and the non millimeter wave g in the fr range from mhz to ghz is not going to be affected at all simply because the bandpass filterstuned antennas wont let the much higher frequency radar signal through
13,basically we are really good at detecting very small changes in frequency you have a conceptually similar problem if you have a hundred people in the same room all browsing the internet on their iphones in comparison having a few cars near each other on the road is a relatively minor problem and can actually be beneficial if the cars can share information with each other they become a distributed sensor network and actually provide better performance the more cars you have
14,well im sure you do encoding some sort of amplitude pattern spread spectrum may be a problem if you need to use doppler but i think the better was to approach the problem is just to have a communication channel between the cars if they have synchronized timing information you create a multiple sourcemultiple receiver network
15,using what i now of the communications industry going through a digital communications class right now and the cars the term ultrasonic mean anything beyond hertz ultrasound can go up to mhz hz thats a large spectrum to work off of we can eliminate higher to mhz for fm radio frequencies due to interference from high power radio towers the am spectrum khz to khz can also be eliminated due to hobbyist usage and corporate am towers this still leaves us with a large spectrum if the car detects another car using the same frequency a frequency hop using a different frequency wouldnt be too hard a simple fix would be to have each car send out an identification number and what frequency its using so they could orchestrate frequencies for themselves then the computer can adjust its own band pass filters as for receiving the wrong set of data depending on the clock cycle how many actions a computer performs a second it could have a wait and see period lets assume a clock cycle of mhz actions a second lets make the computer transmit a signal every khz for a duration of khz thats on half the time and off half the time meaning a total of pulses if the receiver is suddenly receiving more and a certain allowable error lets say so pulses the computer will detect and issue and likely frequency hop to avoid such errors but take it with a grain of salt im still a student in this field
16,great answer how badly do differences in material create interferances in the signal echo just as an example what if i were driving behind a truck that had a large foam box hanging out of its trunk could the sensor accidentally interpret the distance to the truck was double my actual distance
17,ive taken a few classes on aircraft radar couldnt you also change the frequency mid broadcast tweet it steadily higher like a bird for example i know the newer aesa radars will do that to help combat certain forms of ew but if you randomly chose a place within your broadcast to tweet the frequency and have that saved off for the signal processing on the receiving end the odds for a single broadcast overlapping on both tricks becomes crazy small
18,how would a signals and systems course relate to knowing this kind of stuff im a mathphysics major but i can take a couple ee electives since they only require differential equations
19,if you have say khz of bandwidth that you can split into hz steps thats frequencies if you randomly hop between them the chances that another sensor will happen to intersect for say consecutive transmission periods becomes tiny i dont think this is quite correct although the odds of the same signal successively interfering with you are low you need to calculate based on any signal interfering with you if youre in a high traffic area there might be say cars near enough to you to interfere if every one of them broadcasts a radar signal in your bandwidth theres a very high chance that each signal will be interfered with even over five or ten successive signals i suppose the numbers here are made up so i dont know what the actual math comes out to but large bi directional traffic jams on large highways or parking lot exits after major events will have very high densities of cars
20,for our radar testing we have large pieces of signal absorbing foam pieces these are used in rf chambers or quiet rooms literally as well for any sort of electromagnetic signals if a truck had this sort of foam hanging around the truck would more or less he invisible because the foam would absorb all of the radar signal stealth craft actually use a radar absorbing paintcoating to be as radar invisible as possible metal vehicles are stronger targets than carbon fiber vehicles material certainly makes a difference
21,that would give you a decent background on bandwidth and modulation schemes and things of that nature which are critical for understanding this but to get into signals stuff specific to radar would also require a class on rf radio frequency but really its shorthand for radio communications and broadcast and probably still more directly focusing on radar its a good start though
22,i dont know how they work but the military has missiles that can home in on jamming signals where the jamming signal is able to confuse their radar they just go for the jamming signal instead this implies deliberate interference is both detectable and locatable somehow also im sure the car is logging or recording all the signals from its sensors in a crash whoever is investigating will download the logs from the car and will see the radar suddenly go weird its entirely possible that this might be regarded as suspicious depending on how the radar works
23,yes youd essentially create a network of vehicles with that if one car sees a pedestrian about to cross the street it could relay that information to all cars in the area so they can all adjust speeds to accommodate the pedestrian before even seeing the person
24,theoretically nothing except the law just like nothing physically stops a person from buying a gps jammer available on ebay http _fromr_trksidpmltrtrchxgpsjammertrs_nkwgpsjammerghosttext_sacat and placing it near an interstate interchange we do have laws against it you cant just transmit whatever em waves youd like this is federally regulated by the fcc and every country has its own regulatory body for it id imagine sabotaging autonomous vehicles systems will be illegal and probably carry harsh punishments also cars would likely have emergency procedures if a car senses autonomous jammers it would send out a distress signal to nearby cars which causes emergency braking procedures by all the nearby vehicles until drivers can get manual controls or something like that
25,this is true but its also pretty much a solved problem any kind of networking over a shared medium requires a similar way for clients to not step on each others toes
26,i imagine people will probably get away with it at first then itll get sorted wouldnt you know the range from the number of cars affected assuming they all log carry cameras and are networked for traffic control in theory everything is scramblable but you want to avoid being caught wouldnt just hacking the system be less risky than actually being on site with a device btw the subject is self driving cars and the central traffic control system they will eventually use not automatic cruise control eg tesla
27,tesla rolled out a fully automatic prototype i believe heard it on rt podcast but assuming the waves used for this echolocation are easily recreatable a homemade device could just be emitting random signals you probably wouldnt be able to easily lock a car signal so the interference would be intermittent that said on a short enough list of frequencies it can cycle quick enough to block out say of what the car can read that means at a stoplight maybe a quarter of those cars get effected and will be recycling frequency if the blocker keeps cycling the only real limit is keeping the signal on long enough to tell the car they cant use it i assume itll ignore a few milliseconds of interference and the odds of collision are also very slim especially since it is required they have manual controls in most cases the mesh network system that will link all cars location can also probably be jammed not cheaply i assume but might make my whole idea moot for all i know i dont know how they plan to pull that off but if its not a satellite link and just lan you can probably mess with that channel too same device several signals now realistically a cheap build you could still probably get several frequencies covered at once that wont be directionally broadcasted without a wide array of points and geometry and even so if you had it in a car or something the likelihood of being mathematically pinpointed as the source is slim and i doubt a detective would find you prosecutable before manufacturers find a workaround you can download to these fancy whips if a manhole was open and letting out hot air nearby pressure changes could change who could be the culprit hacking would require a connection that the car trusts i believe they built the dlc interface to not really do anything except check teslacom for news and updates its pretty locked down and requires approval from the driver forcing a connection installation and hardware control while driving doesnt seem practical finally i know this isnt perfect not really fleshed out im pretty certain this wont actually happen someone with a six figure salary is in charge of that but it is scary to think that a driverless car will allow someone totally asleep to be driving along unable to react if the machine is compromised

30,is there a connection between the severity of the injury and how cognizant they are of previous functionality
31,probably not google phase sensitive detection and youll see how its actually quite easy to recover your own signal from a sea of noise
32,follow up question if there were a sea of self driving google cars that somehow had to report each others positions to each other actively rather than simply updating the positions of nearby cars inside their local memory how would that be done would that cause a problem with interference between all the signal updates
33,does anyone feel that self driving cars that talk to each other could be a bad thing i know it sounds like an ideal situation to eliminate traffic accidents and all that but i think and this is just me but can the cars be hacked information passing wirelessly between vehicles without human intervention leaves a lot of trust concerns should we start using self driving cars to transport our children to soccer practice it will happen trust me i dont think we are moving in the right direction on this idea
34,so this is actually one of the top reasons that we should move to driverless cars the problem with driverless cars isnt really the road and how to stay in the lane and how to make turns its more about how to predict cars with human drivers which can sometimes behave erratically for instance if you had driverless cars all communicating with eachother they would all know what the other cars are doing at any point in time this also means that since they share the same set of rules they can even predict how other cars will behave imagine its rush hour and suddenly a rock falls onto the road or something how does that react with human drivers the first person hits their brakes when they see the rock then person two hits their brakes when they see the brake lights then three when they see person twos brake lights you have several things slowing down this process driver reaction times mechanical slowness moving the foot to the brake for multiple drivers in a driverless car scenario the first car would spot the rock and signal to the cars behind them wirelessly that there is a blockage and they could all slam on their brakes at the same time without having to wait to see brakelights in more extreme cases the cars on either side of the first car could slam on their brakes to make room for the initial car to swerve and avoid the object something that would be impossible for a human to do on the other hand imagine a red light turning green car starts rolling then car starts rolling then car etc in a driverless world all the cars would start rolling at the same time in rush hour all the cars could be more tightly packed together because they dont need to leave as much room between cars to account for reaction times to get back to your question driverless cars communicating in eachother and working cooperatively has always been in the plan wireless communications work on a completely different frequency than lasers and other distancessonar type measurement tools wireless networks these days can already hand hundreds and thousands of users so you wouldnt have to worry about the car computers talking over eachother

37,well theres two ways to look at it looking at modern cell phone networks we see tons of devices encoding signals with either unique sim cards or cdma imei codes both of which represent widespread inter connectable wireless devices on the other end of the spectrum wireless internet is fairly limited on the frequencies it can use i think the first real hurdle would be in licencing airwaves for use in cars like this after enough bandwidth was obtained i doubt memory would be a problem but bandwidth and asynchronous operation would be an issue

40,well the fourier transform as used in digital signals encodingdecoding image encoding and analysis solving differential equations and so on is basically that its a big part of modern technology
41,whats to stop a malicious person to send false signals to everyone
42,very informative thanks second follow up question regarding computers talking to each other ive noticed that most of the wireless routers we employ for personal or business use are on a ghz or ghz on the protocols and these seem to suffer network dysfunction if too many devices are on the same network would a sea of driverless cars communicating with each other be more likely to use the or would the manufacturers of the communication system likely implement a separate protocol with a lot of bandwidth strictly for driverless communication

44,in a driverless car scenario the first car would spot the rock and signal to the cars behind them cars dont have to be driverless to support this in fact it would probably be a lot easier to switch to pervasive peer to peer communication of sensor data between cars than to driverless cars the points about reaction times and mechanical delays are better arguments for driverless cars
45,they share the same set of rules they can even predict how other cars will behave this is most important part right now our ability to coordinate with other drivers without being able to communicate is based on humans understanding and following traffic protocols i dont know exact numbers but i would suspect that upwards of of all traffic accidents are a result of humans failing to properly follow these protocols passing on the right going too fast following too closely etc at issue is that humans are greedy buggers who are only concerned with personal short term consequences so these protocols are often treated more like suggestions people generally dont care that rapidly changing lanes without signalling reduces the total throughput of the highway by x just that they are late to their dentist appointment imagine if airline pilots or train conductors thought the same way once we eliminate human drivers from the road entirely lots of these issues just go away a computer will never decide that it is ok to drive slowly in the left lane or roll through a stop sign it will follow the protocols put into place exactly as they were intended to be followed and traffic fatalities could drop into the hundred or dozens
46,i dont think that wireless communication between cars to synchronize them is a very good idea specifically because of the possibility of a rogue meatbag driven car there is also the problem of the protocol design say that cars are in lanes a b c d first cars are a b c d seconds are a d and so on how do you have cars relate to each other i mean how car c knows that hes behind c and besides b apparently the protocol would need to have a function that asks whos the car besidesin frontbehind me does car d really needs to know what b is doing the sheer number of cars going around all saying im going at such speed or i just passed the corner of hollywood and vine or hey i get a soft tyre would likely overwhelm the communication system no matter how terse the protocol is and would that protocol be guaranteed or every packet would be like a udp packet sent and forgotten in that case the wireless would not be vital for the safe operation so then in the kiss spirit why bother with wireless and only rely on environmental sensing lastly since google cars sense their environment by a laser scanning system it could be conceiveable that they could run at night without headlights and that the laser colour could also pierce through fog
47,whats the point of signalling the car behind that one is breaking it would help if they were human drivers but for driverless cars where reaction time is measured in nanoseconds by the time it receives the signal that the car in front is braking it could already know from seeing with its own robot eyes for your simple example i doubt the additional problems from all the networking would be worth the couple millisecond faster breaking time i dont think its worth the additional complexity when you can simply have every car behaving rationally as an individual

49,just as a follow up question how would we make the transition from independent cars to a network of cars wouldnt everyone driving in a particular area have to have one of these cars for it to work wouldnt this be practically impossible to implement
50,the first approach in every situation of what is there to stop a person from severely annoying or endangering others is laws that say you must not well make it illegal to send false signals between driverless cars in most areas of life this is completely sufficient of people see it as socially unacceptable to break laws are sufficiently put off by the danger of getting caught to attempt breaking laws and the rest are hopefully caught and punished after the fact numbers made up on the spot for example there is nothing stopping me from punching a random stranger in the face tomorrow but i dont want to i wont because its wrong and i dont want to go to jail there is nothing stopping me from driving drunk and crashing into oncoming traffic tomorrow except not wanting to and not wanting to go to jail computer scientists often forget about laws and social rules as a substitute for technology because on the internet its very difficult to enforce laws breaking into computers without permission is illegal but if the criminals are half a world away it does not work in practice if it is reasonably possible to catch the false signal senders after the fact just a law is sufficient protection and no complex technology is required
51,encryption is always an option they already have this kind of stuff for your remote for your car to unlock the door its encrypted in some way im not an expert in that but i do know there have been some security issues with thieves being able to transmit the signal to open your car and it opens no alarms no nothing to answer your question theres nothing stopping people from sending false signals but whether or not the car interprets them as real and reacts to them is a different story imagine a hacker were to be driving down the road and decide to recant the rock falling whats stopping him from saying theres a rock infront of me everyone behind me stop immediately they take that instruction as truth and act accordingly the car systems have to be built with security that isnt really feasible yet you have to protect the communications easy we do this all the time and the communications encryption method you also have to protect the hardware in from way from being tampered with in a way that could send false signals its very complicated and wont be an easy hurdle to overcome
52,nothing but you can always design algorithms that dont need to exclusively trust one person contrary to the answers here cryptography is not necessarily the answer it can be part of the answer crypto is designed to solve two problems integrity tampering and privacy eavesdropping it is not a tool to ensure that the originator is not lying to your or is unfriendly you can solve the problem with something akin to distributed consensus if out of cars ahead of you say that they are braking due to high traffic around the bend but tells you to speed up you can slow down on the assumption that a majority of the people your encounter are not dicks think of it as finding trackers and seeders to a torrent once in a while you encounter malicious operatives but most of the time things work out quite ok and the systems are designed to compensate for noise hijacking corruption people entering and exiting the network etc
53,this may always be an issue just as a sudden overpass collapse or a drunken driver going the wrong way are also possible there will be incidents where vehicles are involved in accidents however i think the point of developing a massive networked and semi autonomous systems is that in cases of accident a car accident will result instead of a car pile up whats more in such a circumstance traffic can be rerouted you dont have looky loo problems and emergency services will be alerted and arrive that much sooner its not about being foolproof but being vastly more efficient and safer than our human run system
54,i cant speak specifically to those wireless protocols but there are non protocols such as m aka wimax or g that have much larger ranges do not run into the issues with a large number of devices i think when youre seeing issues with a large number of clients on wifi that is a reflection on the hardware not on the protocol there are many enterprise grade wireless access points that can communicate with over a hundred clients at the same time that being said there would most likely be a standard that would allow for quick connections and disconnections as cars move in and out of range as well as a frequency that nothing else is transmitting on

56,now with wimax and g in mind which of the following would be more likely each vehicle is connected to the internet or even a separate dedicated network just for them via g wimax etc and communicates with master servers to giveget the vehicles location location of other vehicles status of street lights etc or each vehicle basically creates a really long range network and acts as its own server type infrastructure where it just shares info with only the vehicles in say a km radius regarding locations lights etc now in either case what about areas that would get no reception or signal from other drivers or a master communication system rural areas mountains etc

58,cars can talk to each other everyone in the area is on the same either government run or service provider run network range would be much less than you estimate
59,for case if you cant get any signal from other cars its probably because there are no other cars nearby which means you probably dont need to worry about colliding with them
60,to me it seems less about monitoring and more about complete centralized control of all trains decentralized automatic train safety systems have existed in one form or another for a long time im sure they already had plenty of monitoring because it would be ridiculously cheap to just superglue a smartphone running a nanny app onto every locomotive the thing that bothers me about it is if someone can use a computer to hit the brakes on a train that computer can also make the train go dangerously fast or ignore safety signals
61,we dont need cycle lanes everywhere bikes are allowed on roads well theyre not going to integrate into this automated car network very well edit spelling
62,ill get downvoted to shit but oh well i got a friend that does his masters degree on self driving tech and weve talked about it a fair bit short awnser not only will you be able to cross the road but youll be able to do so whenever you feel like it long awnser self driving cars wont just react to outside stimuli theyll be connected with each other through g connectivity updating their positions and statuses thousands of times per secondand they wont just connect with each other but with the road as well the big picture is that there will be a system that will either automatically or manually manages trafficand since there is such a system that manages all cars at once you can have normal intersectionsin intersectionsin front of the intersection you have a button you press it and the traffic manager simply stops all the cars you pass and when all the cars agree you have passed they start againas againas a pedestrian you dont have to wait for the light to turn greenyou greenyou just press the button and goself driving technology is extremely interesting and will reduce traffic timesand cars will require way less lanesi dont think its wise hating on it tho because you guys at the usa dont have trainsself driving cars and self driving tech isnt your problem your problem is that you dont have trains so allso focus on that xb sincerely a european
63,i dont understand why people dont think they can design a crosswalk that signals to cars to stop in fact you would probably be able to cross faster because you wouldnt have to wait for a light cycle to come around just to be able to cross
64,to be fair if we are talking about a future where technology has progressed this far it wouldnt be much of a reach that one could integrate a system where pedestrians can hit a button which would send a signal to all cars at the intersection to stop and allow them to pass not advocating for this just spitballing an idea
65,it doesnt even take a software bug one thing wrong with the road and it all grinds to a halt one patch of black ice that causes an unexpected brake one pothole the algorithm doesnt expect one emergency vehicle coming through the intersection that the algorithm doesnt know how to schedule around one deer darting out into the road one piece of debris one tire bursting etc etc etc theres so many spanners that could get thrown into those works and all it takes is one for the entire thing to turn into a massive pileup if we were going to automate everything into a giant public transit system there are way more efficient and safe solutions than one car per commuter a comprehensive rail network with an automated last mile system for instance you ride the train to the station nearest your destination then you get on a self driving short range rickshaw kind of thing for the last mile connection provided you dont just walk there were so obsessed with future that were creating problems that we dont need to solve all so we can pretend the needlessly complicated solution is the better one because future

67,the button on the cross walk could send a signal to stop traffic
68,you know what would make this better putting the cars in a guideway so they dont have to deal with tracking their curves and driving themselves now the cars are only having to deal with one axis forward and back to further optimize the design lets separate the crossing streams of traffic so they dont have to stop for each other to reduce waiting time then lets reduce the rolling resistance by putting the cars on steel wheels and on steel rails since they no longer have to quickly stop at the intersection to wait for other cars to further improve the design lets make the cars connect together based on the destinations of people to reduce wind resistance we could even afford to take all the small inefficient engines and put them in the front car as a more efficient larger engine or maybe even create some incredibly futuristic way of powering the cars from a wire above the guideway since this would be a more efficient means of transferring energy i call it the transportation by roadway for an incredibly national network or trainn for short
69,a pedestrian crosses exactly the same way he does today push the walk button except that its better because the cars will actually obey the crossing signal even when the driver is watching tiktok and you can tap your phone to request a cross walk anywhere regardless of stoplights being installed
70,automatic street crosser like a booth you step into its connected to the same network the cars are on so you just press a go button when you enter then it will read the situation just as the rest of the cars do and will take you to the other side
71,everytime i see the self driving simulation model bs i just think of the first level in dead space where you fuck up one single autonomous transport and it criplles the entire network thats just a video game too someone could easily fuck up the system here as well
72,i still believe self driving cars have the potential to be far safer than human drivers and this is a pretty dumb meme right we can still install crosswalks for pedestrians that link up to the self driving car network
73,well first of all it wont need x lanes for that many cars it could probably use one left one straight one right in each direction and a receiving lane for each approach for x lanes half as many then you as a pedestrian would get a button to signal that youd like to cross the approaching cars would be notified the lights would change the cars would stop you would cross the lights would change the cars would resume within a minute or two it would be back to normal
74,how about detecting the presence of a pedestrian and signalling the cars to stop via radio i agree thats not perfect but even systems like this may have a time and a place
75,since we have no clue how cognition ie the abilty to think and reason works in a biological brain we have no ability to create machines that have that ability either deep learning algorithms and neural network software do not and cannot have this ability regardless of how much training data you throw at it a child knows the difference between a real stop sign and a stop sign on someones clothing they also know that a stop sign is still a stop sign even if it has a sticker or some graffitti on it these so called improperly named ais do not know the difference furthermore any so called self driving car that has to randomly pull over to the side of the road and stop then call a remote human operator to guide it manually through whatever it is it cant handle is not in any way shape or form ready to be responsible for the safety of human occupants or be allowed on public roads its all a failed technology that will never be ready for real world use these companies all know this but have invested so much money in the development that they insist on marketing it anyway to recover that money or go bankrupt dont fall for the self driving car meme
76,im aware that there are flaws that make something like a bridge or underpass not a viable option for pedestrians but wouldnt another solution to just have crosswalks with signals exactly like the ones we currently use like it would work just like in the simulation above but at the intersection there would be crosswalks and a button that pedestrians can push when they want to cross that button would signal to the mainframe to bring all cars crossing that crosswalk to a stop and signal for pedestrians to cross for an appropriate amount of time after which traffic would resume as normal this would actually be an improvement over the current system because it would mean that only the cars specifically traveling through the crosswalk would be affected and all other traffic can proceed at full capacity
77,press the button like normal but instead its sending a signal to all incoming ai cars to stop
78,they would stop for the signal in theory
79,either a signal button that you push to halt traffic for when a pedestrian needs to cross a set interval when traffic is periodically stopped for pedestrians or bridges there thats solutions with minimal brain power being put forth oh a self driving shuttle that you get into activate and it works it way across in the same fashion as the other self driving cars are integrating with each other that is solutions
80,theres no reason to make up new driving rules for automated traffic flow that would make things difficult for times where manual driving is needed or for pedestrians synchronizing traffic lights utilizing alternate routes proportionally and avoiding hazards and construction would erase the majority of traffic and congestion while also decreasing travel speed which also results in better safety for cyclists and pedestrians cars would be networked at that point along with traffic signals and things like debris on the road downed power lines potholes etc would all be able to be reported in real time to the proper departments so wed see a decrease in say power outage durations during storms automatic ride sharing options would also decrease the amount of vehicles on the roads which in turn benefits all of the above the lives saved alone will be worth it the reduction of accidents will be astronomical and ticketting police would be virtually eliminated on the roads theyd need to find new ways to generate revenue

82,one computer network error from disaster
83,although i think this driverless driving is not a good idea i dont think this would be a big problem if some error occurs a car could send out a distress signal which causes other cars to stop so that the problem can either be removed or circumnavigated
84,i think both sides suffer from a strong case of car brain with automatic traffic you wouldnt get rid of pedestrian crossings instead it would be like creating a pedestrian crossing everywhere along the road you just have to make some kind signal like raising your arm or pressing a button on your phone and then walk across the street anywhere you cant deny that self driving cars are vastly superior to conventional ones even when there might be some even better solutions like trains
85,a software program cannot or doesnt weigh in human life in their decision there should be a difference in reaction whether a ball or child jumps in front when there is not a safe stopping distance ultimately its going to be the drivers decision at least in days pass this is why ai fighter copilots would not release munitions ultimately its a human decision to release munitions i believe today its still true a human initiates the wireless drones to release munitions
86,tesla traffic light free roads to be rolled out nationwide in months years later tesla traffic light free road debuts in las vegas on a mile stretch of road with intersections however design now features the patented tesla speedlighttrade that send a automated ai controlled spectrum devided optical signals to cars when it is safe to cross the intersection
87,pedestrian scramble enmwikipediaorgwikipedestrian_scramble a pedestrian scramble also known as scramble intersection and scramble corner canada x crossing uk diagonal crossing us scramble crossing スクランブル交差点 sukuranburu kōsaten japan exclusive pedestrian interval or barnes dance is a type of traffic signal movement that temporarily stops all vehicular traffic thereby allowing pedestrians to cross an intersection in every direction including diagonally at the same time it was first used in canada and the united states in the late s but it later fell out of favor with traffic engineers there as it was seen as prioritizing flow of pedestrians over flow of car traffic faq opt out redditcommessagecompose towikisummarizerbotmessageoptoutsubjectoptout opt out of subreddit npredditcomrfuckcarsaboutbanned github githubcomsujal wikisummarizerbot downvote to remove v
88,vegas is the perfect place to be pedestrianized with a robust transit network tons of pedestrians are out and most of them are tourists who flew in and thus dont have a car
89,they wouldnt be using cameras it would be networked trivial to solve
90,it does sound insane but thats exactly what theyll be able to do the commenter above is right well probably need some sort of localized cloud comms between self driving vehicles to be able to send messages to other cars around them which signal the car behind them and so on this will all happen in the blink of an eye if we get the centralized system right average human response time of ms vs maybe ms of the vehicles with the added benefit of knowing the obstacle algorithm isnt going to panic and slam on its breaks or swerve violently or we could use trains
91,highly doubt that a series of signal bulbs has anywhere near the same investment and upkeep required as dedicated pedestrian sky bridges and tunnels which is to say you need to do more than just redirect your traffic light money
92,too many of them do use daytime running lights turn signals and hazard lights these things blind me and can give me motion sickness and migraines i doubt im the only one affected
93,got yelled at by a driver for passing him on the right in slow traffic then cutting over to a left turn lane then the driver who yelled at me made an unsignaled right on red without coming to a complete stop right after telling me i need to follow all the rules if i wanted to be on the road
94,i will often go out of my way to ride down main st on my bike taking the lane slowing down people who want to do kmh in what should be a kmh zone people who do dangerous shit in the streets of my city deserve to be purposefully slowed down excessive slowness sounds like a dream compared to the hellscape that is our road network currently
95,aww is comprehension hard for somebody see the people on the right on their computers those are the people im making a point about day in and day out people in their cars and trucks witness other car and truck drivers do stupid shit and they just go on about life as usual but those same car and truck drivers will see one person on a bicycle roll through a stop sign or litter or weave in and out of traffic or do some other thing and take to social media bitching about all bicyclists the point is that both groups are guilty of bad behavior but we dont seem to automatically assume all drivers to be terrible because we witness one guy forget to use a blinker but witness one guy on a bicycle forget to use a hand signal and boomer bob is on facebook bitching about how bicycles shouldnt be allowed on the road
96,developing the transportation networks well need and abolishing zoning laws will take time that should be the first priority but switching to evs in the meantime seems like the best option until then
97,electric vehicle are not meant to replace everything design a good transit network and then convert cars to electric for the last bit of ecology though is it really ecological to dig lithium
98,i agree evs are a middle step as reconfiguring the entire transportation network in one fell swoop is welll not happening
99,its actually more of a function of speed you can look at the famous vision zero charts visionzeronetworkorgwp contentuploadsspeed limits picjpg speed matters more because kinetic energy scales with the square of speed while mass is just a linear increase
100,eh want to get really in the weeds of it it is ai ai can even just be if statements ai is an incredibly general term that includes basically any computer decision making ml is a subset of ai and not all self driving algos are neural networks source masters in comp sci and a lot of talk with aiml folk
101,you consider this ai enwikipediaorgwikicommunications based_train_control any programmed command control system is ai then traffic lights are ai what city or suburb doesnt have computer controlled traffic signals at this point is that ai and thanks for the condescension i may not work in it but i have plenty of friends who do aiml including one mit phd who has worked for llnl doing it who i have also had a lot of talk with what ai based autonomous vehicle system under development doesnt use machine learning machine vision etc
102,wish i knew about this subreddit sooner i subscribed to notjustbikes recently but ive always hated cars i have anxiety and i hate having to cross the fucking street it is nerve wracking every single time i have to cross a literal highway to get to the grocery store and it doesnt even have any fucking crossing signals cars are ruining the planet and making everybody miserable america is nothing but highways and parking lots seeing pictures of cities in other countries makes me so sad and jealous and angry at what the automotive industry turned my country into fuck cars
103,i like cars but it would be nice if the government would work on building a more efficient train network that helps people get around the country better and takes the current network out of private hands the ticket prices are unnecessarily extortionate due to industry corruption and the tracks and trains are maintained poorly and with not much high speed link development it would just be nice not to have to drive to get everywhere i need to go people could spend that time productively or read a book or watch a film instead
104,many signalised junctions in the us shouldnt have traffic lights at all they should be roundabouts within towns synchronizing lights to a speed that only cars can achieve will make car dependency worse because it means that driving a car is convenient and easy but if youre on a bike youll get stopped at every red light synchronizing them to bike speed i think some copenhagen arterials have done this can be a good idea though
105,this is a totaly valid point not every village can have a adequate public transport connection just as you need cars to move large items on rare routes like moveing most pepole in here dont want to completly ban all cars we are just advocating for more investments in public transport and an end of subsidies for car ownership
106,increase transit connections to suburbs and encourage infill and people friendly development in previously restrictive zip codes next question
107,if you had your way would you eminent domain all suburbs and force them into apartment complexes with bus or train access weird strawman suburbs that are walkable with good cycling infrastructure and transit connections already exist but not a lot because modern zoning laws make them impossible to build in north america anymore
108,aight here we go it isnt the existence of cars that is responsible for climate change it isnt the existence of cars that is responsible for climate change people cheap out and buy old cars or big trucks and never ever think about fuel efficiency and people often drive to the same location in multiple cars decreasing efficiency cars arent dangerous humans are laws just dont allow autopilot systems therefor they arent developed almost all crashes are caused by human error this is full on right nothing to debate here lol this is made worse tho because of course you need the biggest truck with the biggest engine because your pp grows or whatever cars arent even that expensive its only that you are all poor apparently see the nordics cars cost like times as much there if you dont live in a big city you can not use public transport whats the alternative this is the result of poor planning oh wait see you use a car to go to multiple places there cant be less parking places than cars there must be more if you want to park your car there must be that many parking spaces as sais public transport wont and cant work for other than densely populated areas if you only have passengers per trip the perfect place to fit those and go to a specific location is a automobile what if i continue because this whole debate is idiotic i agree somewhat with you the problem i have is that most of the whole subreddit faces everything from the perspective of the united states of murica and even all most of the sources and suggested videos in the main post are about the f cking us you dont seem to get that this is the world wide web not the freedom network prove me wrong i dare you i want you rip karma
109,highways also isolate neighborhoods my city very recently started to tear out an extremely unnecessary bypass built in and replacing a vibrant african american neighborhood in the downtown area within walking distance of the largest concentration of employment in the city that essentially just mirrored the interstate but a mile west on the other side of the downtown commercial district ostensibly the bypass was supposed to connect downtown with suburban areas to the south that already had reasonable interstate access but it was never completed making it even more redundant and useless than it was planned to be due to poor record keeping from the planners of the time we dont know exactly what the true aim of the project was but theories abound that the city wanted affluent suburbanites to be able to bypass black communities en route to the city center or that the city wanted to erase a well maintained and tight knit community of black residents so close to what was to be a grand spectacle of a downtown area regardless of motivation that bypass cut off the neighborhoods to the west of the city from downtown plummeting property values of the homes that werent destroyed from an era adjusted k to a modern k city median being k and turning the area into a food desert as most black businesses were in the area that was paved over by the construction project movement of families and loss of property taxes meant that public facilities were less maintained with fewer incentives and finances to maintain them the closing of schools and overgrowth of parks perpetuated the vicious cycle and accelerated the downward spiral even with a recent beautification project in the area including the commissioning of new affordable housing units to replace abandoned and blighted properties its still not exactly an area you want to be in the wonderful municipal zoo and the citys only krispy kreme location cant be fully enjoyed because the area is full of desperation and neglect and its all thanks to cars or at least cars were the easiest excuse to destroy a large swath of the city either instantly through demolition and construction or through a long and painful starvation that is still ongoing today part of the deconstruction project that started a few years ago will include the reconnection of those isolated neighborhoods to the city center the community that was removed can never be replaced but i hold out hope that the section of the city that was destroyed can regrow and become something special again besides remaking vital connections the rest of the replacement process is still up in the air but the prevailing plan seems to be some sort of public space whether a man made forest or an enormous park whatever it is itll be a much better use of acres than the redundant unused highway that strangulated half of the city
110,thats the thing these are classified as an ebike not a vehicle because they dont go faster than mph so they only qualify for the ebike credit but you dont need to pay insurance on them so its got its pros and cons its also got turn signals and brake lights that alone is great
111,my only fear is the brakes on ebikes arent up to par with motorcycles mph pushes the little brakes to the limit i think these ebikes should be viewed as the early versions but not the final iteration i think they need the right kind of electric turn signals and better brakes but still keep the weight under lbs
112,a well designed network could avoid that have an express bus that stops at a h q and z then have the local buses stop at a h h q and q z set the schedule to time the transfers and youve got a bus network thats quicker for almost everyone
113,and building a good network is exceptionally easy when you allow housing to be built densely as it means a lot of people will want to go to the same place
114,dont know how it is in other countries but thats what the different train types are for in german speaking countries you have regional trains travelling locally that is with a stop at every station even in tiny rural towns i think thats how passenger rail got its start in the first place so some of those regional rail routes are really old like th century old and have earned themselves nicknames that are sometimes printed on the trains livery you use those regional trains if you want to get to or from a small town but theyre pretty slow for longer routes unfortunately if the railway company shuts down unprofitable routes its usually some of these that get the axe then you have regional express rail with the only difference being that they skip most stations so if you want to get from one city to a nearby city or from a smaller place to a city that isnt too far away you use these because they dont have to crawl theyre not exactly high speed either but taking them has the advantage of not needing parking or finding your way into or out of a dense urban area in a car above those you have intercity trains meant to connect urban areas that arent part of the same region they travel faster and skip more stations theyre more expensive and offer several price classes a food wagon etc some important city pairs also have high speed rail connections intercity express theres also commuter rail s bahn connecting cities and their suburbs at generally higher frequencies than regular regional rail out of the three german speaking countries its probably switzerland that does it best rail transport in germany isnt always that great
115,self driving cars almost as good as having a functional affordable railroad network
116,how about an extensive network of bullet sleeper trains instead faster safer feasible now no congestion just saying
117,itt people basically longing for most of the qualities of travel by modern train networks building out modern train infrastructure in the united states would be a lot better for the environment communities of all socio economic level workers and pedestrians
118,technology is still a long way off i was talking to a friend about this and he says its a race between two technologies cameras and lidar cameras are outside in which means they scan the environment and act accordingly the benefit of this is that camera technology has had a head start so design wise theyre low profile but theyre extremely inaccurate lidar is inside out which means they send out light signals and scan the environment based on how the light is reflected the benefit of this is that theyre extremely accurate but design wise theres a big ol spinning doo hickey on top of the car its going to come down to whether cameras can become more accurate or if lidar can minimize its visual footprint at least this is what my friends in tech predict im a layman so i take everything they say as gospel
119,i work in the airlines industry and constant tell people if your destination is less than an hour drive just do that after the hassle of security connections and other stuff you end up getting there at close to the same time sometimes
120,maybe somewhat skeptical though this will only disrupt for flights of miles or less more than that and a self driving car offers over flying quickly starts to disappear further this will only impact passengers who are specifically going between those points often if you dont live in a place with a hub you might have to be taking that mile flight to get to a hub to fly to your final destination for those passengers flying would still be better in almost all cases than using a driverless car setting all that aside you have cost a mile flight costs obviously some variables involved there that could increase or decrease that number the overall homehotel to homehotel travel time would be about half as well about for flight to about for car so the self driving cars would cost a person hours of travel time on top of their own intrinsic cost an autonomous self driving vehicle driving miles unless you start putting a decent number of passengers in there as well which means fewer andor pricier amenities that ticket is going to be expensive as well all that said there are definitely a number of people who would find this service for beneficial certainly this would probably be a lot less stressful andor scary for people who have a fear of flying the self driving car could pick you up near your home and drop you off near your location so you dont have to worry about connections or things like that for people who live far from an airport and particularly going to a place far from an airport this would also be a very attractive option there is obviously a market there for self driving cars for such types of travel but i dont think its as significant as the article would imply driverless cars are going to have a much much more profound impact on intra metro travel than inter metro travel
121,or allow driver less car to board high speed rail hyper loop the beluga air liner in a comprehensive travel network monitored and controlled through rfid passport scanners its not going to kill air liners they have to adapt their business model
122,i could work full time in my car during the trips would be amazing with no airport preparedness lack of solid data and voice connection imagine working the whole drive up until your vacation destination http harrisontravelscoukwp contentuploadsarticle eebdc _xjpg
123,especially once driverless cars are widespread and they can be networked together at that point they could go at a much faster speed and still be safer than it is with people driving
124,seeing people get excited about disrupting the airline industry makes me wish that we did some basic maintenanceupgrades on our train infrastructure years ago imagine if we converted our aging network of slow and decrepit trains into sleek reliable fast trains
125,its not just the airline industry that is poised for disruption motels along interstates make their business off of cross country travelers why stop at a motel if you can just recline the seat and sleep while the car keeps driving how about the housing markets right now commute zones define where housing is most desireablenobody wants to commute minutes to work but if you could sleep during those minutesor pull up your wireless laptop and start the work day who cares how long the commute is airlines is a very easy one to see the issues get in your car friday after work and youre halfway across the north american continent by am the next morning
126,phoenix and san diego are a and a half hour drive apart phoenix and los angeles are about hours away by car la and san diego are anywhere from hours from each other by car traffic las vegas is hours from both phoenix and los angeles san jose is about hours from los angeles albuquerque is about hours from phoenix while el paso is only hours away albuquerque and el paso are only hours apart albuquerque is also hours from denver but what about other areas of the country boston and washington are only hours apart there are cities providence new york philadelphia wilmington and baltimore on that route its only another hours to richmond and another hours to norfolk and virginia beach from either location its hours to raleigh thats pretty close to all the large north carolina cities and only hours from atlanta atlanta and jacksonville are a measly hours and orlando is another hours away all of florida is easily accessible that way on a road trip from san francisco to boston you could drive and hit a city within hours of leaving the last one every time san francisco takes you to san jose then los angeles phoenix tucson el paso san antonio houston new orleans mobile birmingham atlanta charlotte raleigh richmond washington baltimore wilmington philadelphia new york and finally boston a similar route diverging between washington and philadelphia could take you to chicago with the same constraint if the us ever gets an electric passenger rail network or a large hyperloop network city pairs like these would be huge opportunities this could be a major problem for any airline they have to figure out how to arrange the network of flights but with demand shrinking even further as the distance between cities also shrinks
127,i think thats the wheelhouse its going to really fuck with the regional flights and short length connections
128,also you have more control over the trip can take as many rest breaks as you want hell make changes on the fly moreover with good cellular network reception or an account with starlink you can even work and play while the car is driving itself i can see a business in renting self driving large doubledeckers that can serve multiple passengers with shower rooms and shared kitchen
129,for the long haul drives current batteries dont have the range perhaps they could build some sort of wireless charging lane
130,all depends on where you are going and how many flights you have to catch when you start having to make connections and the total travel time starts getting closer or passes drive time
131,start talking high speed trains and it would be only moderately more appealing than amtrak unfortunately a network of high speed rail seems further off than self driving long haul cars in the us
132,the american identity was built on the car and highways though our cities states and entire country isnt organized in a manner thats friendly to the kind of european network that was built up over decades granted it will have to be modem american towns and cities are so organically grown that only those in the rust belt and midwest have any semblance of organization due to their grid networks but even then those were designed with outdated ideals walking minutes in a densely populated area to a hypothetical convenient and efficiently placed stop would be only possible in a handful of american cities at the moment it sucks and it would take massive forethought vision and leadership and funds to make that kind of real change happen in this country
133,that makes trains really expensive to purchase yes but what really ruined passenger trains was the widespread removal of double tracking across the country it would be impossible to run the speed and frequency of zephyr services of yrs ago on a now pretty much only freight optimised network
134,you can work full time in the car imagine vehicles where the back seat is setup like an office with a g g connection
135,some type of wireless charging pad like we have for phones car ai does its magic and detects when it needs to pull into a bay plops onto a pad and you just keep sleeping
136,eventually the cars will form their own network that utilizes particular roadways just for temporary relocation while waiting on user and other roadways for actual transportation throughout the area
137,if they can get the actual operating cost low enough it could conceivably become cheaper per mile to use a ride hailing service rather than owning your own car fuelpower would be equal of course and a vanishingly small expense on electrichybrid vehicles but depreciation would be split among all the fares as would maintenance costs and battery replacements and other expenses which a car owner must shoulder themselves now imagine that the service you get rides from is a nationwide network you can hail an autocab get in sleep for hours wake up halfway across the country and then leave the car for someone else to use like you would do with a rental car or a uhaul and this doesnt just have to be in big cities taxis and ridesharing services usually only work in big cities because you have to pay the driver enough to make a living so you have to have enough traffic to keep him busy but if its all automated with the costs being mainly depreciation maintenance and fuelpower then suddenly it makes sense to provide service in areas with only moderate demand a car that only gets used for hours a day to take people to and from work and the grocery store in a town of k people might still turn a profit and be cheaper than individual car ownership for the end user all this adds up to a future where private vehicle ownership is for the wealthy the rural and enthusiasts
138,as an it guy working for the us air force im very concerned about how accessible the computer technology in self driving cars will be one bad update can completely wreck a network i am seriously concerned that self driving cars will present terrorists who can hack with a highly accessible weapon of mass destruction if im ignorant of how these cars are being programmed to prevent intrusion please inform me until i can see proof that im wrong i will continue to believe there is no such thing as safe software
139,sounds great but does the average consumer want to give trust to a machine or do it themselves obviously crashes are gonna be higher with humans driving overall but that averages every idiot who cant even use a turn signal this will catch on eventually but i dont know if people are ready for that transition just yet
140,im not in the business of self driving cars dont know much about it at all but i have worked with robotics and id be inclined to say that a lot of litigation will come about if companies decide not to pay out to the best known algorithms written which are known to be more robust in robotics you have tolerances of the machines the higher the tolerance the higher the cost sometimes double the cost sometimes a customer doesnt want to pay that much for the machine so you have to try to solve the problem via algorithm ive written algorithms that have to contend with a lot of noise to signal ratio extra latency bigger epsilons or slop so that the algorithm didnt trip over shitty input in short more can go wrong the cheaper you try to build something tldr there will be a lot of people blaming cheaply made self driving cars for wrongful deaths
141,im inclined to agree the ai ive seen so far has been very limited in its ability to handle new situations the self driving cars have better senses and quicker reaction time they dont fall asleep or get drunk but as far as i know they cant figure anything out that is new to them they wont be suspicious of anything unusual that could be a potential problem i know how to predict that its likely a child will run into the street even if i dont see any kids i can drive like a bat out of hell if im escaping from a wildfire or a flood or god knows what i will intentionally run into a pole to avoid hitting a pedestrian and besides i think it will be common for self driving vehicles to get hung up and not be able to move busy intersections heavy city traffici already had a situation where a self driving car insisted on giving up the right of way at a four way stop imagine four self driving cars each waiting for the other sure maybe there would be manual override but i would expect at least one snafu in a city once a day they cant improvise and they cant figure out when to bend the rules and we have a ton of pedestrian traffic in my town when it becomes obvious the vehicle cant run us over we might just walk in the street why not there arent enough cops to arrest us all for jaywalking btw i wonder if self driving cars are going to be able to handle police hand signals rodney brooks autonomous cars and police when the traffic lights are out i know everyone loves this idea but it isnt like playing chess i guess well know the answer soon enough one way or the other
142,seems like cornucopian nonsense i dont know how you put a vehicle on the road where the driver cant obey hand signals from a police officer
143,you could say the same thing about virtually anything with cars though seatbelts some people might get injured from seatbelts they othereise would not have turn signals might cause a few accidents that otherwise would not have self driving cars are worth it as soon as the save number gets bigger than the accidently killed number its a bit different from the trolley problem regardless though since part of it is thst flipping the switch causes you as an individual to kill people deontological based rule breaking for murder rather than utilitarianism for maximum lives saved
144,literally am a network architect with access to the highest end stuff i have a job because computers dont work all the time i have a brand new mac laptop and a month old ryzen x desktop running windows
145,eventually when traffic deaths plummit and all cars start driving themselves for a while we will look at traffic deaths like elevator deaths now its not a signal that we should not automate it its just a now more unusual accident we all accept that right now you could nothing wrong and still get tboned by some idiot thats somehow fine but the tiniest risk of self driving car killing us is weird
146,there is little reason cars should not be in communication with each other like an ad hoc mesh atc network we just need to reach critical mass of ai driven cars the cars who are linked can share data about pedestrians road hazards and non controlled vehicles on the road the software to accomplish that is straightforward but nontrivial to implement even standard driver controlled vehicles could contribute camera data and benefit from a digital model of the road ahead for example to see hazards over the hill or around the curve ahead through a hud system
147,i mean the same could be asked of drivers though are you one those who sees a yellow light as speed up turn signals are optional
148,ive been hit as a pedestrian times once while still on the footpath the other two times was at an intersection with lights as i crossed with the pedestrian indicator i agree that as a pedestrian its important that you still look both ways crossings and traffic lights with pedestrians signals arent cross whenever theyre you have right of way cross when safe i have seen pedestrians step out on zebra crossings knowing cars have to stop but they dont physically give nearby cars enough time to stop that said i have a visual impairment and while i did look before i crossed i unfortunately missed the car that was barrelling up the parking lane because my brain doesnt really see movement well and i assumed when i saw a car in the parking lane it was well parked he was speeding and in the wrong lane but i did step in front of him without enough time for him to stop i believe that if i wasnt visually impaired i would have avoided that accident so thats kinda on me but also completely the drivers fault for driving in the wrong lane and planning to run the red light the other intersection was completely the drivers fault i was halfway across the road when the driver looked up from his phone saw a green light and just started driving off the green light was for trams not cars pedestrians cyclists and trams had a green signal cars and buses still had red the other time i was walking down the footpath on a small inner city commercial street and a car that was stuck in jammed traffic just randomly pulled to the left to try and get into the parking lane to cut traffic off but he was overzealous and mounted the curb straight into me thankfully the curb took most of the momentum out of the car so i was just knocked over thankfully the only injuries have been bruising and joint dislocations which im prone to anyway the annoying thing is the complete lack of self awareness so many drivers seem to have at their incompetence i can actually legally drive if i want despite my neurological issues with vision i can pass motor department eye exams because they dont test depth perception or movement tracking just can you read text from a few metres away however im not stupid i dont want to become a murderer or a corpse so i dont drive i recognise that just because i legally can doesnt mean i have the skills and ability to do so
149,yeah the future of self driving car includes keeping signal lights and have said cars read them its totally not a temporary solution due to the fact that there are still human drivers around jeez
150,the problem is theres no such thing as identical scenarios so you cant just say if this then that the whole concept behind neural networks is that they are fluid and adapt to the current situation which is always unique in pretty much any regard
151,im not an expert but if the crosswalk is painted then the vehicle would slow down to the speed it would need to react to something that may run across they have like different kinds of sensors and then dozens of them to see things chances are most communities would sooner or later put signals on all sidewalk crossings for cars to easily see or clear the view so bikers and joggers could be seen
152,except in the world of north america where we have combined brake lightsindicators when one light burns out you lose your brake light tail light and turn signal
153,my background is in developing algorithms for data analysis banking and investments but my programming skills amount to a well trained script kiddie at best so im finding it quite difficult simply from a programming perspective i understand the concepts at a much higher level than my educators but stumble hard on implementation i think most programs ive looked into teach the concepts well but infosec is a lot more commoditized than machine learning so if you dont plan to rise to the top youll have more demand and opportunity in infosec with a basic level of understanding everyone needs a secure database but few people need a simple neural network would you happen to have any recommendations for learning to program more as a subconscious reflex im very goal oriented so doing more exercises for the sake of exercises kills me inside python
154,and charges wirelessly
155,i just want to be able to leave the house by myself being disabled and unable to drive sucks big time so ill take the emails also just say you had bad signal on the way lol
156,dont forget that since youll be able to do other stuff while the car is driving and most of all when other vehicles are all networked together you can also live farther away from work and still make it there in minutes if everyones car is able to go mph because they all know where each other car is travel time will be greatly reduced
157,i imagine itll cut down on traffic jams less stop and go and more go slower and keep moving especially if they joined a network
158,didnt vladimir lenin say industrialization was going to lead to a post labor society and socialismcommunism was the only way forward that didnt involve mass poverty and then soviet communism caused mass poverty while the west grew fat off the fruits of industrialization and experienced full employment for decades to come its easy to predict which jobs will be lost to automation however trying to predict what ones will be created is like someone in the s predicting that people will be employed in offices operating computers or developing computer networks in the future new technology has been removing jobs and creating others since the dawn of civilization technology replaces people in the short term but in the long term it is always merely a tool assist to humans to reach new heights i dont see that paradigm changing unless true artificial general intelligence becomes more than just theory tldr the idea that a post labor society is looming in the near future and communism is required to deal with it is a lie as old as communism itself
159,while i am most definitely an organ donor i do not think we should be relying on mvc for our organ donations we need better education to encourage people to sign up as well as a complete overhaul of the way we keep medical records while working in an er that shall remain nameless i noticed the organ donor network only took tissue from the eyes out of times there is just no way for the network to know the quality of ones past to discern if the person has organs worth of transplant
160,every time someone posts this nonsense in this sub i have to assume they live in a big city where everything they need is within walking distance and they are so caught up in their own little world they have an inability to see the big picture nono its uber and lyft who will own a fleet of them and you will get rides in them for pennies on the dollar compared to todays prices first your assessment that it will be pennies on the dollar is so ridiculous its not even worth arguing but i am going to do it anyway its going to be more expensive not less the most obvious when was the last time a company lowered their pricing models because they got rid of the human element in fact how about any company lowering their established pricing models on anything in any industry for any reason you said pennies on the dollar that means that it is at the very least less than a standard rate so what you are saying is that a taxi ride thats what it is will now cost instead of even the most economically naive person could not possibly claim this with a straight face not as obvious from what i have read uber takes of the cut of each fare this mean they get for nothing more than hosting the app and creating the connection they do not own the car they do not pay for the fuel insurance or car payment so basically what you are saying is not only will uber charge less for the ride but they will also buy all the new automated cars pay all the fees cover all the maintenance insurance the responsibility and then lower the fee significantly right now as it stands with their cut uber etc are losing money a lot of money uber lost over two billion in so please explain to me how its going to be pennies on the dollar after they start picking up all the expenses that go with it at that point why would you want to own a car uber and lyft and all the other app services have existed since the automobile was invented they are called taxis there is literally no difference between a taxi and uber except one is legally licensed and regulated to do the work and is indemnified by an actual company the same reason not everyone rides in taxis is why people will still own cars whether they are automated or not this notion that everyone will have no issue calling up an automated car and waiting for it to arrive every time you want to leave your house work or the store is complete fantasy it works in a big city it doesnt work anywhere else i am in a suburb if i call a cab it will take at the very least minutes to get here this doesnt consider the fact that of the population goes to work at the same time they leave work at the same time they go to the grocery store the movies etc all in the same peak periods this means that there has to be an over abundance of vehicles or you have to ride share which would further hinder any time related needs and isnt in any way attractive to the average consumer a minute normal ride to a store to pick up some munchies turns into a minute thing with taxi rides this doesnt even touch the subject of where all these cars are going to be stored charged and maintained if everyone calls uber uber is going to need dozens of millions of cars if not hundreds of millions right now virtually every vehicle is in a garage a driveway imagine if uber needed thousand cars for just a small city in new york state where are they going to be stored how long will it take them to get to their call one last thing to keep in mind in terms of why every thing you do everywhere you go will be recorded good luck with that automated cars are frikin awesome cant wait to own one but they will not usher in a new age of non car ownership and taxi rides and they will not be cheaper there are literally other things i could list that blow everyones fantasy out of the water and you know them you just wont admit them
161,im most interested in how long it will take to bring autonomous cars up to the standards of say a german driver were shooting pretty low in this country if we just want the cars to kill a few less people than somebody who was haphazardly trained by a parent who only remembers half the rules thinks signaling is optional and doesnt know what to do when they see a stopped school bus and still has a license
162,it would be nice if there could be autonomous only roads i imagine a lot of the risk is from detection errors having a standard signaling protocol for cars to pull exact data about their positioning and entities surrounding them would be a huge advantage makes the ai driver extremely simple
163,why does everyone just assume things are secure and wont ever be used maliciously we cant even keep hotel door locks from being hacked or a a simple database with peoples information secure but we want a complicated software system in charge of a vehicle this is a vicious cycle every time something new comes out medical tech wifi whatever corporations fail to think about security first they designed wireless insulin pumps and pacemakers with few if any security protocols in place lets put million cars on the road with that same philosophy good idea
164,i think the issue here is that we are seeking or expecting perfection within the logic of self driving cars as a software architect i do believe that the expectation is incorrect and unrealistic the realistic expectation here is that at least version of the cars should be more safer than the current averages which i do believe that currently autonomous self driving cars are way ahead of the current averages moving forward i think distributed network over cars in which all cars are aware and can communicate with other cars to share data and details about visibility speed alerts etc would be a great benefit and will increase the accuracy of the module even better in the meantime i think self driving cars should be tested and rolled out as they are the testing data that was provided by the car owners is not enough the public needs to start testing and using these cars in every day practice this is the only way we can stabilize and improve this product the public testing of these autonomous cars is the realistic test the technology will improve x the rate when we start a beta testing with retail according to the realistic expectations set i think self driving cars will be a great success cant wait
165,yeah were like years away from seeing the full benefit of driverless cars itll be ten years before they really become somewhat common and another just to get them saturated into the market and have people who grew up driving their own cars age out of the system side point it probably wont be common but hack attacks on cars might become a problem most likely with stealing cars cops will probably have the ability to force your car to pull over which is great if all cops are just and make the best decisions and you dont mind having no autonomy in your own vehicle also any serious analysis of self driving cars will beg the question why public transportation isnt more efficient and readily available in the cities making hundreds of millions of cars network and drive intelligently is probably a bigger pain in the ass than just having good public mass transit systems
166,at least self driving technology would improve and learn from the thousands of mistakes made around the network until it decides fuck it kill them all
167,i think the real problem with avs is going to be when one does kill someone and someone now needs to determine was the av or the deceased persons more at fault if it is decided that it was the av who is responsible the owner of the vehicle or the company or companies behind the avs safety equipment which may be a lot more than just one company and this is with a simplified scenario depending on what the final technology requires what happens if external sensors or signal broadcasters are required by avs just to function reliably im thinking especially of snowy or icy conditions where the cars on board sensors may not be able to detect the edge or center of a road reliably right now roads and road signals are mostly paid for by the public if an av kills someone and it was icy and there is a question about whether some road implanted signaling device failed does that make that citycountystate partially responsible this is likely to provide for entirely new departments of lawyers being required in many legal firms to handle the increased demand for both prosecuting and defense lawyers
168,i feel like we all know there will be loss of life although every time it happens the media acts all crazy and completely ignores the fact that self driving cars once networked will be far safer than people the media sucks
169,guys the tesla bot network that elon was bragging about that controls reddit is taking a dark turn
170,don norman the design of everyday things guy was giving a talk that i was listening to while at work and he brought up an important question that i dont hear about driver less cars how will the car signal to a pedestrian that it has seen them and what should occur next a person can make eye contact and signal to a pedestrian with a gesture but a modern car with no driver doesnt have any way to signal intent from the front except for turn signals how will this work at scale when there are other cars in the area what happens when one car decides to stop and another doesnt what about bikes or scooters how drivers react in various countries differ as well how will the car react when placed in a city with a different car culture than it was produced in what about different cars from different countries in one place what about cars with human and ai drivers on the same road all of this has to be hashed out before driverless cars become a significant presence but i rarely hear anyone who thinks well all have driverless cars in years talk about these life or death problems
171,i have my commercial license i have driven medium trucks tankers dumps flatbeds excavators backhoes and operated around gas electric steep slopes etc etc with all that i feel safer around leaking gas lines and failed power lines than on public roads ive seen that some people simply have no business behind the wheel but in the us its a necessity to drive whether or not you can or should you do thats the problem so im all for sdvs and mass transit make a license harder to get and maintain also use your signals you stupid dicks if your merging you dont have the right of way
172,i mean the hardest part is making a car that can drive automated mixed in with human drivers if we could magically instantaneously give everyone a self driving car that would eliminate a lot of the complications if every car was automated we wouldnt need turn signals brake lights probably not even headlights cars could communicate with each other without visual signals wouldnt even need traffic lights and stop signs lanes wouldnt need to be painted almost yearly in multiple areas it would save cities billions in construction and maintenance costs
173,somebody who was haphazardly trained by a parent who only remembers half the rules thinks signaling is optional and doesnt know what to do when they see a stopped school bus and still has a license that is the kind of driver we have on the road we need to improve on the typical driver not a great driver perfect is the enemy of good
174,youre right the current level of a typical autopilot can be compared with a mentally disabled semi blind person who doesnt remember anything doesnt predict anything sees very little without understanding what it is and makes decisions to turn accelerate or decelerate based on primitive associations like the white curve goes to the right turn right an autopilot doesnt build a d model like we do and doesnt project its desirable trajectory in that model this is why those teslas managed to drive directly into huge red yellow firefigther trucks they didnt build the d model didnt build the trajectory and didnt realise that the trajectory cannot go thru a fire ruck and predicting the likelihood of that weird driver in front changing the lane without a signal is obviously far beyond its abilities ps have a motorcycle too and totally confirm that the awareness of a typical biker is far beyond that of a typical car driver just because risk their life while drivers risk their cars paint
175,its officially the future tfw turning off automatic updates means im personally liable for when my car crashes into someone or when my car was pushed the automatic update to public_safety_protocol_v but the download cut off halfway through because my wireless carrier throttled my bandwidth midway through it and my car glitched in a school zone and hip checked a nine year old at mph
176,the real advancements will come with distributed inter car communication as mentioned above imagine all the cars on the a certain road as a interconnected network of sorts each car talks to its neighbors in real time about its position and speed with inter car communication cars may be able to communicate with neighboring cars and sense possible problems about to occur if a car gathers information from another car heading towards it with speed and relative position data it can calculate the forthcoming collision and try to prevent it this sort of system would make collisions very rare and would be a significant advantage over human drivers
177,i grew up in germany got my license there lived there for years then i moved to the us had to take a test to get a drivers license here and have been driving here for years now yes the difference is absolutely real i dont remember how many hours of driving school you have to take in germany but it was a lot in the us its about half as much and your terrible driver parent can teach you the rest therefore perpetuating bad habits in germany i had to take a one hour driving test in real traffic with situations demanding real control and decision making in the us the driving test was on an enclosed parking lot with nobody else on it was minutes long and involved exactly three things parallel parking three way turn and stopping at a stop sign drivers in germany generally follow rules and respect other drivers they may be speeding but they typically let people merge lanes use their signals and pay attention to traffic of course there are exceptions but they are exceptions in the us egocentric drivers who only have their own interest in mind are the norm you have to plan two miles out to get to the right lane if your exit is coming up because you never know who will let you merge when you have to get off the freaking highway people drive slow on the left lane you get overtaken on the left right anything goes people keep no proper distance to other cars because that would mean you leave room for other cars to merge into your lane on my commute i see about of drivers around me on their phone or otherwise not paying attention to the road
178,there are a lot of subtle human to human signals in traffic pedestrian to driver signals about whether they are about to step out into the road bicycle to driver signals etc it is important to get them right much harder than the problem of driving a known vehicle down a known empty road
179,i agree and its not just reddit its the industry too a colleague went to a transportation conference and shared his experience with us almost everything was about autonomous cars with very little emphasis on public transit or how the tech can be applied to public transit networks in an ideal world id like to see the tech improve existing public transit with cars filling in the gaps that arent covered adequately like the person who commented about his shiftslocation in this thread its sad because i really believe that this tech can provide cheap reliable and efficient transportation with no reason for anyone to own a car but it seems like the focus is on everyone owning a driverless car that will sit in the lot of the time in other words how can we sell as many cars as possible
180,this self driving cars will lead to a more fluid traffic network i imagine vehicles moving and interacting more like a fluid with mere inches separating each vehicle every vehicle can slow down speed up and stop at the exact same time
181,not to mention traffic lights and stops may no longer be needed cars approaching the same intersection may seemlessly adjust their spacing and speeds to pass through without impact theres a lot of ways road travel could get more efficient with basic networking
182,i think this is over played its hard to base a safety case upon sensors extrinsic to the vehicle because its difficult to verify data integrity in any case the vehicle must be safe in isolation eg it must pass an elk test in fog at night either by seeing through the fog or driving within the limits of its sensors intra vehicle data cannot replace conventional signals because human drivers are still legal at eis so the manoeuvre cadence cant increase vehicle manufacturers have little incentive to share data because if eg fords cooperate with fords then network effects will favour big players freeze out disruptive new entrants legislation may therefore be required to force sharing however integrity is harder if the standard is open this sort of distributed asynchronous system is really hard to police no i dont think blockchain is the solution i suppose it could be done with public key cryptography a really big database of vins but then integrity verification would depend on internet access which might not be dependable eg in tunnels or remote areas i therefore think it will be limited to more controlled environments like road trains controlled by single operators or non safety critical uses better traffic data for strategic routing decisions as distinct from tactical manoeuvre decisions

184,meanwhile humans cant even use their turn signals to communicate to nearby drivers in which direction they intend to go
185,inter car communication is a terrible idea you think we have a problem with hacking now open an local network api to the people around you no thanks
186,could become more efficientcould also become easier to hack and take over since all the vehicles are connected on a network since the technology doesnt exist these comments are purely speculation
187,unrelated to security but a thought you spurred emergency response times would drastically improve with self driving networks need lanes clear to get emergency vehicles through consider it done need to keep people from entering the area near an ongoing incident done need to evacuate people from an area in an orderly and efficient fashin done
188,sure most people know how to handle a way stop run up to it as fast as possible come to a complete stop or not sometimes its just okay to slow down just a little and go look around now that theyre there and have no idea whose turn it is wave someone else to go whose turn its not stop and wait until the next cross traffic car thats a block away arrives and makes a complete stop sit there when its really busy then decide to turn on their left turn signal while everyone is trying to figure out whose turn it is andor start to go then stop then go again and make a turn with no signal at the last second s
189,we could make robot animals that connect to the car network so they can track when the animals jump into the road
190,not when cars can stop simultaneously at an intersection to allow pedestrians to pass im not sure what you are saying the difference between the two is my point is traffic flow in cities will largely remain unchanged as likely there will be even more pedestrians and cyclists in the future who will still need traffic signals and traffic stoppages
191,throwing a bunch of money randomly into the stock market or worse crypto is a great way to lose all of it the odds are astronomical against it actually making a significant amount of money in the near term to the point that it would rescue you from your current situation i cant speak to software engineering as a path but it sounds like an area where someone with a medical degree and unique skills even without a degree would have a very unique niche to fill im sure medical software companies employ doctors in some capacity already start researching and making networking connections there go to conferences you wouldnt normally go to etc make the job change without wasting time and money on a degree

193,well maybe easier on the tires but sorry the blinker and turn lane should be the signal to other drivers from behind no one can see the front tires and when coming the other direction at mph on a chandler street youre going to see that signal first as well if you do get rear ended and pushed into that mph traffic then you risk a horrific head on accident the odds are low but consequences are high thats why its called defensive driving
194,sometimes i like to take the long way home just to unwind and see the scenery this has already been discussed a few months ago routing software ui needs to get a lot better and support waypoints detours etc that said not only is this not a really difficult problem to solve its in the interest of the fleets to make it easy as they can make more money this is especially true for longer trips where you want to stop and see the sights or hit antique shops on the way or something sometimes i just drive to the park during lunch and take a nap in my seat this is a better example i think you could do it but at least at first it would be expensive so you wont once the capacity of the network is at scale i do think this might get cheaper but it will probably always cost something sometimes i sit for longer than necessary in the walmart parking lot in order to catch up on texts this isnt a big deal i expect the car will wait for minutes or so to let you put in your destination a lot of this depends on how much idle room is available sometimes i pull a sudden u turn because i saw something interesting see the first reply while you might be less inclined to do it it shouldnt be a problem once there is better route planning
195,people are already using uberlyft instead of ambulances to some degree nd and rd order changes are hard to see so this is just a thought experiment your challenge just got me thinking i could imagine a reasonable situation where every fleet sdc had lights and could go into emergency mode this mode allowed them to assume right away and ignore signals like emergency vehicles do now for your average citizen this would be locked down to certain destinations like hospitals and such i could see an additional fee or something to keep it from being abused probably the best way would be to have the hospital charge you if you dont get services rendered getting the person who needs medical care from pointa to hospital will always be faster than getting an ambulance from pointb to pointa to hospital its situational if pointb to pointa is faster or slower than pointa to hospital if it is you could always consider ambulances to be an allowed emergency destination and intersect at a point optimal for both the ambulance and the sdc to get meet the ambulance to finish the journey for certain people the destination could be unlocked this would allow a broad range of first responders to get on scene quickly without maintaining vast fleets specialized vehicles like fire trucks would still be needed but i could see almost all government owned vehicles going to fleet avs
196,i dont think you are disagreeing with me that much all these companies imo want a patent that will potentially make billions from the uber like companies like maybe alphabet isnt the company that wants that task of running a self driving car transportation network but also that doesnt mean the technology isnt almost there
197,the problem with self driving cars is trust im not entirely sure that i trust a self driving car to take me where i tell it to every single time maybe the car decides that ive been to the liquor store or the casino too many times this month maybe the local authorities are quietly routing me around a traffic disruption or maybe theyre deciding what i need to see or not see out my windshield or what protests or political assembly i should attend or avoid sure you have the right to keep and bear arms but the autonomous vehicle network wont take you to the gun store a business paying for seo or outright higher placement on the search is one thing but what happens if mcdonalds pays your automaker for preferential destination placement take me to burger king please hal im sorry dave im afraid i cant do that how about the mcdonalds down the road and thats not even taking things like arrest or abduction into account
198,the problem with self driving cars is people specifically that they dont actually make the world better for people so theyre really not that great an investment the most optimal flow of traffic would be one without traffic lights where self driving cars are all on a national network and can run constantly without ever running into each other the issue is that this wouldnt allow for people to cross streets and overpassesunderpasses arent really the solution to that we should be designing cities for people not for cars people live here and are impacted by these things cars dont have feelings and dont give a shit many of the happiest cities in the world already do this
199,now combine that with in vehicle audio monitoring or linking to a smart home and through that to social media and you can make sure that maybe one supporter in ten makes it to the campaign rally but every single counter protestor is there and maybe even a few would be counter protestors who werent planning to go but now that im here ripe for abuse is an understatement and were still not talking about the fact that the system sees no difference between say a cop with a valid arrest warrant questionable enough already and a thug with a grudge against an ex threatening an autonomous vehicle network administrator
200,no no ists not perception and prediction tasks yes anything else is a lot of optimization and higher control theory take eg the local trajectory planning and risk calculation thats simple mathematics these need no ais also behause they are hardly to train as to the best of my knowledge no unbiased data exists to train sich networks but yes the data on which algorithms further down the self driving car pipeline operate are applied and will most lilely always be results of ais
201,from what ive seen mostly from ai addict the programs are overreacting by responding to situations that dont exist or misinterpreting the given situation tesla in particular has trouble because mr musk insists on not using lidar or radar on tesla vehicles which makes things a lot harder for even advanced neural networks to train even with millions of miles of training data
202,again your argument has no connection to reality real world is not a noisy image generated to fool the ai existing ai systems are already very good at driving and are getting very close to human level yes you can trick them but you can also trick humans into driving into a bridge support with just a few lines on the highway i almost got into a horrible accident once because the stupid workers left two sets of lane markings on the highway and it wasnt obvious which one i should follow i would wager times ai has a significantly better reaction to something unexpected happening and can plan a route hundreds of times per second to avoid a collision i would wager times ai will not fall asleep i would wager times ai will not drive drunk or high i would wager times ai will pay attention to the road more than a human no human is going to confuse the side of a white truck for a cloud and crash into it humans crash into trucks cars humans all the time ai will improve it will make fewer and fewer errors as it learns humans will stay the same ai becoming better than humans is inevitable
203,how many ota of critical systems has tesla done and how many had to be retracted due to unforseen behaviour yeah its almost like they have an extensive testing and approval process in place for the fact that this is the st time they had to roll an ota back based on signals i might add there are reported accidents as a result of the retracted ota much ado about nothing this
204,safety critical systems shouldnt be beta tested on the public at all then how should tesla gather training data for their neural network
205,there is no connection between anything he would have said on or before that date and the vehicle shown in the video
206,keep in mind that tesla is heavily reliant on neural networks so even the engineers dont understand exactly how things changed and how they may affect specific situations they know how it behaved in the many simulated situations but reality will always be a bit different tesla needs tons of data from real situations to train the system if you only had people from around tesla factories feed it data the system would become great at driving near those facilities but not necessarily elsewhere this is why such a public training data gathering must be conducted
207,i really wanted one until i started looking into the issues with them currently the only thing they seem to have over some of the other cars is their charging network and the speed at which they can charge the fact that theyve been promising full self driving cars for the past three for four years makes me doubt that theyre going to crack it before another company does
208,also prime example of ad hominem attacks signaling loss of argument
209,seriously like legalizing drugs self driving cars are going to absolutely kill citypolice revenue from officer citations and court fines like the drug system theres an entire network of money circling around traffic violations i dont think theyre going to go down easilyits sad for your safety
210,why as a human youre much more dangerous other people are at risk even to the extent that compulsary rd party insurance removes the risk of you costing other parties money theres still the risk you could maim or kill them should people still have the option to drive extremely old unsafe cars in many juristictions classic car enthusiasts arent allowed to take their old cars on the roads also synergy between autonomous vehicles means the road networks will work better without human drivers even a small number of human drivers will cause problems
211,you presume self driving cars are networked i believe they wont be they should be autonomous only reacting to those around them thus it doesnt care if the cars around it are automatic or manual driven
212,lead time and context are much more important than what the signal is and both leave room for argument
213,if youre really concerned with everyones safety in that hypothetical story networked self driving cars are the best chance of no one getting hurt the cars will detect the child moving toward the street long before a human would and can run through all contingency plans and find the best one in addition the car will already be driving conservatively based on data obscured sides of road in a way that most humans wouldnt i suppose there are rare situations where something changes very suddenly and the laws of physics now dictate that something is going to get hit but even then the car can plan faster than a person could and minimize the damage
214,hey opposing car a kid is about to jump in front of you i know you cant see it yet but trust me you should brake hard and swerve m to the right im really not comfortable with the idea of my car acting on some information sent wirelessly by some untrusted party
215,maybe not at first but those things could be ironed into the ai eventually and maybe theres information that other vehicles round the corner can broadcast for your car to receive like a kid sleding down a hill that you will have no way of knowing we may initially have better judgement with visual cues but we wont have the network of sensors sharing information about the surrounding areas through wireless communication you made an interesting point though
216,maybe not at first but those things could be ironed into the ai eventually and maybe theres information that other vehicles round the corner can broadcast for your car to receive like a kid sleding down a hill that you will have no way of knowing we may initially have better judgement with visual cues but we wont have the network of sensors sharing information about the surrounding areas through wireless communication you made an interesting point though
217,sure it would it would see the moving kids see the direction they are moving and the speed they are moving mph walking kid less dangerous a risk than the mph sliding kid threat track and predict course remember you are thinking laddy lah driving oh crap kid brake swerve that would never happen with the sdc it would see and be predicting the kids position now and in the future ft before you are even aware their are kids present maybe a mile before the kids as the cars coming the other way send a message out on the mesh network hey kids playing here you get the idea their would be huge intercommunication
218,ummm lots of people dont like to ride around in other peoples filth if they dont have to lots of people dont want to wait the time it might take to have a cab dispatched especially during peak periods parking costs its not like my driveway is going to disappear anytime soon and most americans dont live in high density urban areas most of the arguments made for self driving cars are also arguments for much stronger public transportation networks in urban cities and intercity rail networks for connecting those cities all technology that is quite well proven not controversial incredibly safe and relatively inexpensive the self driving advocates are starting to push the shared ownership model because it is becoming increasingly apparent that self driving cars will not be deliverable at unit costs of less than figures theyre trying to in any way possible rationalize the high cost of a self driving vehicle to support further public equity market funding of self driving car research in the context of the lack of an otherwise viable business case btw maintenance costs on a car are largely a function of miles driven and are almost certainly to be dramatically greater for self driving cars due to the extra required redundancy safety systems and the life critical nature of their components insurance costs are highly correlated to miles driven long term interest rates are low so there is little downside to low capital intensity and cars are cheaper than ever those worried about capital intensity can simply buy cheaper cars what about all the extra fuel that a taxi cab fleet takes to move from user to user ever consider that will higher capital utilization intensity of a very expensive asset a sdc with high operating costs be better than a cheap asset a human driven car used very unintensively
219,i wouldnt put much faith in the voxel map first the fact that its being built entirely from fairly low resolution images alone means its accuracy is at least moderately suspect from the beginning again great tech demoits impressive they can even do that much but its not enough when lives are at stake every demo ive seen including greens bears a pretty tenuous connection to the cars actual surroundings i might trust it to keep me away from curbs and other cars but certainly not to avoid a shards of broken glass for instance both the accuracy and spatial resolution are way too low second it doesnt change the ontological problem herethe system simply needs far more contextual understanding and common sense knowledge than it likely has to make intelligent inferences from what it sees whether its pixels voxels or both the system may know a flickering cluster of giant cubes is feet ahead of my bumper but what exactly does that mean is it safe or not this is a question about facts of the worldphysics materials causality etcnot mere geometry third even building a genuinely accurate voxel map would require more ontological awareness than the system appears to have in other words the process is circular just as it is in the human visual cortex we use depth cues to recognize the objects in front of us then use our understanding of those objects to refine and disambiguate those depth cues and repeat the process until we achieve a stable view of our surroundings the process doesnt just go in one direction so feeding in a rough pass of voxel estimation is only a first step many iterative steps remain hence i remain concerned teslas live in a dangerously cartoonish version of reality
220,remote operation would require a safety critical zero latency high bandwidth connection given the issues that the connected vehicle piece is having with dsrc then i dont think we will see such a capability for at least another decade if then insuring such remote operations would be a major issue surely much more efficient to just have some roving technicians a bit like the automobile association tow trucks that can turn up and resolve issues on the spot
221,g networks have a round trip latency of about milliseconds you can buy hobby kits that allow one to pilot a drone or rc car over a g network over a video feed how safety critical it need be i suppose would depend on the nature of the intervention googles cars seem to get hung up in unusual situations like construction zones accident scenes or even chaotic parking lots places where a remote human operator doesnt need to go very fast at all to navigate the problem
222,i mean lets be realistic waymo wants this swept under the rug as quickly and quietly as possible all this person needs to do is start going on local networks and talking about how he got brake checked by an autonomous car and how dangerous they are and waymo would probably buy him a brand new truck to get him to shut up
