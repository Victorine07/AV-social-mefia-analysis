0,well depends what were talking about if were talking private cars its definitely not the solution if were talking public transport it does have an impact im working in this field trying to test autonomous shuttles in connection with existing connections it would make public transport cheaper safer more inclusive and more efficientit would indeed make jobs disappear but part of them will further exist just în the office looking at a few shuttles at a time also we are studying on demand transport and are trying to have a lead start with this before uber and co so that it stays public at the same time we are trying to see how the gathered data can help us its a field worth exploring even if we dont yet know what all the advantages are it could at some point make owning a car obsolete since you can just call a bus through an app
1,its worth mentioning that the taxi industry would fight hard against something like that theyve already done so in the past regarding private small business taxi companies im sure a google funded car service would carry more financial clout though
2,at some point yes computers are just better than humans at some tasks currently theyre not but they will be and once all cars are autonomous thered be great efficiency gains in terms of traffic much of traffic is caused by human behavior such as braking too hard or lane changing too much which causes ripple effects that caused large slow downs autonomous cars can be connected to a network which controls how each individual car behaves and theyd all drive optimally for the good of all on private roads let people do whatever they want but in public no
3,this is a delicate question it depends on a lot of factors there would be vast differences in attitudes between urban suburban and rural drivers their access to public transport would be vastly different as well and their access to features such as wireless charging accident avoidance infrastructure communication vehicle to vehicle for example would all be different based on whats available also there is a major set of people who enjoy driving this could continue via private roads though which would mostly be a large improvement in liability and safety driving could be a dedicated hobby which may prove out to be excellent compared to today
4,no but id support private insurance companies charging an arm and a leg if people want to continue driving them
5,yeah its the same people who object to traffic cameras on privacy grounds dude you are literally operating a motor vehicle on a public street in public which is the opposite of private last time i checked
6,yeah its the same people who object to traffic cameras on privacy grounds dude you are literally operating a motor vehicle on a public street in public which is the opposite of private last time i checked
7,abolish single family housing but i like my privacy yard garden
8,if self driving cars do become the norm which i do not think will happen in our life time human operated vehicles will eventually have to die out because the human makes an exponential amount of errors relative to a self driving car the reason i do not think it will happen soon is because for there to be any sense of autonomous driving on the current system of roads there needs to be a minimum uniform code in the algorithm such that cars of different makes can communicate with each other say for example two cars traveling in opposite directions meet across from each other in an intersection and both want to turn east when humans operate vehicles this is easy because its just plain human interaction on the other hand if these cars are self driving both cars need to know when where and at what speed the other car is going to make the east turn why because if they dont they will go at the same time and hit each other trying to make the east turn at the same time this is a fundamental problem transitioning to an autonomous transportation system and i dont think private car manufacturers will be open to sharing their autonomous driving code with each other so in short i dont think you have to worry about existing in a world where you will be forced to adopt an autonomous driving vehicle
9,im of the view that while individual effort alone will not solve this problem we actually do have some amount of power here and that power is in the form of our knowledge our votes and our dollars in terms of knowledge the idea is somewhat straightforward but i think its under appreciated which is becoming aware of the technologies were using and whats happening behind the scenes with them instead of being very passive users of technologies and algorithms more deliberate choices should be made we have to ask ourselves how algorithms change the decisions were making or that others are making about us if you look at what facebook is doing they announced changes to their products how theyre going to support encryption of messages and support short lived posts that disappear afetr some time i think thats a direct outcome of pushback from users the other is our votes and basically backing representatives who understand the nuances here and who take consumer protection seriously in just the last year or two there have been a number of us senators and representatives who proposed bills related to privacy and algorithm bias and so on and being aware of whos doing what in the voting decisions and finally with dollars the idea is vote with your wallet we ultimately have the option to walk away from these tools so if we feel like a company is using our data and we dont find it acceptable for some people that might be where they draw the line and walk away all that said i think individual action wont suffice tech firms have to cooperate and regulators need to push them to do so without going overboard with regulation
10,thanks for the informed question i am hopeful i think we can and should build a framework to evaluate the inputs the models and the outputs there are statistical criteria one uses in say regression models to assess how good a model is they need to be extended to include tests for things such as bias in the inputs outputs gender race etc implications for privacy security etc procedurally i also think that algorithms deployed in socially significant settings should be audiedvalidated by a team other than the team that developed the model such a team can be within the org or a rd party but such procedures will also help you may also find the area of fairness accountability transparency in ml fatml interesting
11,nothing but you can always design algorithms that dont need to exclusively trust one person contrary to the answers here cryptography is not necessarily the answer it can be part of the answer crypto is designed to solve two problems integrity tampering and privacy eavesdropping it is not a tool to ensure that the originator is not lying to your or is unfriendly you can solve the problem with something akin to distributed consensus if out of cars ahead of you say that they are braking due to high traffic around the bend but tells you to speed up you can slow down on the assumption that a majority of the people your encounter are not dicks think of it as finding trackers and seeders to a torrent once in a while you encounter malicious operatives but most of the time things work out quite ok and the systems are designed to compensate for noise hijacking corruption people entering and exiting the network etc
12,were at the point where concerning numbers of people dont even realize cities ie human settlements are supposed to be for people in the first place rather than private motor vehicle playgrounds
13,you see elon with his galaxy brain and big boy pants has the solution self driving humans with neuralink drilled into your skull youll just be in perfect time with the cars as long as the implant doesnt kill you and you dont mind a private company having access to your brain you can even pay a monthly premium subscription to get rid of the ads that fill your vision and constantly ring in your ears
14,reduce traffic and space needed for traffic quite the opposite if anything they would encourage more private transportation further increasing congestion
15,simple divide up train carts like gondolas people can have their own private compartment rather then big ones elons tesla tunnel or whatever is essentially just that minus it being on a track and connected but in all honesty wealthy individuals want to sell as much gas cars insurance plans road work tires etc we dont have trains because it threatens giant corporations business models its the same reason we have had to fighting for green energy coal and oil dont want their businesses to become obsolete
16,and my response as a cyclist is yes let me pay road tax ill happily pay it because when i do i get to have my own private cyclist only bit of road that car drivers cant use and it will need to stretch all across the country you know like roads they oddly dont like that as my response
17,no one thing will save us we need a diversified approach to transportation to provide people with options the main issue was looking for that one technology to solve everything currently that is the car this type of thinking is bad for most problem solving in general the car is a particular technology that is good for traveling outwards to a particular spot that no one else is the original idea was imagined as flying through space on a freeway not sitting in traffic we currently use it to converge all on the same point at the same time like hammering in a screw we need diversified options that are all equally viable having one technology was optimal for moving wealth from the public into few private uncountable hands diversification is a long term planning where as profit driven thinking favours short term reactionary thinking or lack of thinking we know what needs to be done and have so for the past years the issue is that there are forces actively trying to stop that from happening in order to continue gaining profit moving it from the many towards the few the latest example is elon musk if people are really engineer types and really interested in efficiencies then look no further than the bike the most efficient machine ever created for transportation it stands alone nothing even comes close i know i am preaching to the choir here but yes love you guys this sub is great
18,depends on where you live but you could apply this same argument to buses rail etc what moving everything to electricity including buses rail etc allows us to do is to get the most efficient energy generation out of non renewable sources in the short term implement new large scale renewables like wind and tidal and decentralize energy production with things like rooftop solar whether we like it or not for large parts of the us public transit is not viable yes we absolutely need to prioritize transit where it is viable and get cars out of our cities but in rural areas moving private vehicles to electric is probably the best solution we can hope for
19,i like cars but it would be nice if the government would work on building a more efficient train network that helps people get around the country better and takes the current network out of private hands the ticket prices are unnecessarily extortionate due to industry corruption and the tracks and trains are maintained poorly and with not much high speed link development it would just be nice not to have to drive to get everywhere i need to go people could spend that time productively or read a book or watch a film instead
20,nothing intrinsically wrong with it in my mind but people have a tendency to take up too much space with this stuff and then not actually foot the bill for the infrastructure in the end i have the same issues with this as with golfing uses public space for an exclusive private activity often at the expense of taxpayers golfing is worse though in this respect
21,i would think that with less space taken up by suburban sprawl and whiny hoa neighborhoods auto enthusiasts would have more land and less restrictions placed on them for building private road courses rallyx courses whatever youre into and imagine the amount of dirt cheap projects you could buy if people who dont like driving could get rid of their cars in favor of public transit
22,if you had your way would you eminent domain all suburbs and force them into apartment complexes with bus or train access if suburbs were required to pay into public systems what they cost out of them suburbs would look nothing like they do in the us with rare exceptions us suburbs built to the modern standard are financially impossible theyre subsidized by urban cores and even on a private level its a glorified ponzi scheme never mind that in the us the modern suburban design youre familiar with is frequently the only thing youre legally allowed to build eminent domain mother fucker youre not even allowed to convert your own house into a duplex its illegal and thats not even broaching the subject of how expensive and inefficient suburban design is and how it embraces inefficient taxation as a matter of course
23,since you are seem to be displaying libertarian views let me tell you a secret a bicycle is the most libertarian mode of transportation it is free to ride requires minimal infrastructure compared to cars or transit doesnt require a license and is an object within the manufacturing capabilities of a private individual this is how we can all tell the libertarian movement in this country is full of it because they should be hopping up and down for an end to car centric infrastructure spending and the urban experiment i mean come on how is an hoa libertarian
24,i doubt that here is why i get that greyhound stations in the us are awful that the buses are even worse etc but thats not the way it is everywhere the combined long distance trainbus station in my town has nothing to envy your average airport it looks great its got fantastic parking its got great shops restaurants nice waiting areas and all the services of any airport but without the fucking security and other annoyances you can just show up a minute before departure and go straight to your bus and even if you dont have a ticket just show up and buy one there are buses departing pretty much anywhere you wanna go every few minutes and the buses are fucking awesome the seats you get are close to the best first class in any airline you get a partition for privacy the foot rest comes up and they recline degrees into an awesome bed pillows blanket tv usb ports wifi etc on long trips you get drinks food and so on pics from various companies http cdnflechabuscomarwp content newuploadscamajpg http scontentfmdq fnafbcdnnetvt ___njpg _nc_cat_nc_ocaqldkcfaozwpimwgrmvlyjnlocogcjxpgzuvpytaxe_axibsctmjeqbs_nc_htscontentfmdq fnaohebddacffbcoedea so all the legroom in the world the seats turn into an actual bed nice cars entertainment wifi etc and people still dont fucking want them i dont fucking want them people will only take them because they are dirt cheap compared to planes but if flying is an option and you can afford it you get it on very short routes say km or less they certainly beat a plane every time up to km they are still an option because flying will take you an hour of flight plus an extra hour at least at each airport so hours total if you are lucky so the hours the bus takes aint so bad but beyond that no way and for actually long trips i have been on hour trips by bus that wouldve been a hour flight and its fucking awful nobody wants to be trapped in a hour flight but its the only option you have to cross the ocean you dont want to be trapped in a hour bus ride either if you can trade a hours bus ride for a minute flight you will
25,until we have private self driving planes now were playing chess
26,eh i dont know about that the privacy of a driverless car sounds nice but safety is still an issue also given the example choice of a hour flight vs a hour driverless ride i dont think most people would choose the option that takes five times longer however i do think their prediction about splitting trips taking a driverless car to a distant airport for cheaper air travel might actually come true if the ideal future of safe private and affordable driverless cars comes to pass

28,the idea of being able to get into a car at pm and go to sleep having the car wake me up every or hours to fuel up and them be able to arrive at a location many hundred miles away at am sounds like a huge game changer for me red eye travel but in the privacy of your own car
29,why mile up my private vehicle when my employer pays for plane tickets
30,uber destroyed the valet business local city permits for said valet spots and pay to park for citiesprivate companies
31,individually this sounds fantastic and i could easily use this instead of a redeye flight then i think about that flight it typically has a lot of other people and there are thousands of redeye flights daily thats a lot of traffic if all of those people rent a private room that rides across the highways instead thats a shit ton of extra traffic maybe its more efficient because of the resources used to get me there but that doesnt mean i get where im going in time if i spend the majority of that time sitting still also i remember that after the average temperature of the earth rose something fierce because so many planes were grounded they were no longer in the air reflecting some of the suns heat back into space if this significantly reduces air travel it could unintentionally speed up global warming of course this is not my area of expertise so obviously i could be unnecessarily concerned because ive fallen victim of the uss alarmist news entertainment cycle
32,plus you get privacy inside able to set the music and entertainment completely to your liking detour for snacks or other needs or just cancel the trip if suddenly the news says things are bad over there once the roads are entirely self driving higher speed limits will also be likely especially for the highways domestic flights will struggle against such competition
33,bus doesnt equal a car a car is private and personal im willing to accept a longer travel time vs an airline if i can be in my own space at my own pace also less pollution airplanes and shipping barges emit hideous amounts of particulates and pollution cars ices might not me much better but the ground fleet is electrifying faster than the air fleet
34,youre ignoring the convenience of having your own vehicle at your destination the flexibility a private vehicle provides to make your own itinerary schedule and the lower cost ignoring the fixed costs of vehicle ownership
35,while you have less privacy you also have much more space and comfort on a train plus is a technology already existing then you take the autonomous carpooling to do the last mile from the station to home
36,not to mention that if you kit out the car with wifi you can also work on the way wherever you go with increased privacy with planes you have a bunch of interruptions then you have peeper mceavesdrop looking at your screen as you put accounting on blast which is suboptimal
37,well travelling in an autonomous car doesnt equal at your own pace it is equal to the pace of the ai and what the car chooses to drive you at additionally the topic confuses multiple topics commercial travel vs private travel im sure if you had your own helicopter or small business jet youd take that over your car simply because its faster private helo in your own space at own pace but guess what its cost prohibitive you touch on a point though commuters who want private space in their own vehicle this type of materialism is what drivers up traffic congestion further to that private ownership in a private vehicles leads to increased pollution and whoa you cant compare airlines with shipping barges at least airlines are using biofuels and going electric cruise ships etc use bunker fuels which are nasty edit adding links for flying vs driving pollution climate math of flying vs driving
38,this reminds me of an ancedote about steve wozniak things that you may not know about steve wozniak the first story surrounds his business card an object that is made of metal and looks as if it was d printed from star treks uss enterprise while it looks exactly what a successful geeks should look like the reality is somewhat different according to woz this card was born of necessity not pomposity after the events of all jets be they private or public were not allowed to carry steel utensils all knives spoons and forks had to be made of plastic this fazed woz who was very fond of an airborne steak so he circumvented these cutlery restrictions by creating a metal business card that allowed him to cut his steak in the style to which he was accustomed
39,if they can get the actual operating cost low enough it could conceivably become cheaper per mile to use a ride hailing service rather than owning your own car fuelpower would be equal of course and a vanishingly small expense on electrichybrid vehicles but depreciation would be split among all the fares as would maintenance costs and battery replacements and other expenses which a car owner must shoulder themselves now imagine that the service you get rides from is a nationwide network you can hail an autocab get in sleep for hours wake up halfway across the country and then leave the car for someone else to use like you would do with a rental car or a uhaul and this doesnt just have to be in big cities taxis and ridesharing services usually only work in big cities because you have to pay the driver enough to make a living so you have to have enough traffic to keep him busy but if its all automated with the costs being mainly depreciation maintenance and fuelpower then suddenly it makes sense to provide service in areas with only moderate demand a car that only gets used for hours a day to take people to and from work and the grocery store in a town of k people might still turn a profit and be cheaper than individual car ownership for the end user all this adds up to a future where private vehicle ownership is for the wealthy the rural and enthusiasts
40,i live in a big city and it already doesnt make economical sense for me to own a car public transport uberuber like and private rental covers every use case for me at a fraction of the cost of ownership adding fully automated transport as a service for short and medium distance trips would be an excellent service that id use
41,in a vacuum maybe everyone throwing their keys over to their new autonomous chauffeur forgets how far away this stuff really is sure theyre working in clear and sunny la but inches of snow in buffalo detroit where pot holes grow more than grass i dont think so not to mention the legal ramifications when people stop being at fault companies become at fault and we all know how good companies are at doing that you really trust tesla to value your safety over their bottom line not to mention security and privacy and that some people actually like driving when you only look at this from the perspective of dae not trust human drivers it seems a lot closer than it realistically is
42,this could be mitigated by putting roadways in major cities underground right now it is dangerous and impractical because of how badly people drive doing this would eliminate pedestrian danger free up huge amounts of space and create walkable cities with the convenience of private transportation
43,my only argument is that if testing needs to be done they can do it on private testing tracks and should have these test have the developers act as the test subjects to walk in front of these cars to recreate the tempe incident i dont believe testing these cars over the next to years when no one is liable for fatalities and uber can simply pay off the family justifies the greater good of public safety anyone that can justify this based on statistics is cold soul of a person the outcome will be that people die at a lower rate while millions will also lose their jobs to ai and also die a slow death
44,yes but all planes are talking to or more control rooms and know where all other planes are and possible obstacles unfortunately we cannot have the same guarantee with self driving cars as obstacles can appear from anywhere eg bicycle rider makes a turn without looking effectively best solution is gps everyone but then theres the issues of privacy etc
45,i think this is precisely where were headed but maybe eventually a step further wherein youll subscribe to a car service like porsche volvo and i think ford are already piloting and youll pay for your usage up to a certain limit youll order a car ahead to be where you want it at a certain time and it will drive itself to you and youll be able to only get the car you want or need for what youre doing commuting to work by yourself smart car sized micro compact taking the family on a road trip big van night on the town sleek luxury car upsides no maintenance potential savings vs ownership once the infrastructure is in place and the processes are streamlined and efficient and the cars are built to commercial standards of durability think of a semi trucks k mile overhaul cycle downsides private ownership becomes very expensive and only the eccentric and wealthy do it imagine how you think of people who own and ride horses for fun now whither racing thats an oversimplification of what could be as the logistics are staggering and the mindset shift away from personal ownership will take a long time but there are so many upsides that i welcome it as long as i can opt out and keep driving my dirty old benzo until it finally rusts into the ground
46,private public transport
47,i cant even possibly imagine it oh wait i can its called a plane or a train or a bus weve had that technology for a century why are you so excited about the possibility that you could do it in a private car instead
48,a private bus
49,cars have to be somewhere if not randomly parked in public or private spaces all over town then they circle aimlessly on the roads waiting to be summoned so we get peak rush hour all the time this doesnt sound like an economic win
50,this is a dystopian nightmare where only corporations own private property and they get to determine who is allowed to drive and where something like this will have a much harder time working in america versus europe being able to take a spontaneous trip anywhere is kind of the point and some people love driving this doesnt give people freedom it robs them of it and puts their decision about when to leave where to go and how to get there into the hands of corporations
51,fuck no we all cant at least i cant and i know others are like me maybe if i was in first class with some provided xanax with the legroom ive been on intentional flights too and just cant do it if they make cars that are private it wouldnt be half as bad especially if those cars at the concept with four seats facing into a middle area like a limo section if self driving is very reliable i see that being pretty normal or somewhat normal
52,so yeah me spending part of my day yesterday in this sub having a thoughtful conversation about deep sea autonomous boats for data collection was part of an act and im just here to stalk a mod who posts k upvote stories everyday there is no benefit to anyone to share this dudes stupidity and it is both the driver and the ops goal to get people watching the stunt which should be ignored and shunned for its danger and me saying something about it and getting a modicum of support has pissed you the hell off because apparently you really like the video too i wouldnt know truthfully because all youve done it attack me but ill infer until i hear otherwise for the dozenth time this story is trash and sharing it at all is encouraging stunt drivers to get more attention for life risking behavior the tech is cool and has potential show it off on private property imagine a bulletproof glass company decided to stand at the edge of their property and fire at their glass toward a public street filled with cars would you be cool with sharing that video i mean the tech had been proven right
53,besides the payment right but when you amortize a k vehicle over miles its damn cheap insurance too cheaper than the car payment plus private insurance by a long shot and you dont have to worry about maintenance storage owning the right vehicle for the job quick run to the store vs ski trip vs home depot trip no recurring maintenance since there are only two moving parts even an electric unicycle has more than two moving parts while the engine work is easier the rest of the car drive train wheels and tires brakes still require maintenance its the leasing vs owning argument no it isnt when you lease the car youre still the only user theres no economies gained when you car share you get to divide out the capital costs over many users which means each of you get to pay less its a very different economic model
54,bad idea the system private and public institutions would shift to turning the poor into organ banks for the rich especially with the move to the jobless economy
55,well theyd still have to die before the organs would become harvestable allowing private sale of organs would indeed be a terrible idea
56,steve jobs was not able to jump any list there is just a different list for different parts of the country because organs have a short shelf life however jobs had his own private jet so he could be anywhere in the us extremely rapidly at a moments notice
57,also steve had to buy properties in some states in order to get on the lists not something someone without deep pockets can do you dont need deep pockets to go from anywhere in the us at a moments notice via air wont be cheap but k to live is doable for many if youre not bring anything and you have tsa pre check you can jump into a plane in mins a private jet will only cut down travel time by a few hours
58,you dont need properties in the state to be on its list just the ability to get there within a certain time period having a private jet on call is what benefited him edit the reason i know about organ transplant comes from me being on the kidney waitlist in states for almost two years now contentuploadsunosmultiple_listingpdf the only restrictions optn has on where you can register are that you cant register at two locations in the same area because it doesnt lower your wait time i have yet to hear of a transplant center that wont list you because you dont live in the area vs you not being able to get to the center within a reasonable time frame if anyone has any legitimate source of a transplant center saying they wont transplant someone not living the region im open to receiving that information
59,i think he meant that he had a private jet to be anywhere very quickly not that he had a private jet so the transportation cost of the organ was less
60,this idea that we should accept self driving cars killing people is questionable at least to me now self driving tech comes from private companies who owns the code eh so nobody knows whats in the code eh so therefore consider this scenario a government with less than free and democractic ideals cough china cough implements a self driving software that does not recognise certain people dissenters as humans but their death would look like a traffic accident right in fact it would be perfectly easy for a government to decide for some features ex a hijab or sunglasses or even black skin to be not human and thus eliminate undesirables in traffic accidents as long as corporations can hide behind the auto car kills less than manual car defence the life or death of every person walking down the street will be decided based on a hidden piece of code that may or may not discriminate against you oh software discrimination totally happened before i remember reading something a while back about the face unlock tech being less accurate on asians than europeans imagine this sort of thing happening with a car coming towards you
61,for many and you can see posts hinting at it in this very thread its not about safety or convenience or whats best for everyone they just dont want to give up control same as the gun debate privacy vs security debate and so many others especially in the us if anything is going to happen the decision makers have to accept that its going to piss a lot of people off and just do it
62,when autonomous cars actually take over i doubt there will be actual private ownership transportation will be come an uber like experience you summon a car when you need to go somewhere and when you need to go home you wont actually own a car anymore
63,im not sure what youre talking about theres like minimum separate companies with level autonomous testing going on right now waymo has million miles driven in one day their fleet drives more miles than a human does in year hell those in a private beta can use googles waymo commercially right now in arizona
64,we have this in the uk its great but we do care who pays use of the system by non citizens is political attempts to verify eligibility are difficult because we dont have id cards thankfully also local trusts are allowed to allocate priorities so that there is a postcode lottery for access to some treatments variations in outcomes across the country but this is complicated because poor areas rich areas differ in so many ways private healthcare is legal doctors will often do private work after their nhs working day this has complicated effects upon the system patient outcomes its not obvious whether the overall effect is good or bad its not even obvious within the system whether going private is the best option advice can be conflicting because of politics as well as differences in clinical opinions so again it still matters who pays car insurance is a legal requirement in the uk which is sensible in theory but results in dysfunctional market behaviour with disproportionate costs for younger drivers i think that it should therefore be run as a government monopoly a national insurance service so that the risk is equally shared across the population the disadvantage of this sort of system is that it removes the incentive to reduce risk by eg buying lower performance vehicles with lower replacement value however most people have no more desire to damage their car than their health even if the government bears the financial cost so i think that the good outweighs the bad if healthcare car insurance are both provided by central government the savings associated with self driving cars are passed on to taxpayers rather than taken as profit by private industry which is probably a good thing because it may be argued that this will increase spending therefore growth more effectively
65,i wouldnt be surprised if they lobby enough to prevent private ownership of fully autonomous vehicles as in they would be fleet only cars for a long time
66,putting your privately owned autonomous vehicle into taxi mode while at work to generate income would overload the roads
67,the problem is where are you going to park this vehicle that is what gets people in trouble because you are not the first person who has done this if you dont own any land it means you are always parking on land belonging to someone else xb obviously privately own land would be trespassing but even public property can have policies or even laws to prevent the specific thing you are trying to do xb hell i remember not long ago hearing in the news about people living in mobile homes who the city had it out for and started making it illegal for them to park their mobile homes anywhere its pretty common too xb but if you had somewhere you could legally park as in express permission from the land owner you might be alright for the most part however i would add laws are different everywhere and complicated a van is not considered a residence so you would not have some of the rights you would have for sleeping in a van instead of a house they might just declare it illegal anyway even if it had a bed in there and declare it a form of vagrancy xb ruling bodies are pretty dickish to anyone wanting to live any sort of alternative lifestyle in my experience
68,could you move practices move to a mellow private practice maybe move out to the country and be a rural physician in an underserved community and feel more fulfilling sense of purpose dont invest k in cryptocurrency
69,i predicted they would open it up to public by mid and enlarge the private nda driverless to sq mile covid added a months delay so my prediction seems bullseye
70,fore sure this is a future thing you certainly have to imagine the progression and take some guesses at what it will settle on i think on the optimistic side you could see private rides at mile and shared rides as low as mile realistically it would be mile and mile this is still well below the mile to mile for owning a car today of course you the other big hurdle is getting to scale so you can get to those prices to some degree industry might make this push and run at losses to build scale the other likely case is that consumers that cant handle the large up front costs of a car will jump ship to sdc fleets as they are forced out of their old car by repairs of leases ending imagine being presented with month for you or month for your family for sdc fleet service you other option is to spend k repairing your existing car put k down and month to buy a car or sign a lease for month that you know will end in you forking over k in charges at the end of it like you last one did
71,itll happen as soon as they get enough riders someone will post a video to snapchat first thinking it isnt covered by the nda because its just to a friend i trust and hey snapchat is private and then that friend will extract the video and send it to a wider audience one of whom will send it to the press and then finally someone will put it on youtube
72,they would be allowed to drive on private property like race tracks amateur racing is a thing you know that would not be possible if manual drive vehicles were not allowed to be made or owned vehicles capable of being manually driven even for civilians are not going away which was the claim
73,you are presuming a very elastic demand for personal vehicle ownership when plotted against the decreasing price of taxi services i didnt say anything about demand or market i just said that itd cost as much as owning a car taxis are uncertain you dont know what it is going to look like smell like sound like you dont know how long it will take to arrive or what it will cost for your trip or if one will even be available at all when you need it basically all of these things can be or already have been worked out uber type rating systems have ended dumpy dirty cabs pretty well and thatll be further improved with sdcs google vehicles look new basically at all times uber type cab apps also give you pricing well in advance and w flat per km rates youll pretty much know how much a trip costs without even looking just like you can with your own car availability isnt really an issue either if youre in a city i do think that cabs will take a long time to spread to rural areas for a large number of reasons but car ownership in a city over people should be silly for anyone but the wealthy within the next years taking the driver out of taxis changes nothing except the price of the taxi ride ah well it changes who has control google having power over cars vs cab owners google will certainly reduce prices further and give a very uniform experience like when mcdonalds created fast food and obliterated burger joints or megafarms obliterating tiny farms eliminating the driver cuts the price by rds corporate control cuts it in half or by rd again and increased usage drops prices further once the prices are competitive with the city bus youre talking about serious increases in usage it also creates a smoother safer ride and you dont have to deal with another person you still get privacy so you can sing bad music loudly still or sleep or watch tv without it being weird just like in your own car no conversation is expected and you could comfortably send your child alone in one unlike now no risk of getting scammed unlike now plus sdcs could come in more flavours atm you can get a regular cab a van moving trucks limos or buses with a bigger user base they could add tiny efficient vehicles for person they could have ones with beds ones with big screen tvs ones with vr sets some stocked with a bar or a vending machine and snacks if youre just napping on the way home fromto work then take the tiny seater at th the price of a normal car putting you well below bus prices take a high speed vehicle between cities to cut time if you set up an account then the service could remember your settings too for music and we you want if you live in a rural area and are wealthy you certainly will not use these very often maybe you can buy a bunch of vehicles but if you earn under k and live in the city you probably wont buy your own vehicle in a decade or so from now if you live in a town then maybe that line is more like k or k
74,not private and doesnt go where you want or start where you want
75,yeah human why private space and not public space do you want to be comfortable or something
76,if theyre only test cars why do they need approval at all surely you can drive whatever you want on a private closed track
77,the commercial industry will primarily be the first adopters as trucking and cabs seek higher profits by running driver less vehicles which is still a change decades away because they will have workers to displace and regulations to fight id say years away from widespread private ownership as cars circulate in used car markets for about years until they become classics and even then not all models are ever widely collected
78,theres never going to be widespread private ownership by the time something without a steering wheel is road legal why would you own something horribly expensive that would just sit around of the time when a subscription will be just as readily available at a fraction of the cost
79,because other people are disgusting and i dont want them in my private spaces if i dont have to because i want to be able to leave stuff in my car without completely emptying it every single time because i dont want to wait for a car to come pick me up i want to leave right now
80,too lazy to read the article is it about vandalism theft and the like because ive been thinking about that a lot more thieves may target self driving cars because they perceive it to be a victimless crime edit i mean the robotaxis that arent owned by a private citizen
81,tesla announced robotaxi will not be intended for private ownership
82,i know i should have specified i meant only the robotaxis that arent privately owned
83,holy shit the ignorance in this thread is off the charts this is a private beta with only a handful of users and the fix was made the same day edit the fix was made minutes after release you people are just toxic misinformation spreaders
84,how is it private if its on public roads
85,if theres anybody else on the roads near those people then its not a private beta if i was driving on the highway that night and the tesla in front of me suddenly slammed on the brakes that testing affects me even though i didnt opt in
86,this is a private beta its not though
87,if teslas were driven only on private roads i wouldnt care but they are driven on public road just because tesla ownersdrivers consent to this beta test doesnt mean other drivers pedestrians cyclists etc have consented imagine if a private company tried to beta test a cure for cancer but in the process every member of the public is an unwitting participant in their clinical trials
88,private beta means a select number of people can use it it doesnt mean they arent allowed to use it on public roads
89,on public roads for min across hundreds of cars nationwide many of whom might not have been driving during those min extremely private
90,this is nonsense do you freak out when someone is using cruise control do you even understand how the fsd works it requires the driver to pay attention with their hands touching the wheel at all times private beta means only a select group of people are allowed to use it how the hell are you supposed to test self driving feature on a private road the software issue was fixed the same day this entire story is a nothingburger
91,it literally is this isnt opinion covid is real trump lost a private beta used by a few thousand users is a private beta public betas are open to the public this isnt that feel free to invent a new word for it if youd like but this is literally what private beta actually means full stop
92,tesla sent invitations to some drivers for its new experimental driver assistance software dubbed full self driving beta which includes early access to features like autosteer on city streets to get access to fsd beta in general drivers must own tesla vehicles with newer hardware and must purchase or subscribe to the premium fsd package which costs up front in the us or a month sounds private to me invitation only and must have already purchased the premium fsd package edit formatting
93,the problem is that you cant really train an ai like this by playing it safe if all it is trained on is private roads where nothing ever goes wrong then it will fail the first time it encounters something outside of spec technological progress has always required breaking a few eggs if you want to make an omelet
94,would you rather be on the road with a properly licensed regulated responsible driver who is not just half assed tested once in his entire life back in the teen years and in a society where we dont pressure people into driving when tired and give people ample cheap public transportation and remove unfair stigmas against it so they can use alternate transportation when needed or let technology we dont even trust to run our dumb little phones correctly do something as important and mission critical as drive a car something that not only can potentially endanger the passenger but people in other cars and property around them regulation and change has to happen technology isnt the solution to everything since technology isnt perfect and can potentially be far more dangerous than a distracted driver our over reliance on technology has gotten us into a world full of anti privacy and anti freedom as well as so many other things that has dehumanized us to a point where we are essentially a slave to it technology has to be a tool not a means to an end we cannot allow automated driving to exist as it would cause so many more issues than it would solve as well as further erode privacy and freedom yes humans driving are problematic but solving that issue by doing common sense things to help our society eliminate a large number of these problems is a far better solution than further enslaving ourselves to repressive big brother technology im a lifelong sysadmin and programmer ask anyone like me and theyll say the same dont let technology run our lives its not anti technology its anti control and technology isnt reliable or secure enough in any situation to allow it bugs and hacks will happen and theres no way to safeguard it
95,no other car company is making self driving cars at this level this was a private beta for only a small number of drivers edit these downvotes are hilarious this entire thread is just a cesspool of ignorance and hatred it really doesnt reflect well on this sub this isnt even a matter of opinion tesla is measurably demonstrably further along in the path to fsd than any other car manufacturer it isnt even close and if anyone here understood what tesla was actually doing theyd realize how fucked other auto makers are
96,is this your first day the sec barely made a dent after his taking tesla private and tesla stock price too high comments those are the feds right
97,i know what beta means i know what private means when the failure of your product involves death of someone not involved in the beta i would not be calling that private beta thats public beta it doesnt mean they arent allowed to use it on public roads so its public
98,but its a good question its not exactly just a private beta when youre talking about a vehicle driven on public roads even if it were fixed within mins a lot can happen in seconds especially if it were driving on a highway this had the potential to be a much bigger disaster than it was and that shouldnt just be brushed off
99,do they test it on a private road
100,figure out a way simulations private roads and facilities or dont get into this market at all
101,thats simply not true if you sell your car privately fsd and any other software packages you have are carried over to the next owner edit amazing that im downvoted for telling the truth must be some bots in this thread proof full self driving fsd transfer when you sell a tesla
102,good info thanks id still prefer an external auditor to ensure that the process in place is actually safe and that tesla is actually adhering to the steps every time theres a release but i dont care if its a government audit or a third party private auditor as long as they are able to verify it
103,if someone is theoretically pro automated driving but anti real world testing theyre not pro automated driving theyre also ignorant of how machine learning works if we trained cars on private roads our models would know how to drive on private roads we want our models to know how to drive in the real world
104,who died and yes that would still be a private beta because thats how the terminology works if i have a private beta on my phone and walk outside it doesnt suddenly become a public beta if it was a public beta then all tesla owners would have it and that would be significantly worse
105,no thats not how software works private means only a small select group of people have it youre making a huge deal out of nothing
106,lol thats not how publicprivate beta definitions work think of video games which commonly have openpublic and closedprivate betas to test servers
107,such that no one was ever injuredkilled probably very few incidents happen but that doesnt mean products like space heaters washing machines train engines and whatnot werent initially tested as much as possible inside a lab before deploying them on a large scale im not arguing vs having a couple of beta testers on the roads with safety glasses on here im arguing regular consumers shouldnt be enrolled in self driving software betas without being employed in some way by the company to do so and having done some specific safety training like if this was the new call of duty beta on the road want to test these cars hire some damn qa people to do so in simulations then in private roads and then on public roads and keep doing that until you dont consider that a beta at all at that point some incidents may yet happen and that is okay no tech is perfect
108,buying a used car from a dealership who bought from tesla who bought from a person is very different from buying a used car from a person directly thats why i specifically mentioned if you sell your car privately fsd and any other software packages you have are carried over to the next owner if tesla themselves are the next owner they can do anything with the car and remove fsd if they want but if they remove fsd and try to resell it theyll struggle to compete with used car dealerships and private party sales so they would probably avoid doing that
109,yes the first portion i quoted was from under the private sales heading its rare but they can still block it what the second quoted means is that even if fsd transfers from dealership to nd owner they can still take it away from the rd owner after a private sale if the car has ever been at a dealership you are at risk of it being taken away
110,it looks like you shared an amp link these should load faster but googles amp is controversial because of concerns over privacy and the open web you might want to visit the canonical page instead tesla autopilot statistics show its almost as safe driving with it as without tesla autopilot statistics show its almost as safe driving with it as without im a bot why about summon me with uamputatorbot
111,youre getting downvoted for saying this technology allows something that couldnt happen before when there are in fact a multitude of methods by which you can already be tracked self driving cars dont really introduce any new privacy threats
112,privacy is so th century
113,it opens the door to total access and companies dont want to be know for giving your info to the govt cars will not be owned by the govt so theyll have to ask for the info you need to stop spreading the idea that the private sector isnt fully cooperating with the govt to hand over your data a lot of big companies have been outed to have worked with the nsa during the prism program eg microsoft google facebook yahoo and while it has affected their reputation people largely dont change government also is known to have secret ties with plenty of private sector companies that are seemingly innocent so that idea that the govt doesnt have your data is a joke
114,it may not matter but sometimes someone just wants some privacy i dont care if people saw me go to the grocery store i do care if i am tracked on my way to and from the store though i know thats unavoidable with my phone in my pocket but still wanting privacy doesnt mean we are doing illegal shit
115,can i have your passwords to the websites you visit please oh you dont want to give those away because theyre private you arent doing anything illegal though so just give me your passwords then you said you dont care so let me see what youre watching on netflix and what youre ordering from amazon if you really dont care whats that you dont want to give me your passwords you must care about your privacy even though you havent done anything wrong right if you think its okay to keep your passwords private but nothing else then you are not only missing the point of privacy youre just flat out ignoring it
116,can i have your passwords to the websites you visit please oh you dont want to give those away because theyre private you arent doing anything illegal though so just give me your passwords then you said you dont care so let me see what youre watching on netflix and what youre ordering from amazon if you really dont care whats that you dont want to give me your passwords you must care about your privacy even though you havent done anything wrong right if you think its okay to keep your passwords private but nothing else then you are not only missing the point of privacy youre just flat out ignoring it
117,and not sure what you are meaning but can i have your passwords still since people dont care about your supposed privacy you cant really say you dont care about privacy if you are unwilling to give your passwords out there is no pick and choose here you are either for privacy or you arent dont say you dont care about privacy and then say your passwords are private thats not how privacy worksat least thats not how its supposed to work
118,and not sure what you are meaning but can i have your passwords still since people dont care about your supposed privacy you cant really say you dont care about privacy if you are unwilling to give your passwords out there is no pick and choose here you are either for privacy or you arent dont say you dont care about privacy and then say your passwords are private thats not how privacy worksat least thats not how its supposed to work
119,is you being allowed to drive your antique car really worth hundreds of thousands of lives think of the children drive your antique car on a private road or track you have no inherent right to drive on public roads
120,i think these have great potential for carshare providers like zipcar in the not too distant term right now zipcar service typically only pencils out in the densest parts of an urban area imagine instead a zipcar that can drive itself a short distance to be where you reserved it and as more people move to an on demand model of car ownership that will mean people can start thinking of cars less as an all you can eat buffet and more like a pay as you go service those people who can move to this model will save gobs of money personally and save some of the broader social costs of everyone owning private vehicles acceptance of more exotic applications like the robotic taxicab will come later the carshare model still allows people to be in control while they are in the vehicle once people see that their reserved vehicle shows up unscathed maybe acceptance for the taxi model will happen quickly quick side note taxi drivers often pay enormous amounts over k in some areas http for their license to operate be prepared for these individuals to flip their shit if they start competing head to head with google more likely is that the taxi industry will start lobbying hard
121,are you saying that they dont use the same rules for counting manual and autopilot accidents according to their safety report methodology listed on the bottom of their safety report page methodology we collect the amount of miles traveled by each vehicle with autopilot active or in manual driving based on available data we receive from the fleet and do so without identifying specific vehicles to protect privacy we also receive a crash alert anytime a crash is reported to us from the fleet which may include data about whether autopilot was active at the time of impact to ensure our statistics are conservative we count any crash in which autopilot was deactivated within seconds before impact and we count all crashes in which the incident alert indicated an airbag or other active restraint deployed our crash statistics are not based on sample data sets or estimates in practice this correlates to nearly any crash at about mph kph or above depending on the crash forces generated on the other hand police reported crashes from government databases are notoriously under reported by some estimates as much as in large part because most minor crashes like fender benders are not investigated we also do not differentiate based on the type of crash or fault for example more than of all autopilot crashes occur when the tesla vehicle is rear ended by another vehicle in this way we are confident that the statistics we share unquestionably show the benefits of autopilot there isnt a differentiation between the manual or autopilot methodology in here so its very apples to apples
122,accident rates are mostly a red herring fully autonomous self driving will never happen without the us government putting up enough money on road infrastructure to effectively turn roads into railroads all the rhetoric about accident rates or precision is a way to enforce this completely false notion of technological inevitability so that car companies can appropriate more public subsidies for private gain its actually very similar to how the development of counterforce nuclear strategy and therefore nuclear armament escalation hinged on the supposed inevitability of missile precision improvements which would not have been developed without the political decision to develop the arsenal for counterforce in the first place
123,i dont think it should be run by private entities for profit and that model legally supported and enforced on the public
124,its legally needed so a base government level national insurance should cover the absolute basics the private entitys take over the additional extras courtesy cars private rehab and physio theft and damage government level just to cover health private for private needs and property
125,if the automaker is going to accept responsibility you can bet your ass that every time bug splats on an optic the car will pull over and demand maintenance and refuse to drive in rainsnowfog along the same lines the car will almost certainly require the driver to complete a pre flight checklist like an aircraft before departing tree sap bird droppings dust yard clippings and all kinds of things will interfere with the various sensors while the car sits in your driveway or parking lot or parking garage ive always wondered how that would shake out for privately owned sdcs your car which is full of your personal belongings and bags from other stores drops you off at the grocery store and goes to find a parking spot after youre done shopping for groceries you summon the car with your cell phone or whatever but you get a text message back that says sorry a bird shit on the lidar im miles away good luck kthxbye or you get in to the car in the morning to go to work and it says sorry the sensors are blocked by debris so you get out and wipe everything down and get back in and it still says sorry the sensors are blocked by debris so you go back inside and get some cleaning supplies and properly clean everything and the car still says sorry the sensors are blocked by debris meanwhile your kids are late for school your boss is calling you and youre ready to punch the lidar right in the lens
126,i carry tools survival essentials extra change of clothes blanket water food lighters matches knives rope etc two laptops work and personal and all kinds of stuff in my car at any given time i have various posters books and other work materials in the trunk i also keepuhhhhother fun things in there rather than carrying it around on my person theres no way i would give up private ownership of my vehicles in the case i described about being stranded at the grocery store with melting ice cream i would probably ring up a public fleet vehicle to take me to my car so that i could clean it off that however is extremely inconvenient and unnecessarily expensive especially if i already own a car
127,the problem ive always seen is that i think most or possibly all due to legal requirements privately owned early sdcs are likely to have a manual drive mode i find it unlikely automakers are going to insure people driving themselves that would mean if the makers insure the autonomous driving then you have to have two separate insurance policies and that just seems undesirable but at the end of the day i really do think we spend way too much time discussing this issue the cars will be insured one way or another the end user is going to be paying for it at the end of the day if the manufacturers are going to be the actual provider of the insurance great i guess but its one of the least interesting issues to talk about imo
