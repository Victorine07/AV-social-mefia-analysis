0,evacuated tube transport ett st century of the railroad and similar expansion and growth just like the s railroad new york to bejing in two hours moving people and products faster than anything else weve seen newatlascomet vacuum maglev train
1,its really hard to convince people to raise taxes on themselves and remove road space when the only mode of transportation is cars i think sdcs could be a tool for making that happen if we can get fares into separate compartments of one vehicle and subsidize trips tofrom transit stations we might actually be able to make transit convenient enough for people to use it which means we can more easily convince people to vote for it
2,no a bus route is designed to carry a lot of people in a continuous loop usually travelling in an efficient cycle through heavily populated areas any mass transportation would be a better overall solution than self driving cars what i mean here is basically lets bring the person to the ads so for example you get a cab ride home but the cab goes slightly off what would be the most direct route to take you past walmart during youre ride you see an ad in the in car mounted screen advertising walmart products that youve recently viewed on your phone the ad explains that you can order the products now pay for them with paypal and the car will be at the walmart pickup lane in xx number of minutes or lets say you only have a basic subscription and the car takes you on the longer more congested route home from work so the premium customers can have a clearer and faster ride home on the straight route it takes you on a stroad that is lined with retail businesses restaurants and a traffic light every feet so youre face timing the retailers ever had hulu and had to enjoy an advertising experience before you could watch your show that could be your morning routine before the car will leave your driveway
3,i think once autonomous cars are the norm the majority of accidents will be caused by people being demonstrably bad drivers doing the wrong thing on the road so the automated car couldnt react safely and once that happens i think thered be a strong public safety argument to do such a ban im honestly not sure if id support it but i can see that the argument would reasonably exist
4,my concern is cost even if ai gets perfected to the point that autonomous driving is demonstrably safer than humans tomorrow how much would that feature add to the cost of a car how long before you can get an old beater with ai will it even be something you can merely buy once or will it end up as so many things are as a costly subscription as much as id love a self driving car and as much as it would make the roads safer if everybody had one there are lots of people who will never be able to afford a new dumb car let alone a smart one the requisite hardware for autonomous driving would not only have to be good and reliable and safe it would also have to get cheap enough that it doesnt price entry level buyers out of the new car market and will have to be around long enough that there are plenty of old cheap autonomous cars available for those who cant afford new at a guess id say youd need to wait about years after autonomous cars became mainstream before even thinking about legislation even then youd have to start with merely requiring the feature for new model years like we did for backup cameras a few years ago maybe another decade after that you could start financially disincentivizing human driven cars insurance surcharges and whatnot in the end i dont think youll ever need to ban them theyll just become too old and too expensive for any but hardcore enthusiasts to bother keeping years after ai driving becomes a standard feature cars without the feature will be years old think about cars that are years old now would you want to drive one every day theyre so old that theyre either rusting into the ground or have gone through the old and cheap phase and come out the other side into the realm of expensive classics sooner or later cars without ai will be like cars without fuel injection or abs or air conditioning theyll exist but theyll all have historic plates and theyll only get driven to car shows
5,i would support them being treated like go karts or atvs there are plenty of places you can drive them legally your own back yards specified tracks etc but not typically on most roads
6,at some point yes computers are just better than humans at some tasks currently theyre not but they will be and once all cars are autonomous thered be great efficiency gains in terms of traffic much of traffic is caused by human behavior such as braking too hard or lane changing too much which causes ripple effects that caused large slow downs autonomous cars can be connected to a network which controls how each individual car behaves and theyd all drive optimally for the good of all on private roads let people do whatever they want but in public no
7,as long as i can take my uncles red barchetta out for an occasional spin on country roads im cool with it city driving is for the machines
8,this is a delicate question it depends on a lot of factors there would be vast differences in attitudes between urban suburban and rural drivers their access to public transport would be vastly different as well and their access to features such as wireless charging accident avoidance infrastructure communication vehicle to vehicle for example would all be different based on whats available also there is a major set of people who enjoy driving this could continue via private roads though which would mostly be a large improvement in liability and safety driving could be a dedicated hobby which may prove out to be excellent compared to today
9,i think the main issue is that when we have a blend of non autonomous and autonomous cars sharing the same roads autonomous cars are going to get bullied like crazy people are going to recognize that they can cut them off and they will yield every time because their programming insists on them being safe this will piss off the owners of autonomous vehicles and eventually lead to the exclusion of non autonomous vehicles from certain roads likely federal interstates first
10,no i like being able to see something cool and just decide to turn off the main road cant really do that when google maps is the driver and navigator
11,i could see it coming to certain types of roads must be robot only driving but thats really only going to be major freeways and the whole la region thats a joke a bit smaller suburban roads or rural routes would still remain open to human driving i think they did this in the movie minority report with tom cruise
12,would you support banning non autonomous vehicles from public roads in the future yes once they reach a supermajority of vehicles on the road
13,thats a ridiculous concept i cant imagine autonomous vehicles ever reaching such a level i would support banning them from public roads for the time being
14,think about all the things required to make a car street legal blinkers reflectors bumper height mirrors size shape etc all to reduce road deaths when we have the holy grail of reducing road deaths you better believe we are going to go for it driving a car recreationally can still exist in the same way that riding a horse does just not on i
15,exactly but the cross over period were entering it now where autonomous vehicles and driven cars share the road im wondering how long that will last i imagine once the tech is good enough and new cars start to come with self driving features itll just be a matter of years i could imagine autonomous vehicles by and then by it being very rare to see someone driving or people just driving for fun im probably off on my timeline but curious what others foresee
16,i cant believe i had to scroll so far for weather to be mentioned these cars rely on sensors right what sensor is not going to be affected by a foot of snow on the ground ice build up or salt corrosion i dont think well ever have all roads upgraded to be compatible at all times with all self driving vehicles
17,if self driving cars do become the norm which i do not think will happen in our life time human operated vehicles will eventually have to die out because the human makes an exponential amount of errors relative to a self driving car the reason i do not think it will happen soon is because for there to be any sense of autonomous driving on the current system of roads there needs to be a minimum uniform code in the algorithm such that cars of different makes can communicate with each other say for example two cars traveling in opposite directions meet across from each other in an intersection and both want to turn east when humans operate vehicles this is easy because its just plain human interaction on the other hand if these cars are self driving both cars need to know when where and at what speed the other car is going to make the east turn why because if they dont they will go at the same time and hit each other trying to make the east turn at the same time this is a fundamental problem transitioning to an autonomous transportation system and i dont think private car manufacturers will be open to sharing their autonomous driving code with each other so in short i dont think you have to worry about existing in a world where you will be forced to adopt an autonomous driving vehicle
18,im sure it varies by state but here in michigan its perfectly acceptable to ride a horse on a public road and be treated as a vehicle for all intents and purposes i could reasonably ride wherever i want michigan vehicle code excerpt riding animal or driving animal drawn vehicle on roadway rights and duties sec a person riding an animal or driving an animal drawn vehicle upon a roadway shall be granted all of the rights and shall be subject to all the duties criminal penalties and civil sanctions applicable to the driver of a vehicle by this chapter except those provisions of this chapter which by their very nature may not have application
19,moreover i actually like to drive not on the busy highways mind you and id probably take the autonomous public option then but a lot of county and state public roads can be fun to drive dont take that freedom away please
20,what about the freedom of someone to drive a car they can fix themselves id imagine a lot of technology in self driving cars is proprietary and would stop people from having the ability to take personal responsibility of their own property or even have the liberty to use it on public roads
21,im not an actuary so i dont know the answer to that question theres also the school of thought that believes that a sharp spike sticking out of the steering wheel is a better road safety mechanism than seatbelts so maybe your spike thing should not only be allowed but encouraged
22,thats a fair point to raise but its still an arbitrary point to place a line in the sand it has less to do with legal freedom but most people already have no freedom mentally or physically to cross the sea most have to rely upon technology or professionals to make that trip why draw the line there on how farwhere you can travel without the reliance on others the easiest place to draw the line truly is with walkingbiking if you have the need to travel great distances thats going to require some level of sacrifice no matter how you look at it also more specifically addressing your concern we already do not have the liberty to use any old vehicle on public roads in many places it has to meet certain standards and its tested periodically according to those standards emissions safety etc a transition to autonomous is just one additional rung up the ladder you might not be okay with that but to me its very arbitrary and i disagree that its a concern for the losses that well experience we will gain just as many benefits with a transition to autonomous
23,my point is we have govt regulations that specify how high a bumper should be so that suvs dont just crush smaller cars in accidents and thats a really good thing if we have a path to reduce road deaths even further we should take it my right to not die is more important than your right to drive recreationally on major highways or city streets
24,you make good points another concern i would have generally is that it continues the idea of prioritising cars autonomous or not on public roads particularly in cities because if banning non autonomous cars of the road also meant separating the road from pedestrians and other non autonomous traffic motorbikes bikes scooters etc than i would have a problem with it at least in cities highways are different for obvious reasons
25,because if banning non autonomous cars of the road also meant separating the road from pedestrians and other non autonomous traffic motorbikes bikes scooters etc than i would have a problem with it i think if anything the autonomous vehicles programming would preclude it from operating in a manner dangerous to pedestrians and cyclists i could enter a crosswalk with the right of way and not have to worry about whether approaching cars would stop i know they would
26,i mean fundamentally a car is a way to get from a to b we accept how dangerous they are perhaps wrongly because for most americans there is not a comparably convenient way to do this that doesnt impose the same external costs but were being asked to consider a hypothetical future where there is such an alternative once you strip that away youre left with a hobby really more of a fetish actually your fetish is fine if it only harms you but cars endanger other road users as well drivers passengers cyclists and pedestrians its basically like smoking in restaurants its not allowed anymore in most of the country because as much as smokers enjoy it the cost it imposes on others isnt justified all this is round about way of saying cars are objectively dangerous to the extent its justified at all the danger is justified as a fact of life because for better or worse people rely on them to survive but if were being asked to accept it just because people like driving then thats frankly pretty sick
27,theoretically yes but in practice making sure an autonomous car is safe to people around it on its own is impossible the variables are simply too large this is why im saying it would worry me to only allow autonomous cars on the road because the only way to make it safe is to bannot allowed pedestrians access to the road other than specified crossing points and to ban non autonomous traffic too bye bye cyclists i was watching a video about how jaywalking was invented by the auto industry as a way to sell safer roads when in reality it was setting the car at the top of the highway hierarchy by stopping pedestrians getting in the way and creating car centric urban planning policy particularly in cities it makes zero sense to privilege autonomous cars on the road and on a tangent i dont think cars electric andor autonomous will be the solution to traffic or climate change in the future mass transit and public transport is much better at solving those problems
28,theoretically yes but in practice making sure an autonomous car is safe to people around it on its own is impossible the variables are simply too large this is why im saying it would worry me to only allow autonomous cars on the road because the only way to make it safe is to bannot allowed pedestrians access to the road other than specified crossing points and to ban non autonomous traffic too bye bye cyclists are non autonomous cars safe to people around them i was watching a video about how jaywalking was invented by the auto industry as a way to sell safer roads when in reality it was setting the car at the top of the highway hierarchy by stopping pedestrians getting in the way and creating car centric urban planning policy i think honestly autonomous cars would have to be either as a matter of policy or just as a risk aversion measure on the part of the manufacturers programmed to yield by default and on a tangent i dont think cars electric andor autonomous will be the solution to traffic or climate change in the future mass transit and public transport is much better at solving those problems hard agree but a car free future would require bulldozing most of the uss built environment as we know it were not there yet
29,no one is forcing you to hop inside an automated car no one is forcing you to walk near roads and active streets
30,yeah just like we require drivers to pass a written and driving test have requirements for registered smog checked vehicles which must abide by the rules of the road there are plenty of requirements we have in place to allow people the freedom to drive im not talking about throwing drunk year olds behind a wheel
31,i dont know if it will be a small minority of people judging by the replies in this thread i enjoy throwing axes i dont throw them in public because theyre dangerous if they hit someone instead i go to a range where i can throw them in a safe environment it still isnt safe but its in an out of the way place where everyone consented to be im sure in there will be hobbyist courses where people can enjoy the thrill of the open road just as long as back here in my neighborhood cars always yield at crosswalks not just some of the time when their owners are feeling generous
32,manufactures will do everything possible to avoid this responsibility including encouraging only autonomous vehicles on the roads to make it peoples responsibility if they get hit rather than the manufactures
33,once we get to that point well have a saturation of autonomous cars on the road and should already be working on standards around inter car communication to prevent issues
34,um nope you are confusing automotive radar used for things like adaptive cruise control or emergency braking that uses radio waves with lidar which is a totally different beast and uses light in fact most autonomous cars have both systems lidar is usually the spinning thing inside the turret on the roof eg on the waymo cars most often from velodyne radars are typically mounted behind the front grille or under the front bumper lidar is basically a laser range finder but it spins degrees and scans also up and down so it creates a three dimensional map of the surroundings automotive radar cant do that it is has nowhere near the resolution for it due to the much longer wavelength compared to the infrared laser btw automotive radar interference with g and such is very unlikely both because of narrow band filtering and also because these millimeter wave signals are extremely directional so the automotive signals following the road surface are not going to hit the cell towers
35,i cant think of a scenario where cars are moving at high speeds while surrounded by hundreds of other cars in a traffic jam or parking lot the lidar could just be set to sample less frequently and thus reduce overlap you can also use polarization and patterned pulses of light to reduce the issue though of course the best way to prevent this is to have fewer cars on the roads
36,basically we are really good at detecting very small changes in frequency you have a conceptually similar problem if you have a hundred people in the same room all browsing the internet on their iphones in comparison having a few cars near each other on the road is a relatively minor problem and can actually be beneficial if the cars can share information with each other they become a distributed sensor network and actually provide better performance the more cars you have
37,ive taken a few classes on aircraft radar couldnt you also change the frequency mid broadcast tweet it steadily higher like a bird for example i know the newer aesa radars will do that to help combat certain forms of ew but if you randomly chose a place within your broadcast to tweet the frequency and have that saved off for the signal processing on the receiving end the odds for a single broadcast overlapping on both tricks becomes crazy small
38,if you have say khz of bandwidth that you can split into hz steps thats frequencies if you randomly hop between them the chances that another sensor will happen to intersect for say consecutive transmission periods becomes tiny i dont think this is quite correct although the odds of the same signal successively interfering with you are low you need to calculate based on any signal interfering with you if youre in a high traffic area there might be say cars near enough to you to interfere if every one of them broadcasts a radar signal in your bandwidth theres a very high chance that each signal will be interfered with even over five or ten successive signals i suppose the numbers here are made up so i dont know what the actual math comes out to but large bi directional traffic jams on large highways or parking lot exits after major events will have very high densities of cars
39,that would give you a decent background on bandwidth and modulation schemes and things of that nature which are critical for understanding this but to get into signals stuff specific to radar would also require a class on rf radio frequency but really its shorthand for radio communications and broadcast and probably still more directly focusing on radar its a good start though
40,yes if the cars are sharing data then cars could react to things they cant yet sense going around a corner a lead car or a car coming from another direction could detect an animal in the road and tell the cars behind it to slow down maybe there are changing road conditions like a puddle mudslide ice etc this would not only make other self driving cars safer but it would potentially give human drivers more time to react leading to fewer secondary accidents pileups also as of last year googles car used lidar for small details which has problems in the rain snow so a car might not be able to accurately sense the road conditions until the traction control system tells the car about it which doesnt happen until the tires actually drive over the surface synced cars would make them all safer by giving them more data to base their decisions on
41,i suppose a person could make that argument however when there are more autonomous cars on the road than regular drivers which seems to be the direction some would like to see it head security of these systems would seem to be a legitimate concern in any case the question had little to do with what people were willing to pay for and more to do with how the system is impacted if at all when someone tries
42,thats called vv vehicle to vehicle you would announce your velocity and gps position to other vehicles too starting to show up but it theres a fundamental limitation it only helps if the other car has it too even if of the the cars on the road were able to talk this way youd still need to be able to handle the other somehow thats why theres continuous rumors that governments are going to force vv if everybody adopted it simultaneously it would work youd have to accommodate old cars for some years but maybe you could retrofit them minimally
43,are you an engineer at honda or just an employee i have two questions about their safety features in the touring cr v that i was really curious about but i dont think theyd answer it if i asked someone officially specifically with the adaptive cruise control lane keeping assist system could you basically jump on a straight road hit the cruise and let go and the car will keep you going if nothing interferes the other question was just something i dont have the guts to test will adaptive cruise control stop the car if it approaches a barrier or does it go down to the mph that cruise stops working and just cut out
44,tesla rolled out a fully automatic prototype i believe heard it on rt podcast but assuming the waves used for this echolocation are easily recreatable a homemade device could just be emitting random signals you probably wouldnt be able to easily lock a car signal so the interference would be intermittent that said on a short enough list of frequencies it can cycle quick enough to block out say of what the car can read that means at a stoplight maybe a quarter of those cars get effected and will be recycling frequency if the blocker keeps cycling the only real limit is keeping the signal on long enough to tell the car they cant use it i assume itll ignore a few milliseconds of interference and the odds of collision are also very slim especially since it is required they have manual controls in most cases the mesh network system that will link all cars location can also probably be jammed not cheaply i assume but might make my whole idea moot for all i know i dont know how they plan to pull that off but if its not a satellite link and just lan you can probably mess with that channel too same device several signals now realistically a cheap build you could still probably get several frequencies covered at once that wont be directionally broadcasted without a wide array of points and geometry and even so if you had it in a car or something the likelihood of being mathematically pinpointed as the source is slim and i doubt a detective would find you prosecutable before manufacturers find a workaround you can download to these fancy whips if a manhole was open and letting out hot air nearby pressure changes could change who could be the culprit hacking would require a connection that the car trusts i believe they built the dlc interface to not really do anything except check teslacom for news and updates its pretty locked down and requires approval from the driver forcing a connection installation and hardware control while driving doesnt seem practical finally i know this isnt perfect not really fleshed out im pretty certain this wont actually happen someone with a six figure salary is in charge of that but it is scary to think that a driverless car will allow someone totally asleep to be driving along unable to react if the machine is compromised
45,im a tech at the service center in marysville yes the car will keep itself in the lane on a straight road if you dont have your hands on the wheel for more than sec it will beep at you if you continue to keep your hands off the wheel it will suspend the lane keep assist the acc system will bring the car down to mph with the brakes but will then cancel below that speedacura has low speed follow the collision mitigation braking system will help lower the severity of a crash but it wont prevent it if the cmb system has to step in youre going to hit something
46,so do the lidars currently deployed already do this phase sensitive detection or is this another step that will be needed before a fleet of cars can share the road
47,so this is actually one of the top reasons that we should move to driverless cars the problem with driverless cars isnt really the road and how to stay in the lane and how to make turns its more about how to predict cars with human drivers which can sometimes behave erratically for instance if you had driverless cars all communicating with eachother they would all know what the other cars are doing at any point in time this also means that since they share the same set of rules they can even predict how other cars will behave imagine its rush hour and suddenly a rock falls onto the road or something how does that react with human drivers the first person hits their brakes when they see the rock then person two hits their brakes when they see the brake lights then three when they see person twos brake lights you have several things slowing down this process driver reaction times mechanical slowness moving the foot to the brake for multiple drivers in a driverless car scenario the first car would spot the rock and signal to the cars behind them wirelessly that there is a blockage and they could all slam on their brakes at the same time without having to wait to see brakelights in more extreme cases the cars on either side of the first car could slam on their brakes to make room for the initial car to swerve and avoid the object something that would be impossible for a human to do on the other hand imagine a red light turning green car starts rolling then car starts rolling then car etc in a driverless world all the cars would start rolling at the same time in rush hour all the cars could be more tightly packed together because they dont need to leave as much room between cars to account for reaction times to get back to your question driverless cars communicating in eachother and working cooperatively has always been in the plan wireless communications work on a completely different frequency than lasers and other distancessonar type measurement tools wireless networks these days can already hand hundreds and thousands of users so you wouldnt have to worry about the car computers talking over eachother
48,they share the same set of rules they can even predict how other cars will behave this is most important part right now our ability to coordinate with other drivers without being able to communicate is based on humans understanding and following traffic protocols i dont know exact numbers but i would suspect that upwards of of all traffic accidents are a result of humans failing to properly follow these protocols passing on the right going too fast following too closely etc at issue is that humans are greedy buggers who are only concerned with personal short term consequences so these protocols are often treated more like suggestions people generally dont care that rapidly changing lanes without signalling reduces the total throughput of the highway by x just that they are late to their dentist appointment imagine if airline pilots or train conductors thought the same way once we eliminate human drivers from the road entirely lots of these issues just go away a computer will never decide that it is ok to drive slowly in the left lane or roll through a stop sign it will follow the protocols put into place exactly as they were intended to be followed and traffic fatalities could drop into the hundred or dozens
49,encryption is always an option they already have this kind of stuff for your remote for your car to unlock the door its encrypted in some way im not an expert in that but i do know there have been some security issues with thieves being able to transmit the signal to open your car and it opens no alarms no nothing to answer your question theres nothing stopping people from sending false signals but whether or not the car interprets them as real and reacts to them is a different story imagine a hacker were to be driving down the road and decide to recant the rock falling whats stopping him from saying theres a rock infront of me everyone behind me stop immediately they take that instruction as truth and act accordingly the car systems have to be built with security that isnt really feasible yet you have to protect the communications easy we do this all the time and the communications encryption method you also have to protect the hardware in from way from being tampered with in a way that could send false signals its very complicated and wont be an easy hurdle to overcome
50,dsrc devices dedicated short range communications are radios placed in cars and in larger rsus roadside units which adhere to the p spec and are licensed to transmit in the mhz frequency band
51,not really driving on the wrong side of the road to begin with shouldnt be driving at all just an administrativelegal problem relating to licensing
52,we dont need cycle lanes everywhere bikes are allowed on roads well theyre not going to integrate into this automated car network very well edit spelling
53,that is a simulation of a lane road
54,im a traffic engineer capacity for roadways work under a build it and they will come mentality for instance when you widen a highway from two to three lanes it is only a matter of time before the need for a fourth lane presents itself because traffic has increased point is all this is doing is essentially adding capacity to the intersection it is only a matter of time before this just doesnt work because there are too many cars on the road and you run out of space for more lanes
55,in my college town we had a road like that had to use tunnels it wasnt very fun during bad weather knee deep in rainsnowhomeless people
56,dont worry they will have a dark half flooded tunnel under the road for you try not to get stabbed in
57,a bridge that connects each side of the road might help but they wont do that cause the government doesnt give a
58,ill get downvoted to shit but oh well i got a friend that does his masters degree on self driving tech and weve talked about it a fair bit short awnser not only will you be able to cross the road but youll be able to do so whenever you feel like it long awnser self driving cars wont just react to outside stimuli theyll be connected with each other through g connectivity updating their positions and statuses thousands of times per secondand they wont just connect with each other but with the road as well the big picture is that there will be a system that will either automatically or manually manages trafficand since there is such a system that manages all cars at once you can have normal intersectionsin intersectionsin front of the intersection you have a button you press it and the traffic manager simply stops all the cars you pass and when all the cars agree you have passed they start againas againas a pedestrian you dont have to wait for the light to turn greenyou greenyou just press the button and goself driving technology is extremely interesting and will reduce traffic timesand cars will require way less lanesi dont think its wise hating on it tho because you guys at the usa dont have trainsself driving cars and self driving tech isnt your problem your problem is that you dont have trains so allso focus on that xb sincerely a european
59,fly i guess i mean cars are not self driving now and they already expect us to fly over the road sigh
60,the theory for an intersection like that is you just walk across and the vehicles make room for you sure it sounds crazy but if you brought someone from the pre industrial era forward in time and had them cross a busy road today it would scare them
61,in theory the cars could be programmed to all automatically handle a pedestrian in the road so they could just cross whenever and the cars would stop as needed
62,ever heard of an overpass walkway this isnt just a road this is an lane highway intersection lol
63,heres the thing you dont no pedestrian should be near the roads anyway in this situation an overpass or underpass should be used
64,on the right road top lane theres a car that stops for no reason their path is fully clear why stop
65,how am i as a pedestrian supposed to cross this road hypothetically just walk across assuming the laws that have been proposed to disallow asshole mode in self drive vehicles are a success you would be able to just walk into any traffic and all the vehicles would stop to accommodate you i forget where i saw it but some people doing a review of a self drive system tested this literally tried everything they could to get hit or cause a vehicle to choose to unsafely manoeuvre into a pedestrian or cycle and they couldnt in the limited time they had they quickly realised the tables would turn at a certain point where non motorists would dominate the roadways there would be no reason to stay off the roads it would be the safest place because the ai was working the hardest to protect you
66,bridges built over roads
67,thats a lane roadthe better question is when are you ever crossing a lane road
68,thats the neat part you dont cross the road
69,thats not how id imagine a fully self driving car system based on how early the technology id expect the cars to either be equidistant or much tighter packed in few lanes equidistant would make it impossible to transverse a road as cars would seemingly always be pretty close as the tech ages id expect the gaps to shrink and see long and tight lines of cars in fewer lanes to reduce infrastructure cost personally i believe in a car free city model but the way zoning in the us is done i could never see a truly car free society without the need of mass migration i dont see people migrating but if you took the top sized us cities and make them no longer expand in size and fill in the gaps to increase density a car free city would be great would also free up a bunch of land in cities that were previously parking lots would give rural people the ability to travel that is not solvable in mass transit
70,this needs to be roads only never on a street or stroad
71,this road is raised and not for pedestrians people are so small minded fr
72,how about an elevated walkway seems like an area with the population to support a lane road would be able to swing that
73,dont worry no western government would fund that kind of infrastructure i mean look at the state of our roads now
74,elevated sidewalk or sidewalk under the road either way
75,you arent which is why therell be universal road traffic medical cover for everyone not agile enough
76,it doesnt even take a software bug one thing wrong with the road and it all grinds to a halt one patch of black ice that causes an unexpected brake one pothole the algorithm doesnt expect one emergency vehicle coming through the intersection that the algorithm doesnt know how to schedule around one deer darting out into the road one piece of debris one tire bursting etc etc etc theres so many spanners that could get thrown into those works and all it takes is one for the entire thing to turn into a massive pileup if we were going to automate everything into a giant public transit system there are way more efficient and safe solutions than one car per commuter a comprehensive rail network with an automated last mile system for instance you ride the train to the station nearest your destination then you get on a self driving short range rickshaw kind of thing for the last mile connection provided you dont just walk there were so obsessed with future that were creating problems that we dont need to solve all so we can pretend the needlessly complicated solution is the better one because future
77,is this dude often crossing lane roads as a pedestrian
78,actually youre not supposed to cross the road
79,perhaps we can keep the existing roadway and have one giant self driving car that everyone can use along a predetermined route but until we have the technology for it i guess a person can drive this big car
80,there is absolutely no reason for there to be lanes on each road here wtf
81,try walking on the people roads
82,the answer that nobody wants to hear just walk across the road the idea here is that all the vehicles are communicating with each other thats why the model was turned up to the max to show the possibilities of a fully autonomous car system if this is ever a reality the idea is that any obstacle could be easily avoided by these vehicles working together autonomous vehicles are good for pedestrians and cyclists im not sure why this sub is hating on them so much
83,i totally agree with rfuckcars i am a biker but this right here stupid software bug away from death this will have a lot less maybe zero people killed than the drinking idiots out on the road right at this moment so no i do not agree
84,roads are for cars not walking
85,well in america wstroads and no sidewalks theres nothing to worry about thanks notjustbikes
86,yeah try this on indian roads you will definitely see a heap of crashed cars in probably a few mins not to mention cows and dogs jumpng over em
87,youre also one drunk driver away from death one texting driver away from death one distracted driver away from death one speeding to show off driver away from death one road raging driver away from death human drivers kill way more people than computer drivers ever would
88,answer do what asia does and have bridges that go over the fucking road
89,im sorry but where i live its taken them years to add a third lane on an mile stretch of highway through towm how are these lane roads getting built and why would a lane rd ever need a traffic light how many houses and businesses are you destroying to build a surface rd that big in years when construction is complete will we still even be driving cars
90,to be fair tho it could be solved with tunnels and bridges we already do that here on some busy intersections that being said you best believe that you need everyone driving automated or this whole thing falls apart you need the roads to be amazing and the cars to be well maintained which we wont solve without solving poverty first but the ruling class doesnt want that
91,this looks like the road in bee movie
92,i have that issue with roundabouts as well keeps the traffic flowing is great and all but unless there is a light for pedestrians to cross they cant and if there is a light you just lost the benefit of having a roundabout vs a four way stop cars are convenient situationally but building infrastructure to favor them above all other forms of transit is just dumb everybody is a pedestrian at some point in their life even if its just walking from their car across the road to the store not every one drives should be therefore a no brainer to bias infrastructure towards pedestrians and not cars
93,this guy out here trying to cross lane roads somebody get him a therapist
94,im certain this road would be illegal to cross theres no lane road that legal for me to cross around here anyway
95,this is just the average florida road wym
96,when have you ever crossed at a x lane intersection probably never they would build pedestrian bridges over or tunnels under the road or highway
97,you dont there would ideally be a walkway bridge above the road
98,go back in time kill all the auto company executives that were gutting public transportation change the entire course of history when it comes to infrastructure then come back and cross the road otherwise youre going to have to rip up literally this entire country to remake it so that public transport works
99,this is if everyones in a self driving car and the roads in good condition and all the cars are in good repair point is so much has to go right that this is pretty much impossible
100,a footbridge over the road
101,you just get in a car and it crosses the road for you
102,crossy road irl
103,they would stop automatically for you even if it wasnt your turn to cross they do that now and it is awesome they are far better at it than humans sdcs are part of the fewer cars solution they are one of the tools we have to de car our roadscities
104,you know what drives itself while you chill already a fucking train you know what doesnt have to wait for pedestrians or be a danger in spaces that pedestrians are trains you know what never has traffic jams trains you know what we should be spending our resources on instead of more hunks of metal on the road you guessed it trains
105,i know this is a meme but the answer is by not building stroads and by having your pedestriancycling streetspaths separate from your motor vehicle roads
106,i was in malaysia for a weekend they do this without ai and pedestrians just co mingle it was a frightening experience and i avoided crossing the road any chance i got the taxi rides were lit tho
107,if only we had some way to cross roads already like cross walks or pedestrian walkways
108,imagine being a cyclist on this god damn road its even worse
109,lets more away from more roads and more towards trains
110,wow cool what could go wrong and kill a bunch of people cell tower outage power outage lane striping fades road construction someone drives their own car snow flurry falling leaves flat tire person walks or bikes software gets out of date or hacked squirrel chews on a gadget bird poops on a sensor
111,you know what would make this better putting the cars in a guideway so they dont have to deal with tracking their curves and driving themselves now the cars are only having to deal with one axis forward and back to further optimize the design lets separate the crossing streams of traffic so they dont have to stop for each other to reduce waiting time then lets reduce the rolling resistance by putting the cars on steel wheels and on steel rails since they no longer have to quickly stop at the intersection to wait for other cars to further improve the design lets make the cars connect together based on the destinations of people to reduce wind resistance we could even afford to take all the small inefficient engines and put them in the front car as a more efficient larger engine or maybe even create some incredibly futuristic way of powering the cars from a wire above the guideway since this would be a more efficient means of transferring energy i call it the transportation by roadway for an incredibly national network or trainn for short
112,they really wouldnt change the current roads but yeah you could eliminate stop lights and build cross walk bridges over the intersection a lot of intersections already do that around various cities
113,we can just make a bridge above the roads like in animes
114,they act as if cars immediately accelerate to full speed and that every road is lanes wide
115,i saw a video of someone crossing the road in thailand or something that this person would be terrified to see
116,obviously elons boring technology were gonna be under the road the surface is for robotsai not humans
117,as a pedestrian i am more comfortable in front of avs than human drivers fwiw human drivers have already proven total incompetence when it comes to safety on the road avs will be at least able to sense things a human driver will not not saying im in support im just saying there are advantages worth looking at less cars in the road would also be a possibility especially in cities and thus less asphalt wastelands known as parking lots obviously im team fuck cars in general just looking at big picture here becaus avs are inevitable whether we like it or not
118,even more important where the fuck do you have roads with lanes
119,damn i knew the live action remake crisis was crazy but not crossy road too
120,there is something very similar to this much more efficient than a crossroad and doesnt require surveillance of every participant a humble roundabout does a great job and with an island between outgoing and incoming lanes its also faster and less stressing for pedestrians and cyclists
121,the brain chip they are making will help you cross the road automatically just like the cars
122,pretend your playing crossyroad
123,yet we have millions of software bugs humans driving every day no good answers with cars besides making the roads accessable to all did everyone notice in that tweet thread that elon admitted to traffic going up immensely when ai takes the wheel this day was coming all auto makers are spending billions to develop this tech and if you had recognized the trend in auto safety systems ai is just the next logical step to vehicle safety my hope is that more people will value being outside of the car and get enough support to make our public roads equitable to all users this will be independent of whatever cars are doing because the safety standards will be looked at outside of the driver seat and at the most vulnerable peds bikes kids playing unfortunately ill be dead before i see meaningful change in this maybe my kids will enjoy it though
124,roadways designers should never let pedestrians near highways that defeats the entire point proper road hierarchy would limit pedestrians to arterial secondary collector and local roads for safety and proper traffic management
125,you could literally just build cat walks over the roads or under the roads
126,you cross the road by walking over it the only reason this looks dangerous is because humans suck just walk they will wait
127,that is a lane road sir feet of traffic what the fuck is on the other side that you need to get to
128,you will just be able to run out in the intersection assuming there are no human controlled cars cars with automated driving will not be able to hit pedestrians we will rule the road
129,actually this would be a good thing because a lot of traffic and air pollution from cars is caused by idle times which this system would reduce it would be easy to factor in pedestrian road crossings only unlike at a conventional intersection where all the cars perpendicular to the direction of crossing must stop it would be possible to slow and stop the cars near the pedestrian that would cross their path india accomplishes this without technology
130,every vehicle has instant acceleration in this animation what happens with vehicles of various sizes shapes power gearing etc id like to see a working simulation that accounts for those plus all the other real world conditions including road conditions and weather
131,have the sidewalks go over the road at the four corners
132,alright this is gonna be absolutely crazy but what if the cross walk went over the road no no ik thats insane
133,the easiest answer is to have crosswalks that go over the road instead possibly taking up the space the traffic lights would have
134,we will have to make crosswalks under the road but any animal crosses the road and they are goners
135,tunnels under the road would be the best way for pedestrians to get across that
136,github issue closed not in product roadmap s
137,as a poor person who will never have a self driving car how am i in my honda supposed to cross this road
138,over the road
139,i used to travel to texas for work and id stay in hotels i stayed in a hotel once that was mins away from where i worked because it had a kitchen and whole foods was just on the other side of the street it was literally impossible to walk to the whole foods that was just a few hundred feet away i walked for over an hour to find somewhere i could cross with no luck i ended up calling an uber from the side of the road and it still took another mins to get to whole foods self driving cars would be great but what we really need is need public transportation and pedestrianbike friendly roads
140,its not their fault you have had access to games like frogger and crossy road for decades if you didnt build up your skills that is on you s i suppose you will expect someone to come save you during the zombie apocalypse too
141,just build those over the road walkways like they have in in parts of tokyo little annoying walking up stairs but whatever
142,self walking will help you cross a road with self driving cars
143,the self driving cars stop and let you pass hell theyll do that at any point in the road so now you dont even have to go to a cross walk down the road
144,crossy roads irl
145,heres the issue with self driving cars regular drivers are driven by people people with a sense of what theyre doing and where theyre going being able to see things that may not be on the road react accordingly and can practice self defense driving people are also extremely likely to make a mistake far more than a computer is to glitch someone might not be paying attention not get enough sleep not follow the law or simply not care a computer will never feel the need to make any mistakes and will only ever follow its programming a bug is very unlikely to occur and it doesnt even have to be fatal if it does occur problem is unless we were to replace every single vehicle on the road with self driving cars they will never be the investment many believe they are having to design a computer around the human behavior will never be effective enough to justify the cost only a full robust system designed around self driving cars will be the safest and effective system thats why it will never happen either way
146,you dont the road crosses you
147,crossy road irl
148,since we have no clue how cognition ie the abilty to think and reason works in a biological brain we have no ability to create machines that have that ability either deep learning algorithms and neural network software do not and cannot have this ability regardless of how much training data you throw at it a child knows the difference between a real stop sign and a stop sign on someones clothing they also know that a stop sign is still a stop sign even if it has a sticker or some graffitti on it these so called improperly named ais do not know the difference furthermore any so called self driving car that has to randomly pull over to the side of the road and stop then call a remote human operator to guide it manually through whatever it is it cant handle is not in any way shape or form ready to be responsible for the safety of human occupants or be allowed on public roads its all a failed technology that will never be ready for real world use these companies all know this but have invested so much money in the development that they insist on marketing it anyway to recover that money or go bankrupt dont fall for the self driving car meme
149,id love to see this simulation actually run with enough traffic to justify a lane road i think my lane cul de sac sees more cars than this hypothetical intersection
150,i was gonna say something about autonomous trains but then realized thats a bad idea too and not just because im gonna go work for union pacific and dont want my future job taken either before anyone brings it up yes i know about those bullshit container pods which i doubt any railroad would actually invest in
151,easy make cardboard wall slide onto road all traffic stop black dude with wide eyes and spread hands meme
152,bridges over the roads for pedestrians
153,uh realistically they will probably have cross walks will still exist or the much superior over road pedestrian bridge
154,thats an lane roadway why the fuck would you want to cross that thats some i robot shit
155,im new to this sub but i know exactly what they mean it would be so hard to cross that road and resist the advances of all those glistening automobiles edit i may have misunderstood the purpose of this subreddit
156,as a road construction worker please respectful fuck off
157,i mean if possible a simple over pass for pedestrians could work in all but the smallest of settings maybe have a lift instead of stairs so still compliant with various disibility issues this kind of solution would also allow for safer road crossings as well as it keeps cars where cars belong in general and pedestrians where pedestrians belong its safer for both parties cycling poses other design challenges in a setting like this when designed for pedestrian and motor vehicles my post also has questions dealing with weight capacity as well as would this area be offimits to big rig traffic maybe once we reach autonomous driving well have an seperate big rig lane that stays out of the way of regular vehicles and pedestrians
158,at a conference ive been at where this was a proposal the plan is roads would have to be reworked and either tunnels bridges or separate areas for pedestrians would be built with these roads in mind
159,you dont just cross under the road
160,bridge above road
161,self driving cars dont need lanes and they dont need any more separation between cars than is necessary to let two streams of cars criss cross and turn at the intersection and pedestrians can just trust the car not to his them as they cross the road at any random spot riiight
162,uhh a bridge over the road why are you overcomplicating things
163,over or under walkways realistically i think the roads should be above ground everywhere pedestrians should not be at the same level with moving vehicles
164,self driving cars on paper would be far better than a bunch of stupid monkeys driving multiple ton death traps but considering how utterly incompetent every self driving car we have at this point its still a long way off if we can figure out perfect self driving cars then its not exactly hard to also accommodate pedestrians no idea why there would ever be such a stupid looking road though the cars would function just fine on a regular or lane road considering there would be no need for stopping therefor reduced traffic however all of this is entirely worthless when there could just be a working public transportation system
165,clearly youve never crossed a road in vietnam
166,just walk across the cars will stop for you kind of how they cross roads in some asian countries
167,a bridge over the road
168,a walkway that either tunnels under the road or an overpass bridge just a thought
169,a pedestrian bridge over the road no waiting for pedestrians either
170,bridges over road or something similar
171,build a train if we built more trains that wouldnt get rid of cars because they both have their own uses we already have roads so we might as well use them potholes youre right we would need a well maintained road for this to work crosswalk they could still exist similar to how these cars communicate with each other a crosswalk button could communicate with the cars software bug car crashes over million car crashes happen in the us per year from human error should we not allow humans to drive
172,bro they invented roads with no traffic lights more than years ago theyre called limited access highways they also invented something that can be put on other types of highways that flows kind of like this thats called a roundabout seriously carbrains tend to forget that roads exist and are not streets
173,how about a bridge over the road or a tunnel under it this isnt that fucking difficult it saves time for pedestrians too because you dont have to wait for a stoplight all the damn time
174,itd be crossy road irl haha
175,pedestrians are overrated right right europe who the hell doesnt like lanes road in their neighbourhood show me one person
176,crossy road irl
177,crossy road has prepared me for this
178,underover passes also not a huge amount of pedestrian traffic near interesting lane roads
179,if only we had a structure that could go over roads then we could cross the road while the traffic flows guess humanity isnt there yet
180,i guess when we have self driving cars there wont be any pedestrian bridges crossing the road wtf why was i trying to think sheesh
181,you arent theyll have to build elevated walkways over roadways which to be honest is how it should have been from the very beginning obviously the cost is why they didnt but at no point should pedestrians or cyclists have ever been using or crossing roads meant for cars its stupid its dangerous for everyone involved and hopefully eventually therell be enough of a push for smart traffic control that this will finally happen now obviously the best thing would have been for underground subways to be built everywhere or something like that but public transportation just isnt feasible in a lot of the us for example i invite any doubters to visit a spread out sprawling place like oklahoma and tell me buses trains etc would actually be a viable replacement so the future will probably remain cars
182,cross my road
183,i just had a thought why arent bridges going completely over the road more common actually ive literally never seen that wouldnt it save lives and speed up traffic
184,if theyre fully autonomous the middle of the road should be for going straight with either side being for turning either way like india but with less lanes
185,honestly self driving cars could potentially make the roads safer for pedestrians as theoretically obviously this would be different in practice a self driving car should never hit a pedestrian and would always stop or avoid them most pedestrian accidents happen because the driver was distracted or did not correctly follow traffic laws niether of which would be a problem for self deiving cars so essentially if you are a pedestrian trying to get across this road all you would need to do is walk across and pray that there isnt some bug in the self deiving system
186,bridges i love the idea of bridges on road walks i think theyre so cool or underground intersections i know the point this post is trying to make but i want cooler civil architecture im legit crying out for it please i want bridges
187,thats what all that cross road was for
188,theres these things called bridges you can build it can go over the road and you can easily cross edit everyones bringing up disabilitieswheelchairs just make it angled like every other thing thats wheelchair accessible
189,footbridges over the road a button that activates a crosswalk that all the cars obey smart cars that see a pedestrian and preemptively slow activating all the cars behind them to slow
190,your not meant to cross the road here its like the freeway you go somewhere else to cross
191,above roadway walkway crossings for pedestrians
192,either they arnt accounting for squirrels or that road is going to become a meat grinder
193,roads are for car and not push bike or people in this type of road system you would have no pedestrian walkway next to the roads except for at crossing point which would be overpass for pedestrians only
194,crossing this road will be frogger mixed with dark souls
195,a bridge over the road
196,yeah if only there was some form of pedestrian crossing that goes overunder the road and doesnt give a fuck about lightswe can call it pedestrian over crossing
197,keep roads and pedestrian walking areas separate overpassesunderpasses etc would be safer than current system too probably
198,prolly under the road or over
199,you can quite simply cross the road by building a pedestrian walkway either over or under it
200,pedestrian bridges over the roads
201,oh no who could have thought of people crossing roads back to the drawing board everyone almost guaranteed that when a system like this is fully ready to run pedestrians will be able to cross without any problems besides they said replace traffic lights not all traffic lights
202,how do i cross this road as a pedestrian thats the neat part you dont
203,id like to think that at this level of advancement with self driving cars we would also prioritize building over passes for civilians cyclists etc because yea it would be impossible to cross a road like this otherwise
204,ever played crossy road
205,you could always build a bridge or tunnel for pedestrians which is much better than a crossing anyway however as a software engineer the idea of getting in a car thats on that road is terrifying no way is that safe or could ever be safe vv for this kind of thing would be nightmarish to try and engineer even on paper let alone the real world
206,if you walk out the self driving cars will stop the sensors will tell them to pedestrians will rule the road if all cars were self driving
207,thats what neuralink is for theyll cross the road for you in sync with the traffic frogger style
208,someone link that dude that crossed a road in vietnamem or malasia i cannt recall
209,sweden has walkways that go over some of the larger roads and crossings to make walking safer for pedestrians and to create less traffic for the drivers
210,you cross the road by pressing a crosswalk button then the cars stop and let you walk
211,you will become the road
212,bridges that go over the road
213,i trust computers on the road a thousand times better than idiot humans
214,if we achieve this level of self driving cars then the number of cars on the road will drop dramatically since there would be no reason for a household to own more than one car it would also be far cheaper to lyftuber rather than buy or rent a car so a household can buy a car that delivers everyone to work and school at varying times theres no need for someone to take a car to work and park it for hours it can go back and forth for the other members of the household to use
215,it would also require that every car on the road be self driving which is just never going to happen
216,theres no reason to make up new driving rules for automated traffic flow that would make things difficult for times where manual driving is needed or for pedestrians synchronizing traffic lights utilizing alternate routes proportionally and avoiding hazards and construction would erase the majority of traffic and congestion while also decreasing travel speed which also results in better safety for cyclists and pedestrians cars would be networked at that point along with traffic signals and things like debris on the road downed power lines potholes etc would all be able to be reported in real time to the proper departments so wed see a decrease in say power outage durations during storms automatic ride sharing options would also decrease the amount of vehicles on the roads which in turn benefits all of the above the lives saved alone will be worth it the reduction of accidents will be astronomical and ticketting police would be virtually eliminated on the roads theyd need to find new ways to generate revenue
217,for a lane road so can an overpass
218,how about automated public transport to decrease the number of vehicles on the road
219,while i like the idea in theory im not sure that ai cars will ever be a common place thing as theres always gonna be people who a cant afford them or b dont want a robot to drive them that means manual drivers on the road and ai is horrible at figuring out people
220,i dont like cars either but pedestrian crossings have existed for a looooong time why would this junction be any different if anything if cars are ai controlled i would expect them to be even more adaptive to pedestrians and always stop when someone steps in the road etc i can see in future that pedestrian crossings might not be necessary although putting failsafes in might be tricky
221,for the record im anti stroad but to answer your question a footbridge
222,just need to build pedestrian walkways above or below the roads
223,overhead bridges at designated locations subways or any stretch of the road that isnt a junction
224,more so your brain on silicon valley techbro culture i work in tech im so sick of naive young developers that dont understand you cant solve everything with more software or that just because they understand software doesnt mean they know shit about other domains or that you know how to evaluate externalities the entire self driving car idea is a prime example of this truly self driving vehicles that work with no fallback on unmodified roads is unlikely to be approved anytime soon for good reason the edge cases are a way harder problem than the tech sector will admit and while some safety features driven by that tech are legitimately good ideas eg auto braking too much incomplete automation risks dangerous complacency by human drivers that are already overly distracted as it is particularly since it will fail in precisely the worst case scenarios
225,for a moment i was in the early days when silk road existed and im like thats reasonable it is no longer reasonable
226,i could see if we could somehow make crypto transactions super fast you could have super fast payment systems think ezpass based express lanes like we have now but you could make every lane in the highest cost different amounts and be demand driven like passing someone in the left lane could cost a few cents and the only left lane campers would be rich bros in their tesla roadsters its the future
227,isnt this the current reality with toll roads no need to fear some dystopic future when its already here
228,honestly id be ok with something like that so long as the pay system contributed entirely to the operation of the intersection and when the operational costs were met others wouldnt be charged or their taxes reduced theoretically that would create circumstances where a few people willing to shell out big bucks for priority or improved services would be benefiting everyone but the reality would probably be more like theme park fast passes where the park doesnt improve any rides or reduce entry fees but they also offer options for people to pay more to be put ahead of others making lines move more slowly for anyone not willing to pay for a priority pass theoretically business and first class fares for planes and trains brings down the price for economy seating but in reality i dont think it does because the airline just considers it additional profit but a public road with tolls or priority passes should have a fixed budget and if the priority contributors meet the budget others should be able to use it at no cost or at least reduced cost
229,if your roads have potholes maybe they should worry about that instead of the traffic lights
230,i honestly would trust driving a bike on the road more with self driving cars around its still awful and there should always be separate bicycle lanes but still
231,bicycles shouldnt be on the road they make it such a pain for cars grow up and get a car loser
232,thats wrong this is a simulation of two lane roads crossing
233,why wedont just remove humans from roads because cities build like that are ugly as shit and horrible place to live
234,i cant help but get upset when people call a crash an accident i lost my leg in a crash with a lorry it was preventable and even though the driver didnt intend for the crash to happen it was still his fault victoria crash victim roadpeaceorg involvedcrash not accident i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subreddit messagecompose torfuckcars if you have any questions or concerns

236,in very very slight fairness to the tweet self driving cars arent really what makes this a crime against pedestrians lanes roads are ludicrous no matter whats driving on them and x intersections are the blessedly imaginary product of a diseased imagination
237,i think both sides suffer from a strong case of car brain with automatic traffic you wouldnt get rid of pedestrian crossings instead it would be like creating a pedestrian crossing everywhere along the road you just have to make some kind signal like raising your arm or pressing a button on your phone and then walk across the street anywhere you cant deny that self driving cars are vastly superior to conventional ones even when there might be some even better solutions like trains
238,truly self driving vehicles that work with no fallback on unmodified roads is unlikely to be approved anytime soon they already are you can book a fully self driving waymo car in phoenix
239,and then an animal walks into the road or a mattress falls off a truck or theres a single pothole and one car has to swerve for it and so does everybody else and good luck everybody edit to everybody pointing out that automated cars can do this better than humans in cars thats true but the fact that self driving cars pole vault over that very low bar really shouldnt be our standard
240,tesla traffic light free roads to be rolled out nationwide in months years later tesla traffic light free road debuts in las vegas on a mile stretch of road with intersections however design now features the patented tesla speedlighttrade that send a automated ai controlled spectrum devided optical signals to cars when it is safe to cross the intersection
241,but humans arent perfect drivers either humans can tell the difference between a semitruck and a garbage can though they can predict the intentions of other drivers they can assume where snowed overworn away road markings were just by using intuition call me when a tesla can have common sense and not just rely on machine learning
242,dont come to michigan its more pothole than road
243,the thing is that is exactly what everyone in this sub want protected bike lanes separated from traffic unfortunately much of our urban planning assumes the use of cars and nothing else no biker enjoys sharing the road with cars but they are forced to due to a lack of alternatives car brains assume that putting in bike lanes somehow infringes on their freedom to drive cars safely when bikers freedom to drive safely has been ignored the whole time putting in bike lanes helps car drivers it reduces car traffic by reducing car reliance and increases safety for everyone sounds like a win win why wouldnt you want alternative forms of transit i enjoy driving but i also enjoy biking and walking why should i be forced into this one mode car infrastructure also costs the taxpayer exponentially more than bike infrastructure
244,if i had to cross a road with this many lanes regardless of whether the cars are self driving or human driven i would take the safer overhead bridge or underpass every time
245,any road thats reached lanes is already an absolute failure of infrastructure and urban planning that includes highways but is especially true concerning city streets like this
246,i dont know if its possible to accurately predict that for example we can imagine that if it was easy to summon an autonomous rideshare car within a couple of minutes to go wherever you wanted to go fewer people would own cars less space would be devoted to parking and because of the share aspect there would be fewer cars on the road and although the above simulation is ridiculous indeed autonomous cars if they ever actually work will make far more efficient use of the road space so fewer vehicles travelling more efficiently much less road space used of course there are many other factors so that is very much an idealised scenario that would not ever be realised not least of which being that if its that quick and easy to use cars in this way as well as cheap then that could draw passengers from buses and trainsmaking the situation actually worse
247,roads are cheap when you dont maintain them
248,lol yea this is a ridiculous road and the cars stop anyway
249,which in my experience in spite of being safer and decreasing the risk of accidents and traffic jams rarely ever happens if the rules of the road were followed to a t instead of having of drivers thinking theyre better than most drivers and being ok disobeying the rules because theyre familiarity with a car outruled their sense of dangerresponsibility instead of having selfish drivers who arbitrarily decide to get ahead of everyone else despite no inherent need for it instead of everyone creating barely an inch gap between cars or taking advantage of those with enough space by forcing yourself in there the road would be much safer and more efficient which is why trains rule
250,driving is hard and requires a lot of knowledge of not just the rules of the road but an intuition of how to actually drive the road is covered in weird edge cases and computers are just really bad at adapting to new things like imagine youre in a city at a traffic light trying to turn right theres a bicyclist in the same lane as you hes not turning and theres a giant pothole in your normal turn path you can see all of this just through a quick glance youd know alright ill wait for the bicyclist to go then ill turn but ill go slow and dodge the pothole getting a computer to not only detect these things but also respond to them properly is really hard theres no strict rule that governs the situation i just made up but humans can pretty easily apply understanding from similar situations weve seen in the past and our conceptual understanding of why potholes are bad and cyclists have right of way computers have no conceptual understanding of what theyre doing theyre pattern machines show them anything outside the pattern and they break down roads are full of things that dont fit the pattern thats just one major issue and it doesnt even address getting data into the car itself nobody has a good system for that yet all of them have some major issues
251,and then we can use iron wheels and a kind of iron road to reduce friction
252,wow i knew vegas was bad but this is just ridiculous theres like half a km between pedestrian bridges with barriers all along the road to prevent pedestrians from taking a reasonable route thats like a min walk just to cross the road from mid block in the middle of the largest tourist attraction in the country
253,i dont know if its possible to accurately predict that it is and is well understood by traffic engineers and city planners see enwikipediaorgwikiinduced_demand if it was easy to summon an autonomous rideshare fewer people would own cars less space would be devoted to parking all true but you are forgetting how much induced demand is going to be created by cheap autonomous cars that allow people of all ages to work have meeting study sleep watch movies party while on the road consider how many people would sleep while traveling at night on weekends to visit other cities for gridlock if future for autonomous vehicles is plentiful cheap journeys theconversationcomself driving cars will not fix our transportation woes
254,because of the share aspect there would be fewer cars on the road yeah im not so sure the idea of sharing is that instead of a car sitting in my driveway or garage it leaves and services another person but my car in my garage isnt clogging up the roads while im not using it overall we still need as many cars as we have now to cover variable demand at peak times they just wont be sitting in garages and parking lots still a good benefit since we do have an absurd amount of cars just sitting around most of the time but i look at those battery powered scooters that appeared in cities like a plague being possible for autonomous cars an oversaturation to ensure high availability
255,you should research some topics before you write out things that arent true lol ais get significantly worse the more general they get even now we barely have competent autotranslators ffs even youtubes dmca detection is a failure and people still think that we can make cars drive themselves in the near future yes there are self driving success stories because theyre all tested under a very strict ruleset now add something new to the formula like snow or black ice or temporary changed road conditions and the results become a joke waymo can barely even understand when its appropriate to stop in case of a threat
256,theyre self driving cars not a transportation megamind to do what you want the cars would each need to know the disposition of every other car on the road long before they could resolve each other visually
257,could be you can see how many of those cars are a hairbreadth apart i do agree that automated driving could be safer but i prefer to consider the elimination of road emotions over this ridiculous stunt weave
258,yes do those scooters induce demand every time i see one i prefer to think thats one less car on the roads
259,my car in my garage isnt clogging up the roads while im not using it you think a garage is not taking space in a city overall we still need as many cars as we have now to cover variable demand at peak times citation needed i look at those battery powered scooters that appeared in cities like a plague if anything they help reducing traffic
260,twelve lane road should never exist twelve lane roads shouldnt even be considered
261,well id like to go check that out but its on the other side of the stroad i guess were staying here all night
262,like some kind of rail road
263,you think a garage is not taking space in a city i was specifically referencing the idea that car sharing would mean less cars on the road you know like what i quoted also how i said isnt clogging up the roads should have been enough there right citation needed you wont find a citation for this because its an opinion based on observation not a studied fact see uberscabs in cities now thats technically the same as an autonomous car that is used by many it just has a manual driver for now have we seen less traffic with the introduction of these services it doesnt seem like it feel free to refute this properly with your own citations but im just having a conversation not writing a paper if anything they help reducing traffic missing the point they introduced a massive amount of these things because as a company you want them to always be available the same will be true of any company pushing out a fleet of autonomous vehicles designed to arrive to your home quickly the service will fail if people miss their appointments due to waiting on a car to be available i wasnt commenting on whether the scooters reduced traffic or not
264,simple divide up train carts like gondolas people can have their own private compartment rather then big ones elons tesla tunnel or whatever is essentially just that minus it being on a track and connected but in all honesty wealthy individuals want to sell as much gas cars insurance plans road work tires etc we dont have trains because it threatens giant corporations business models its the same reason we have had to fighting for green energy coal and oil dont want their businesses to become obsolete
265,the brain can do something the computer cannot abstraction imagine a piece of paper torn cut drawn into whatever your brain will always recognise it as a piece of paper the best computer in the world will not after enough modification this is not solely memory you will never have seen this exact image of the torn paper in your life but you know what it is the computer can only rely on instructionsrules programming and memory machine learning etc so if it has never seen either exactly this paper or a reasonably similar one it cannot recognise it back to the car problem imagine the complexity of assessing a dangerous situation just down to how do i determine that the thing on the road is harmless or a threat the computer can only know what its been told via programming so if whoever did that did not consider a situation or the computer is not able to do what most brains are able to effortlessly you are fucked in case that the situation is assessed correctly the computer will act better since it can calculate what to do but for the first step the human brain is infinitely better
266,if people move towards robotaxis like others have pointed out there is room for saving money on something similar to uberpool where you carpool going similar directions or the same place self driving cars offer a lot more flexibility for people to reduce the number of cars on the road and the need for parking its not an ideal environmental solution but self driving electric cars would be a cast improvement over our current system
267,yeah theres a lot of shit drivers here most of my job is looking into restrictions from duis yikes again but for requirements its similar here in theory but not that strenuous eta i may be underestimating the requirements based on memory i am not involved in the licensing process when i did this a decade ago i think it was hours of practice required plus optional driving school a mandatory driving skills test very lenient honestly as a teen i wasnt a good driver but i passed a knowledge test rules of the road i found it easy but if i took it now it might be harder a lot of laws are really finicky and a fee nobody explained how to maintain a car change a tire jump a battery etc it was just can you operate the vehicle and not kill someone
268,not at the start but gradually older cars could be removed if we get to a point where autonomous cars are significantly safer and accessible i can see roads where only autonomous vehicles are permitted to circulate
269,ah of course subroads
270,like an underground railroad
271,ur not mad at bicyclists ur mad at the crap infrastructure design forcing bike riders to share roads with oversized family apcs
272,cyclists also ride in the middle of the road in rural areas and suburbs and hold up traffic because there are no bike lanes so they have to ride in the middle of the road because there is no other choice the problem is with poor infrastructure not people who want to use a cleaner safer and healthier form of transportation or simply just enjoy riding bikes
273,ehh bicyclists should follow the road rules only because it is defensive about other cars who dont see a bicycle
274,got yelled at by a driver for passing him on the right in slow traffic then cutting over to a left turn lane then the driver who yelled at me made an unsignaled right on red without coming to a complete stop right after telling me i need to follow all the rules if i wanted to be on the road
275,bikers are free to try the rest may die trying wanna occupy the road follow the rules or get the fuck on a bike path
276,i mean yea some of those are pretty true and they tend to piss me off especially the text while drive situation but yall cyclists need to stop acting like you own the fucking road because while some drivers can be very irresponsible while they are driving yall cyclists need to keep an eye out yo so i rlly just ends up going both ways for both of yall
277,maybe if they used the bikelane instead of being in the middle of the road people wouldnt get mad
278,if you paid road tax youd be fine oh wait no youd just get the next hurdle thrown at you registration meet that requirement mandatory helmet license plates high vis mots only allowed to use roads if no cycle lane exists banned from all roads etc etc will just stretch on and on you meet whatever shit exclusionary bollocks they want they will introduce more outright saying fuck you get banned is a faux pas so we just get this timid creep of bullshit requirements instead that theyre drooling to implement
279,cant tell if youre driving a car or cycling haha doesnt matter if im in my work vehicle that is slow to accelerate or my little sports car people hate that i dont rolling stop the only cyclists i dont like are the ones that disrespect both the road rules and the sidewalks in one go
280,great but here where i live in the midwest gas guzzling vehicles are god people whine constantly about bike lanes and theres a literal referendum being put on the ballot because a few business owners got pissy at the idea of a road diet because they want a lane monstrosity as the main artery through town so day in and day out those gas guzzler fans go about their day without word regarding their fellow drivers then they witness one person on a bicycle roll through a stop sign and they take to social media to complain there are thousands of cars and trucks on the road here tens or maybe hundreds of bicycles there are significantly more complaints about bicycles
281,in the uk motorists say this all the time about the road tax even though the road tax was abolished a long time ago in the us they talk about gas tax even though it doesnt cover maintenance and virtually all new road construction is paid for out of general revenues
282,now i get back at drivers by being extremely cautious is this extremely cautious or antagonistic full stop at a stop sign good slowly acc decelerating why are you attempting to provoke road rage e this is a hate sub against drivers not bad drivers but drivers in general
283,and my response as a cyclist is yes let me pay road tax ill happily pay it because when i do i get to have my own private cyclist only bit of road that car drivers cant use and it will need to stretch all across the country you know like roads they oddly dont like that as my response
284,you still have to pay tax to use your car on the road in the uk
285,slow acceleration and deceleration because driving a car is dangerous get the fuck outta here if driving safely provokes road road thats on the bad drivers not the person exercising caution
286,i was more trying to point out the chaos on the roads in california from it i dont think letting people drive more erratically on the road is helping anyone or fostering an environment thats safe for cyclists and pedestrians but if youre going to talk about lane splitting not hurting anything hwy is the worst example its notoriously dangerous for motorcycles lol
287,i will often go out of my way to ride down main st on my bike taking the lane slowing down people who want to do kmh in what should be a kmh zone people who do dangerous shit in the streets of my city deserve to be purposefully slowed down excessive slowness sounds like a dream compared to the hellscape that is our road network currently
288,aww is comprehension hard for somebody see the people on the right on their computers those are the people im making a point about day in and day out people in their cars and trucks witness other car and truck drivers do stupid shit and they just go on about life as usual but those same car and truck drivers will see one person on a bicycle roll through a stop sign or litter or weave in and out of traffic or do some other thing and take to social media bitching about all bicyclists the point is that both groups are guilty of bad behavior but we dont seem to automatically assume all drivers to be terrible because we witness one guy forget to use a blinker but witness one guy on a bicycle forget to use a hand signal and boomer bob is on facebook bitching about how bicycles shouldnt be allowed on the road
289,heavier vehicles are also worse for the environment which usually doesnt get factored into the calculations of how bad evs are for the environment the roads are paved with fossil fuels and increasing vehicle weight exponentially increases road damage the tailpipe emissions are better but once you factor in road damage and battery manufacturing evs are worse unless youre talking about evs that are lighter weight like golf carts swapping out hummers with golf carts would be a step in the right direction five ton electric hummers is way way worse
290,heavier cars breaking down concrete roads faster and concrete production being one of the largest c emitters
291,heavier vehicles also means greater deterioration and thus maintenanceupkeep costs of all those streets stroads parking lots and freeways further bankrupting cities if ev is the future i hope everyone is ok trading high speed boxes for a total lack of government services or gasp much higher taxes
292,evs are also heavier this leads us to something very counterintuitive evs are louder i know it is hard to believe next time a car drives by listen closely it is not the engine you hear over miles or kmh it is mostly tire noise the heavier the car the more tire noises you get other things that grow exponential tire noise and weight road damage and weight consumption and speed these are all things that grow exponentially a t car is only twice as heavy as a t car but does more than twice the road damage
293,ok so what is the public transportation system that is going to keep all cars off the road how much is it going to cost and how long will it take to build where do you construct it in major cities with dense populations
294,dont forget that asphalt roads pollute a sh t ton
295,no the noise i hear most is tire and wind noise that is not getting any better with evs on the fumes though theres some roads where i can definitely notice the effect of exhaust like uphill thoroughfares
296,i buy the argument that we arent properly accounting for the extra road wear for weight but im not convinced they are worse than gas cars just because of that without some more data do you have some that could convince me
297,for sure theyre better from the perspective of local emissions and air quality but thats a pretty limited perspective on the impacts and harms of cars and i could just as easily say that trains and sensible public transit are better than both i genuinely dont look forward to the explosion of electric vehicles that exacerbate a trend towards heavier larger cars making more noise wearing roads and tires more quickly endangering pedestrians and other road users and putting a segment of the population back to sleep with respect to the fact that the car centric world is not the world that we deserve thats without getting into the impact of extractive industries both on the environment and the people swept up in it and the outstanding battery waste problem for which we have nothing more than promised solutions that may or may not resolve into actual solutions while yet again we allow the problem to grow at an astronomical rate in the meantime
298,not disregard just recognise it as at best a stepping stone and getting rid of cars is politically difficult but realistically just involves making other forms of transport more convenient set up great public transport infrastructure safe cycle lanes narrow existing roads remove parking minimums modify roads to force lower speeds make dedicated bus lanes etc if it takes an hour to get where youre going by car but half an hour by subway the choice is fairly obvious
299,does that include all the saved emissions from pumping the oil refining it and transporting it including ocean liners or is it just the difference between creating x watts of usable power from y tons of fuel i mean power plants tend to operate at the highest efficiencies possible and power loss across the grid is pretty minimal while gas has to be transported by road and most car engines dont go about percent efficiency and even that is super high just seems pretty hard to believe
300,yes the car is a specific technology with specific uses currently we use it for far more than it is useful for and the consequences are very detrimental to society not to mention the environment as per your example in communities where people cycle more the elderly have greater mobility later on in life because they lead more active lifestyles and because they are able to ride a bike safely in old age and not endanger others as with an automobile of course for those who are not able to walk or ride there are other options but these modes can function better because roads are occupied only with those functions that are deemed most necessary optimal for that specific mode and not clogged up
301,heavy vehicles trucks buses etc cause far more road wear than even heavy passenger vehicles
302,thats very true a lot of our cycle lanes take quite scenic routes away from road and through parks which i think id miss definitely beats being in noisy traffic only downside is trains are expensive here and itd be nice to do longer distance travel which wouldnt be possible on an ebike
303,public transport needs to be built up and funded better cycle lanes should be given some priority rather than just painting a line on the gutter and calling it a day roads in inner cities should be narrowed and there should be dedicated bustran lanes and single family zoning should be abolished to allow for much more productive less sprawling and more pleasant mixed areas there are a great many solutions but in so many places the people who get to decide how to allocate funding see every problem as being solved by building a new highway or broadening existing roads
304,nah i test drove a model and the road nose was unbearable esp since theres no engine noise went with a lexus hybrid sedan even tho i hate gas vehicles but so much quieter ride while still getting mpg
305,pushing for semi trailer trucks to be limited and moving the long haul transport to trains would alleviate a good chunk of the road wear problem
306,electricity doesnt get delivered via roadways so its a win even if the cars are heavier electric semis are going to be the same weight
307,i mean ideally we need to stop being csr centric and let the evs be a stop gap invest that stroad money in better public transit better zoning and mix used infrastructure
308,i dont really understand how this is a counterpoint like of course the battery issue is compounded by the need for batteries in grid storage and of course we arent in this moment prepared to give up cars completely but none of that discounts that electric cars are at best an imperfect solution to the broad problem of cars and that if theyre treated as a copypaste solution which seems to be the auto industrys present drive then they will absolutely fail in that regard i feel like theres a tendency towards absolutist or all or nothing thinking with regards to these problem when the reality is that if we want to thread this needle a diversity of solutions deployed with sensitivity and sensibility is what were going to need for instance with regards to the battery problem i expect that it will be much easier to reduce battery demand in the auto sector by easing our dependence on cars than it will be in the grid scale energy storage sector where few good alternatives exist though i remain hopeful for grid scale thermal batteriesheat engines edit to add also nowhere in this have i argued that we should stick with internal combustion that would be an absurd reading of this discussion i think
309,you can have good public transport and reasonable roads at the same time buses use the same roads that cars do but save space by putting dozens of people in the space taken up by a handful of cars and subways take up no road space at all then once the public transport can carry a significant portion of commuters put more measures in place to discourage car use
310,who said theyre magically more aerodynamic evs are range constrained theyll always be designed with a lower drag coefficient than their gasdiesel counterparts why do you think the top most aerodynamic vehicles on the road are all evphev
311,thats very fair like a chevy bolt is probably gonna be quieter due to its weight and tire size but it gets fairly annoying since im living in the bay area and every cars is a tesla overall road noise has gone down especially comparing the tesla suvs to a truck or gas suv but the model s and s have not been my favorite to listen to maybe its placebo due to the lack of engine noise but the prius and rav hybrids are quite a bit softer in sound even with engine noise tho the toyota regen is way too loud im super sensitive to sounds and theres just a distinct noise road i cant place my foot on with tesla sedans and i really wish theyd come out with a vehicle that didnt prioritize speed and put some inch wheels and smaller battery but similar range and less acceleration not to an nissan leaf extent but still would help with the noise problem
312,yea thats such a huge point too like for all the shit the prius got it really was an efficient vehicle there never was an environmental point of a tesla if you wanted a car that was actually trying to be more efficient and eco friendly youd end up with the leafs and the bolts and the ioniqs instead we got the lucius and tesla plaids trying to be high performance cars will say taking a rivian off road is pretty cool and beats out people taking shit like raptors off roading
313,also car centric infrastructure such as suburbs tend to destroy public spaces segregate society and broadly isolate us from our fellow human beings which is detrimental to the human soul
314,sound pollution is another big one that pisses me off try walking next to a well trafficked road and youll feel mushy in your head
315,joined from place love the sentiment i try to ebike to work when roads arent covered in ice i clench my teeth when driving because im hyper aware of all surroundings it gives me anxiety road bikeebike is all smiles even when its raining so hard youd be just as well off jumping into a lake
316,i feel like we underrate that cars are ugly as fuck roads gas stations cars themselves heaven forbid a parking lot the whole thing is a gigantic eyesore
317,figure we should clarify that the infrastructure is the main issue also that recreationally car use such as racing is ok would help to prevent the alienation of car enthusiasts who hate traffic and stroads as much as us
318,in my country we already have cycling roads
319,cars are awesome too bad people live in bad regulated places like the us where i come from there is actually thought behind the design of roads
320,i recently moved to long beach ca and my mind is blown by how a place that almost gets it all right managed to fuck it all up due to cars many neighborhoods in lbc are walkable nice with lots of trees and tons of potential for good public transit but instead we get a hellish grid of roads where every square inch is covered in cars parked or driving like insane people with crosswalks that arent respected at all by drivers making the simple act of walking a mile to the store stressful like its so fucking close to being awesome that it pisses me off fuck cars
321,im not scared of riding my bike in the city its in the countryside where there is roads with lines directly at the end of the asphalt and cars driving faster than kmh whatever the limit on the road is
322,or how about not being on the road qhere the fuckim cara are at this sub is a fuckin joke
323,my friends dad passed away in broad daylight because of a careless driver in their culture they cant partake in any holidays and celebrations for a year after the funeral when i went home for the holidays i gave my friend a small gift which they couldnt enjoy for a few months seriously cars shouldnt be the only option
324,same i dont drive because of anxiety issues and i live next to a giant ass stroad the feeling of trying to calmly walk down a narrow sidewalk as a car hurtles towards me at mph is not something i enjoy
325,cars arent a good tool though there are vehicles that are better suited for almost every single task except going on a roadtrip
326,imagine driving without getting stuck in traffic or having to deal with people who hate driving but are forced to seems like better public transit is really an ideal scenario for people who enjoy driving they get the road to themselves
327,in bangkok half the vehicles on the road are motorbikes they are loud and annoying when driving a car since they squeeze between other cars but kinda necessary traffic is so bad here that if everyone drove a car instead of a motorbike i cant imagine how id get anywhere so id say motorbikes are much better than cars but they still cause a lot of pollution
328,i would say better to have tram tracks in all roads than fully replace them
329,we should have train lines alongside roads improve and encourage public transportation and shrink roads to fewer lanes with the goal being to reduce traffic to only the situations its needed utility carsvans some buses people who live rurally and are trying to get to the rails and stuff like that
330,wouldnt it be better if youre driving on a road where only people who want to drive drive its a breeze to have no traffic
331,i would think that with less space taken up by suburban sprawl and whiny hoa neighborhoods auto enthusiasts would have more land and less restrictions placed on them for building private road courses rallyx courses whatever youre into and imagine the amount of dirt cheap projects you could buy if people who dont like driving could get rid of their cars in favor of public transit
332,personally i dont have a problem with cars for recreational use i love driving long distances for weekend trips especially out along rural roads car dependency is bad though and thats what everyone here has a problem with the problems associated with cars arent caused by car enthusiasts having fun on a weekend excluding street racing ofc but with every single person being compelled to own a car to function in society despite it being costly polluting dangerous and the least efficient method of transport in a city
333,ive seen plenty of people here that like motorsports including me and one thing we all have in common is that we agree that driving on public roads with other people is absolute garbage whats the point of having a fast car if you wont take it to the track where it can be properly and safely used
334,where i live there are plenty of people who bike in rural areas in my opinion these areas would gain a lot from having cycle infrastructure because the only option for bike riders is to ride on the side of a high speed roadway it would also be relatively inexpensive to build due to the cheap land and available space that being said i definitely understand the thought of braving such weather is a hard pill to swallow
335,actually yes theyre extremely economical can be built very fuel efficient very very low road wear not much larger than a bike compared to a car and if you drive an electric one i know theyre ass at the moment but give it years then theyre a solid go to this sub has mixed opinions on them but honestly what you want to do doesnt matter its just about pushing for reducing car dependency
336,electricity still largely runs on energy that produces co so its barely a solution to the climate change problem self driving cars do not solve the issues with traffic congestion road infrastructure being hostile to pedestrians and not to mention in their current state a hell of a lot more dangerous there was a video on twitter where a person test driving a self driving car while in a public city keep in mind had to stop it from hitting pedestrians on a cross walk so yeah fuck all cars lol
337,still lots of problems cars are an incredibly inefficient use of space parking roads force people under to stay inside are still much more dangerous than transit are anti poor even if theyre self driving still cause a ton of pollution walking helps local businesses because people are more likely to stop in mom pop shops when theyre not zooming past etc also just a personal opinion but walkable cities tend to be way more aesthetically pleasing
338,that doesnt mean that everyone who doesnt have a passion for cars should be forced to drive for example if someone had a passion for trains would that justify eliminating all roads and making transportation only possible by rail
339,im from the netherlands where we basically have the kind of infrastructure this sub is all about and yes i have its fucking awesome to drive on an open road sadly if everyone had to drive to work or the supermarket we wouldnt have an open road we already have a lot of traffic jams and we have more bikes than people which are actively used if we relied on cars like we do on bikes our entire country would be gridlocked now i have a supermarket within minutes of biking distance separated from cars the entire time similarly anyone who needs a lot of groceries and has to use the car has parking space because my bike takes up a quarter of a small car and an th of an american pick up i can go to work without worrying about traffic because theres a train every minutes and my father who is car dependent has one car less or traffic that takes up road space have you ever driven somewhere with a lot of bicycles on the road getting in your way i havent very often for one thing because in a bike accessible location i can also use my bike and second when i do drive bicycles have their own space both of our lives are better making traffic more accessible for anything that isnt a car also improves traffic for cars it benefits everyone
340,wouldnt it be better if youre driving on a road where only people who want to drive drive its a breeze to have no traffic
341,as a motorsport fan i can agree but at the same time of the people driving on the road are not car enthusiasts like you and i if you like cars that much keep driving the whole idea of this subreddit actually makes driving a more pleasant experience for those who actually want to drive
342,except we have no alternative and people could quite possibly like actually die without the food they bring but yes people should stop overconsumption so that we need fewer ships to carry cargo overseas and we should be researching ways to make cargo ships less polluting keep in mind though cargo ships are really quite efficient and they dont cause pollution due to road wear
343,it sounds like your country is already using steps into making cars as a form of travel not mandatory this is good here this is exactly the change we advocate for so in not sure why that makes you against this many things are culture and no one is saying to get rid of cars completely many on this sub are car enthusiasts but dislike the problems from car oriented citiessuburbs in only the most rural places is public transit not an option but that doesnt mean roads cant be designed in a safer way for all users in those places maybe roundabouts on high speed roads and on slower rural roads there could be traffic calming measures like narrower lanes or trees pokedex closer to the road however the places where change well be the most impactful are urban and suburban areas and that is why you will see an urbansuburban focus on this subreddit have a good day as well
344,and thats the lucky scenario where they dont also try to run you off the road at the same time
345,being scared isnt thinking about risk and you need to understand that whilst you think youre helping people its experienced as really condescending and unhelpful if you attempt to correct peoples fears by _akshuallying_ them away human psychology just doesnt work that way there are such things as irrational fears but fear of cycling on stroads isnt one of them i will tell you without reservation as someone who currently cycles of the trips i make in the uk that i wouldnt cycle anywhere like fake london based on what i can see from the njb videos it is times as risky as the uk which is in turn times as risky as cycling in the nl but even nls risk is already not negligible especially when looking at injury as well as death the risk of catastrophic injury when cycling is too damn high _everywhere_ and its made high by the presence of the death machines
346,how about you take a walk down this road contentuploadsgood hope road sidewalk sara about to cross jpg ssl then and see where this dont think about just risk gets you
347,so i live in a very weird development outside of a very stupid town in california its in the bay area but outside the urbanized parts so its all suburbia and what its got that passes for a downtown is more of an asphalt prairie with some buildings dotted around it one of which is a chevron regional headquarters so thats fucking awesome the main road i live closest to turns into i counted a nine lane stroad about a mile down the way just after it crosses the freeway and also city hall is right there now the development im in has some good ideas its townhouses which are cool and a whole bunch of people live in a small area so it feels a little livelier than most other places ive lived in and the development itself is pedestrianized and all the buildings are connected by these lovely little walkways but at the same time the nearest businesses are over a mile away in a strip mall that includes a supermarket a salon a smoothie place some other bullshit and the greatest insult of them all the only bar within a mile of me is a fucking taco bell cantina which is just a taco bell with a liquor license sometimes i feel like getting a drink and then i see that logo and i think going in there is sadder than staying sober and i just go home instead growing up i was always on the receiving end of those warnings about drunk driving and i was always like well if youre at a place and have some drinks how the fuck else are you supposed to get home how do bars stay in business if the only way to get home from them is something you cant do after participating in their business model i have so many questions because until i discovered places like this it seemed obvious to me that everywhere youd ever want to go would be so far away that you wouldnt be able to get there without a car but then i discovered that people in other parts of the world literally live blocks away from yknow music venues and bars and clubs and nice public spaces and other types of good nightlife and can walk there and then when theyre done getting blitzed or whatever it is they do in places like that they can stagger home fuckin blew my mind the first time i encountered something like that in person all of which is to say that i have no trouble believing what youre saying is absolutely true but my personal experience with it has been more about sadness and social isolation fuck cars
348,were on the same side at least for now if we get what we want transit and walkability you automatically get less congested roads further out to enjoy your car on the car in fuckcars is the car of the general zeitgeist and the car manufacturers want to sell you an unrepairable computerised tall wide monster that gets mpg doesnt fit in a parking space and isnt even useful as a commercial vehicle its main function is to pad someones vanity or soothe their fear about someone in an even bigger car hitting them and the net result is you need one to do things that take longer than they would if you just walked and hadnt designed the city around them in the first place cars as a hobby still pollute and some are too loud but have none of the other problems the name is intentionally incendary and this was more of a safe space for people to bitch without having to explain the nuance it does serve a purpose though in that it draws a lot of attention which is valuable for getting people like you to think and engage where otherwise you may never have noticed just as you likely never really noticed the urban planning walkable cities transit and similar focused communities
349,if more people are off the roads thats more space for you to drive your convertible or whatever instead of sitting it gridlock
350,im stuck in miserable murica so thats never gonna happen for where i live nearest train station from my town is around miles sucks cause my friend is a major train maniac he is moving to the south where the railroad systems are more premenant actually got a scholarship to me a mechanic for the newer electric trains
351,i think that first wed need better bike lanes that are physically separate from roads the bike lane infrastructure is insanely bad and no one would switch to bikes just because the lights are synchronized to them i do like that idea though personally it would be amazing on my biking commute to work
352,it could also potentially mean that each car gets to its destination faster leading to less cars on the road
353,for the love of god never race on the street i never said anything about that i just said driving a fun car that doesnt sound like a kettle is something you look forward to you dont have to push it cause its a fun car hence it doesnt need to be pushed like a good old sporty hatchback or an integra also i have about mins of traffic max every day and thats always after exiting or entering the highway the rest minutes of transit is actual driving and my god would i love to try out a train those things are speedy as all hell if i could get to my work faster than my car and not in x the time like buses take then im all in btw thanks for not being braindead bad putting some thought into your answer sidenote where i live there are no car racetracks closest one is hr away definitely not worth it there used to be a kart racetrack which is used for bike racing now but that doesnt count for the fun car point you made regardless never race on the street even if the road is empty and its am its always more exciting to go home than going to the hospital unless youre kinky in which case i cant help you lol
354,its very neighborhood dependent where i am is pretty nice but walk mile north and its the ghetto mile south and its bougie mansions and the beach major roads seem to be the divider which is another interesting note you can go from nice neighborhood to yeah i shouldnt be here right now just by crossing for example cherry ave ive seen enough good neighborhoods to see the potential but the traffic and cars and road culture makes even the nice neighborhoods kinda shit
355,i totally agree i take public transport to work the issue is the methods of legislating the car out of the city centre right now in the uk birmingham council are charging per calendar day to drive within the ring road if i head to a venue on an evening and have to load out equipment and drive home at i am charged the ring road contains all of the music venues and the vast majority of rehearsal spaces several of the rehearsal spaces are already making posts about going out of business because of this i have a diesel car i could sell it for k and buy a version for k and then be able to drive into town for free if there was any genuine alternative to driving or selling my car for something else i would do it i cant afford an electric car and dont have a driveway so couldnt charge at home regardless terraced houses in the uk make this impossible in a lot of poorer areas taxis arent appropriate ive previously run charity events putting on regular gigs in liverpool and birmingham and even with a good relationship with certain taxi companies half of the drivers refuse to load amps or drum kits into their car enforce it on the business not the people its exactly the same way companies are responsible for of emissions but the onus is increasingly put onto the individual
356,i knew two unhoused people who were killed by cars running off the road and into their tentson two separate occasions and a third who was murdered using a car as the weapon edit oh ill add one who was mutilated by a cops motorcycle and is now disabled for life
357,in san francisco they closed one of the main roads that runs through golden gate park it is only for pedestrians for now i was completely unaware of this until i was walking on the sidewalk and realized there were people everywhere talking walking together playing riding bikes having lunch lounging in the grass it is beyond description the feel of it it felt so beautiful peaceful and together it feels like living in a better future i really do think car infrastructure has made life so lonely and sad i dont want people to keep living it for generations
358,see i enjoy distance driving blasting down an open stretch of road hundreds of miles from anywhere familiar to me is such a sense of freedom spotting cool places to stop and check out is incredible and it helps that i have a pretty light pretty low reasonably well handling sort of peppy for an inline while still getting over mpg fun slow car one so normal that regular car reviews did a very regular review of it but traffic blows city driving blows and driving familiar routes blows except for that one corner that you can take a little too fast and feel the weight transfer through the car and know that youre still fully in control while feeling some very fun forces that remind you of childhood at the local go kart track where they put lawnmower engines into a fiberglass body with bumpers all around i desperately want a track car something i can take to a nearby circuit on club days maybe a first generation miata or a neon maybe a civic maybe an old bimmer series maybe an mr or gti but for now my wagon and public roads will have to suffice
359,on public transport drunk people fight in cars drunk people murder other road users both are bad of course but i know which id rather
360,i mean i dont maintain it for that long once the downhill stops id say i can probably maintain kmh on a perfectly flat road i presume i have some things in my favour though being a health conscious year old guy and presumably something in my genes makes me predisposed for swole ass thighs theres also a bunch of gravel on the roads in the winter which means i get extra training i got back on the bike this year and at first i was struggling so much that i lowered my gearing by replacing the drive gear and now im back on the normal drive and very often irritated that i dont have a higher gear like the only reason i cant go above kmh is because i have to spin my legs like a cartoon character given higher gears i would wager that i could reach at least kmh on a slight downhill of course my bike computer could just be completely wrong but it seems to agree with those radar based speed signs and at top speed i keep up with the cars so also a tip for anyone who wants to go faster if your tyres are ancient and basically falling apart please buy a new pair maybe its just placebo but i feel like just replacing my rear tyre made it much easier to pedal
361,no thanks i personally enjoy driving for leisure like late night highway cruises or timing myself on my local twisty backroad however i understand that not everyone else shares my enthusiasm or financial privilege that they can afford to own and maintain a car yet they need one to survive in the modern world and thats a problem
362,the infrastructure was built in the s the roads to build cars bulldozed houses and small businesses and closed lots of other businesses by killing foot traffic amsterdam used to be car dependent too but they managed to turn it around
363,just because you dont have the imagination to imagine a better future for everyone doesnt mean everyone is bereft of that capability even if for purely selfish reasons subsidizing transit would mean less cars on the road for you to contend with on the way home would probably greatly benefit at least some of your friends neighbors and coworkers and would mean less pollution for the world over all cheers
364,and the road rage some of it justified eg people driving unsafely and putting your and other peoples lives in even more needless danger and a lot of it not eg working class people pitted against each other in a competition of cutting each other off to get to work seconds earlier in the hope that they dont get fired by the capitalist slave master
365,i will say that when i lived in rural area people just stop in the road roll down windows and have a conversation blocking both lanes i liked it the context you really do need a car when you have only neighbours in min walking distance is important though and things like park ride transit needs to be normalized not linked to income as ive seen seems to happen when ive visited the usa
366,youre worried about the government rebuilding your area are you aware of how lots of those highways got built in the first place and it doesnt have to be some giant restructuring of land simple things like lifting r zoning restrictions to allow for mid level mixed use development and slicing up oversized roads to add sidewalks and bike paths would do a lot busses already work atop existing infrastructure too
367,do you know if they have plans for a model with maybe more off road tires out in the midwest is all dirt roads and i know from experience the more street tires dont like loose gravel insurance views me as humpty dumpy for a reason ironically the only reason i havent been to the hospital is my motorbike
368,half of ours roads are based on paths from horses my town is over years old
369,yes hundreds of years most of our roads and properties are based on horse paths
370,most suvs and big trucks on the road routinely haul one person and no cargo maybe gas prices will create a shift though its more likely that americans just buy suv and big truck evs but those impractical anti fun vehicles are absolutely absurd to use as a daily driver if you routinely need to haul around people consider a wagon or a crossover rather than an suv if you routinely need to haul cargo an f super duty harley davidson edition or whatever is about as pathetic at hauling as a ford ranger in both cases your driving experience will be far more enjoyable in the smaller lighter vehicle
371,ive been traveling and driving the country since the fall and while its been fun being out in the mountains and open roads im really fucking sick of it after being stuck in la for the past couple months makes me appreciate and miss nyc even more though i will say the times i did drive in new york were kind of fun because its such a challenging clusterfuck
372,ugh so true i had to pretty much give it up after fender benders in one day came to the conclusion that my condition makes me dangerous on the road ive since moved to nyc and am no longer a threat to public safety lol
373,yeah i feel you there they keep the busses running near me but the stops make no sense and they arent very effective for actually getting anywhere meanwhile congestion is terrible and the only solutions appear to be expanding roadways and intersections
374,anti science yeah no fuck you not being signed up to your ethical agenda is not anti science animal products increase risk of death from multiple causes by anywhere near million deaths a year no so point does not apply since you mentioned the who their website roomquestions and answersitemcancer carcinogenicity of the consumption of red meat and processed meat says the number might be point does apply its also affecting climate change climate change is point your claim here is actually about air pollution from arable farming as far as i can tell however that is a fair point that i hadnt considered and is another issue with intensive meat production that requires large amounts of cropland to support it id say that the answer there is more responsible arable farming to grow those crops though point does apply an animal based diet is more expensive people arent spending of their income on meat your second im not reading one from vegan food and living thats clearly going to be biased link also says could be cheaper but the main difference here is that there is no meat dependency that is forcing people into that choice they are choosing to spend that extra money because they like eating that food point does apply to all of food production greenhouse gases are from animal products while providing nowhere near of the calories and what proportion of that is from intensive farming you didnt even contest the point i made there so my question maybe should have been worded differently i assume people are already reducing intake of animal products based on their morals and why they are here some even vegan so im guessing this is a vegan friendly place i guess that would have been a better thing for me to say yes it absolutely would have been a better thing for you to say there is an analogy to be made here like car dependent sprawl and stroads in city centres intensive farming for meat production is a bad thing with negative effects and should be discouraged many people can improve their lives and environmental impact by reducing how much meat they eat veganism is analogous to some ridiculous ban all cars immediately and you shouldnt use asphalt roads because theyre car products position edit and now look youve dragged me into a stupid argument about this unrelated issue im going to stop replying under this post now
375,no no one has said that and youre making straw man arguments at this point public transport doubles your commute due to car dependency its the amount of traffic less with public transportation that causes long commute times your job wouldnt be far to begin with car dependency is what causes your commute to be that long traffic road expansionsconstruction and more cars is making your commute over minutes more with a bus abolishing car dependency entirely would allow jobs to be brought closer parking minimums less roads etc public transport would also have more priority and efficiency without car dependency your entire problem is tied back to cars
376,jesus christ id start organizing to create some roadsidewalk hazards i guess nothing beats direct action but it might be tough to work out something thatll improve the sidewalks in the one way without also causing problems for people in wheelchairs and the like
377,i think the danger is a personal choice to make really depends what someone is willing to sacrifice a good portion of accidents stems down to bad driving and people not wearing helmets i went overkill on my helmet and riding gear and i reserve my speeding to back roads i personally know are empty and only on special occasionscelebrating an a on a calc test
378,yeah no fuck you not being signed up to your ethical agenda is not anti science not being vegan doesnt make you anti science and i havent claimed that it does denying those things apply to animal products is though because science tellsshows us that they do apply by anywhere near million deaths a year no so point does not apply since you mentioned the who their website says the number might be so deaths only matter if they are exactly million you also have to look at indirect deaths through heart disease etc which consuming animal products increases the likelihoodrisk of plus ptsdsuicide of slaughterhouse workers etc climate change is point your claim here is actually about air pollution from arable farming as far as i can tell however that is a fair point that i hadnt considered and is another issue with intensive meat production that requires large amounts of cropland to support it id say that the answer there is more responsible arable farming to grow those crops though you cant do it responsibly on a large scale when using such an inefficient food source animal products though even if you do it as best as possible for animal products you are still growing multiple times the number of crops you would need to if you didnt consume animal products its still a big impact people arent spending of their income on meat your second im not reading one from vegan food and living thats clearly going to be biased link also says could be cheaper but the main difference here is that there is no meat dependency that is forcing people into that choice they are choosing to spend that extra money because they like eating that food but that doesnt matter maybe i worded it weirdly or you are misunderstanding it doesnt matter if the figures are exactly the same the arguments the reasoning is the same apologies if i caused the confusion i was trying to say that the arguments are the same i wouldnt say its meat dependency in the same way as cars but up until a few years ago that would be considered the case veganism is becoming increasingly easy something it seems like people in this sub wants for cars just because veganism is further along doesnt mean it isnt comparable i assume you wouldnt abandon your principles regarding cars if other modes of transport become easier and also the link uses a study its not just the opinion when directly compared it is cheaper than the cheapest meat but it can be a similar price if someone goes expensive on the vegan products meat is not cheaper than the cheapest plants even calorie for calorie or protein to protein and what proportion of that is from intensive farming you didnt even contest the point i made there intensive farming makes up the vast majority of animal products it has to with the amount of people in the world if you are against intensive farming but for the consumption of animal products then you either think that only some people should be allowed them or everyone has to be limited to like portion a week veganism is analogous to some ridiculous ban all cars immediately and you shouldnt use asphalt roads because theyre car products position its not at all veganism is against animal abuse stopping consuming animal products only because of the environment would be your example not veganism edit and now look youve dragged me into a stupid argument about this unrelated issue im going to stop replying under this post now i stated a fact and asked a question about this sub which you decided to respond to by denying science dont see how i dragged you into it
379,that would b cool however car dependent cities in the canyons are kinda where the good roads are at near me
380,yeah its a real issue where i am one of the closer and older of seouls suburbs things are really bike friendly at all but i get around fine without a car by just walking public transportation and an occasional taxi the hikingwalking path system is wonderful which people do use for bikes as well just if you want to go anywhere besides those paths on a bike youre mostly screwed for example if i go on foot im a long distance runner to my friends place in western seoul approximately half of the way there is along riverstream side paths and only half along sidewalks i could do go nearly of the way through a major city while avoiding car roads entirely if i was willing to take a major detour and follow the han river paths
381,fuck youre right how about we put down more lanes and highways so the buses can get to your job quicker or we could use eminent domain on some useless businesses to create new roads from your home and work
382,id still choose an electric motorcycle but i definitely would love to see more of those on the road i really like what my town has started doing give pedal bikes their own separate lane with a divider on the faster roads in some spots and slapping an electric charger everywhere ice cream shop nearby gives you a free charge if you buy at least one scoop they took an old s gas pump and converted it to be an electric charger
383,im mostly just waiting for the mods to find us as off topic but if you dont tell i wont tell otherwise happy to help because im pretty rusty myself lessee im going to make some assumptions so please dont take it as a comment if i go over something you already get because hopefully itll help us find where things are sticking also feel free to skip anything you dont need im not checking homework free will vs determinism compatibilist theories of free will are contrasted with strange i know incompatibilist theories of free will incompatibilists say that free will is incompatible with determinism about the material world so thats the big context of the debate how do you reconcile free will and determinism what is determinism determinism is the idea that physical processes are fully caused ie if you know all the preceding steps you can predict the next step think laplaces daemon if youve heard of the thought experiment what is free will one rough way to conceive of free will is whats known as libertarian free will which sums up as a kind of could have done otherwise imagine if you could rewind back from a decision free will is ability after rewinding a choice to make a different one why do incompatibilists disagree incompatibilists say that either free will or determinism is true theyre incompatible with each other if i rewound my decisions i couldnt choose to do different because every choice is determined ie caused by a previous brain state leading to positions free will is an illusion or determinism is false compatibilists compatibilists think both those groups are being overly hasty dennetts phrase free will worth having is a good way to sum it up they take the view that incompatibilists have misunderstood their terms and once you fix that misunderstanding there isnt a conflict for the record i have no idea if there are a different bunch of compatibilists who think determinism can be made compatible with traditional conceptions of free will probably are though it might be interesting to see how youd do that reasons as casuses the key insight for compatibilists like me in the dennett vein there are others but im no expert is that reasons are causal entities the door was causing a draft is a reason because it causes me to close my door free will worth having dennetts point is that once you have that insight you realise that actually peoples intuitions are that they are at their most free when their actions are fully determined when they are completely caused by reasons a my reason for closing the door is that it was causing a draft my action closing the door is fully determined by my reason it was causing a draft contrast b i dont know why i closed the door were immediately suspicious somethings gone wrong with my agency c i had no reason to close the door similar thing but now youre trying to say that someone else probably did it and the final charge is that free will worth having is when every action i take is in fact causally determined only not by abstract brain states but the reasons i have for taking that action xb appendix housekeeping the previous post the previous examples are teasing out different ways you might use the dennettian causal story do i have free will if someone is controlling me with a mind control ray no because my actions arent being caused by my reasons theyre being caused by whatever the properties of the mind control ray are this is just a straightforward negative case a version of i dont know why i closed the door where we get suspicious about whether someone had free will at the time in this case they just dont do i have free will if i do something i have independent reason to do while controlled by the mind control ray no because the reasons that caused the action werent mine this is to deal with cases where say someone mind controls me to force me to exercise yes i had a pretty damn good reason to exercise but as my reason didnt cause the action i wasnt free this is also the legitimately debateable question about whether paternalism inhibits freedom or simply expresses it do i have free will if i do something for reasons that i know i have even if those reasons feel like things i have no choice over yes because the reasons are mine this is the case of straightforward yes but it also highlights a bigger questions about whether we ever actually choose the things we believe i didnt choose to think cars are an insane way to travel in a city i was forced into that belief by every interaction i have with them and my experience of the roadscape with them on it i honestly cant say that i could choose to think otherwise i dont have libertarian free will on this question but i dont think theres anything wrong with that and given the forum here i think youre pretty much in the same boat hopefully you find that all useful though if you dont it might be useful reading some dennett or listening to one of his many videos on it
384,then you should support getting as many people off the roads as possible
385,have any of you ever driven next to an electric bus back in the day years ago you could easily cut in front of a gasdiesel bus if you needed to change lanes now the darn things are so fast even sports cars cant cut them off its nuts but also very cool now theyre almost always on time too because they command the road no one dares cut them off where i live because you simply wont have the time
386,i used to built my cities in any city builder game around busses first get myself enough money destroy everything and lay out some road with busses fill in the rest later
387,you guys are forgetting about these things called rvs you can literally live on the road more or less get in watch tv play video games make a sandwhich take a napwake up and youre in a whole different city plus the convenience of going at your pace and the freedom to make detours as you wish a driverless rv is a gamechanger ive been in the market for one ever since driverless technology became a thing like your front yard could literally be a new city everyday and youre not drivingyoure just living its like camping on wheels
388,good were just cattle to airlines and they are looking to squeeze more people in already ultra compact spaces ive traveled a bit not enough to be smug about but i hate getting to the destination and my next trips are all road trips
389,electric cars are really going to mess it up i drove a jeep cherokee fora mile road trip and flying would have been cheaper if i was alone
390,self driving cars almost as good as having a functional affordable railroad network
391,as an optimization we could have people going to the same location at the same time use a larger shared driverless car so that it costs less is more environmentally friendly and introduces less congestion on the roads we can call ita bus
392,and its not going to happen not in the foreseeable future and problem not in anyones lifetime you will always need to be watching the road with hands close to the wheel for the foreseeable future so no it is not going to disrupt the airline industry i used to read omni magazine almost none of the stuff they talked about in there came true but they needed to sell magazines with catchy headlines
393,i mean if i was willing to take that extra time traveling id already be taking a train or a bus which is often pretty comfortable and you know traffic is still a thing putting more driverless cars on the road isnt going to help that situation no not tempting at all too slow
394,rather than relying on batteries and stopping to charge i think we will see electrified maybe even solar roads that charge as you go sort of like a slot car track but uh nicer
395,with a road filled entirely with autonomous cars you dont have to take other vehicles into co consideration when determining speed limits to the only limit is how much the road curvesthe conditions of the road itself imagine driving mph to get to your destination the dream
396,i dont buy it its a little tempting but im going to drive those drives anyways when i need my car somewhere thats an hour flight from me then im far more likely to drive it otherwise its fly and rental im done in a few hours the people who want their cars in say vegas from la are driving to vegas theyre not flying and renting same for say sf to la or la to sf you can drive that in hours or you can fly an hour any time ive needed my car in la god forbid ive taken it really what does a rental cost me will i need a rental uber works driverless ubers better i dont expect it to disrupt the airline industry were far from there disrupt is a big word give me roads mph and then well talk
397,also are people forgetting that initially airplanes started off with loads of extra room and generally luxurious conditions likely personal autonomous cars will eventually give way to more economical and cramped vehicles on the road with less personal space and as many people as possible per vehicle
398,had the same thought after my most recent flight i cannot wait to take road trips and soak up the scenery take naps or watch tv i dont care if it takes longer
399,i kind of did that last month i had to travel between my home city and survey city miles away but i could also benefit from visiting two consumers along the way at and miles so instead of either taking a single flight and missing two customers or taking three flights bcc each way i did a road trip entirely on ap it was physically tiring to do miles in three days but not much more than flying and way less stressing as autopilot progresses this will make more and more sense even before you can sleep while the car drives
400,ive seen videos of self driving cars swaying off a road because the maps arent accurate enough not gonna trust this technology for at least another years nor should anyone with any sense of self preservation
401,people value costs and time more then anything else more cars on the road will reduce avg speed of traffic and increase time drastically cost compassion at this point isnt really doable since such an option doesnt exist buy im willing to guess that trips of moderate to long distances such as over miles will still be cheaper by air i see this being a niche option that the majority of people will not use since the time it takes to drive vs fly will not be good
402,well have to force dumb people who think they can drive better to stay of the road though force everyone to use driverless cars
403,well we dont have the technology for long distance interstate all weather self driving and even if we did you have to share the road with potential drowsy drivers risk an accident laying full down in bed i dont think so no thanks
404,i hate the airport experience so much ive already gone on multiple cross country road trips rather than fly id probably be a nervous wreck for a few hours while i let the vehicle drive for me butyeah i can see the appeal
405,its not at all tempting eg boston to miami theres no way in hell im substituting a hour flight from round trip for a literal hour ride in a self driving car longer in an ev concept that needs to charge every few hundred miles assuming mpg fuel efficiency thats in fuel for the round trip which is more expensive than the airline once you factor in costs like tolls weartear on the vehicle ect costs aside the time value is too steep devoting half a day to travel over my vacation compared to a full road hours is laughable
406,as soon as they make cars that can travel around mph and a road system that can handle them then im in
407,good they need some competition in the area of comfort but realistically speaking im not sure someone would trade a couple hours in the sky and a couple hours waiting for the flight for a hour drive time taken can be its own form of discomfort that can be worse than cramped seating in the far future when cars can safely drive at miles per hour thanks to road sensors ahead and full automation roadways with point to point self driving cars then wed start to see it impact but right now you really cant be in those vehicles for entire trips and sleeping or something
408,this is awesome environmentally because we are soooooo far from building planes that dont run on fossil fuels flying is one of the biggest carbon producing activities the average rich country person does amazing if we can move away from that as a global society i know were a long way off from complete adoption of avs but once theyre the only ones on the road theyll be able to safely go much faster than we currently drive closing that timing gap with air travel combine that with proliferation of hyperloop type underground highways and car travel is looking much nicer than planes
409,thank fuck i hate flying and road trips are life my two boys and would rather drive then fly if that tells you anything about their flying experiences so far
410,longhaul never shorthaul maybe keep in mind that airplane ticket prices would also drop as tech progress and more efficient engines and planes are manufactured making also convenient its a broad statement it only affects flights from a small range self driving cars are in niche market available in certain countries where gps is available and road maps are accurate if youre destination is covered by roads
411,i just want to reclaim the hour long drive each way to work and back xb if i didnt need to pay attention to the road for that hour in the morning and on my way home i could relax game nap whatever xb it would seriously change my life
412,driverless cars are going to disrupt the airline industry a trip to chicago from west central florida is a hour flight or a hour road trip averaging mph whether im driving or not for me its a no brainer especially if you take into considration the cost of gas food and lodging on the road
413,there was a showerthought on driverless vehicles it aint like in the movies where they will just run you off the road at high speeds they will break for literally everything no matter what so they are perfect to cut in line it all stems from legal liability and all that bs
414,self driving bus i hate how people think that autonomous vehicles are going to lessen traffic cluster on the roads how the same amount of cars will be there make public transportation biggerbettersaferetc and then we can start believing the hype
415,i imagine this will disrupt law enforcement as well since competent driverless vehicles that abide by the rules of road make it very difficult for police to issue tickets
416,the main thing im looking forward to in driverless cars is the removal of human error once everyone has one we can de idiot proof our roads to minimize stops and drastically increase speed limits it would definitely make long trips comparable to flight or train
417,not really because then night time traffic would increase and it would take way longer to get to your destination than flying people seem to think that theyll be the only one using this technology like elons stupid tunnels that only fit one car at a time which means that it would take forever for cars to travel the same distance when compared to cars on a street level road
418,except that it is hugely impractical and dangerous xb autopilots can work in the air or even at sea since there is lots of room and little chance for encountering the unexpected they could work well on tracks where forward back and stop are the only three possible commands but roads are a different matter entirely kids chase balls into streets animals leap across freeways potholes develop where they shouldnt garbage and debris fall off trucks the world is vast and there is simply no way to create a program that can properly anticipate every hazard properly no programmer or team of programmers is going to be able to anticipate every possible road hazard xb one example i use is this imagine youre driving downhill on a mountain pass youre in a standard small sh sedan there is a semi truck behind you loaded down to the gills riding its brakes and downshifting to attempt to slow down on the steep downgrade suddenly a deer jumps in front of your car what happens a smart person guns it and bounces the damn deer off the hood and accepts that hes going to take some damage doing so a fool or a computer with a forward facing proximity sensor brakes and the truck then crushes you to death because it physically cannot stop in time no matter what xb humans are stupid and often make mistakes but at least when a human driver or pilot screws up there is someone to blame a human can also choose lessser of two evils scenarios when driving a computer cannot weigh the moral difference between swerving into an oncomming car or running over a child in the road self driving vehicles are really only viable in known controlled environments otherwise youre literally putting your life and the lives of those around you in the hands of some programmer who has had way too much mt dew way too little sleep and has never seen the terrain you drive in

420,self driving pick up truck place a bed in the bed and youre good for camping mid roadtrip
421,for short distances i still hate the hour trip from indiana to florida even when i road passenger in a rv plus atlanta traffic will probably still be the worst even if percent of the cars are self driving anything hours or less id be game for
422,it might not id rather pay few hundred extra to get there in couple hours i dont want to be on the road for hours even if i dont have to drive
423,i cant believe none of the top comments have discussed the number of people moving by plane vs how many vehicles would be on the road if driverless cars were in enough quantity to actually disrupt the airline industry million people per day are currently flying domestically million total if you include international and at most domestically those are about hour trips coast to coast or far shorter on average my guess is average flight in the us is about hours but i lack official data so each person is traveling hours to their destination per their day of travel hours on a flight will be conservatively at mph roughly miles very low estimate this hours via car would be hours of driving non stop but of course we need to stop for gaselectric charge or for bathrooms and food i figure a hour mile trip by car at mph average would be closer to hours the low average capacity of commercial flights is people can travel miles in hours using airlines million people can travel miles in hours per day so lets say half the current people flying decide to start traveling via driverless vehicles person can drive miles in hours people can drive miles in hours people can drive miles in hours per day xb now imagine traffic is increase by people increasing main freewayinterstate travel congestion by over million hours per day spread out across the states i cant fathom this ever making a dent in airline travel because enough people realistically switched to driverless cars on average wed see significant increase in travel times traffic congestion etc lastly why is nobody comparing airline flight environmental impact and driverless cars environmental impact plane going hours vs vehicles going hours
424,add starlink and have a driving office if this is possible ill likely sell my house and be on the road all the time
425,are you me fuck driving that hour long commute to and from work days a week hours a week from my life effectively vanished into thin air thats hours a month literally days gone a month dedicated to only sitting in a large metal box with wheels imagine that once a month you sit in a room doing nothing for hours except maybe look at pictures of a road and trees and shit and listen to radio
426,and those drive times are going to get shorter once we take humans off the road ai is going to be way more capable of driving at high speed than a human
427,the fun part is imagine induction power in the roads so you just keep driving even more fun if you can create roads that are cut off from out of bounds obstaclesthe car could theoretically go as fast as possible couple that with removing the time to check in for a flight boardingdeboarding grabbing luggage this would be quicker for anything but like cross country
428,phoenix and san diego are a and a half hour drive apart phoenix and los angeles are about hours away by car la and san diego are anywhere from hours from each other by car traffic las vegas is hours from both phoenix and los angeles san jose is about hours from los angeles albuquerque is about hours from phoenix while el paso is only hours away albuquerque and el paso are only hours apart albuquerque is also hours from denver but what about other areas of the country boston and washington are only hours apart there are cities providence new york philadelphia wilmington and baltimore on that route its only another hours to richmond and another hours to norfolk and virginia beach from either location its hours to raleigh thats pretty close to all the large north carolina cities and only hours from atlanta atlanta and jacksonville are a measly hours and orlando is another hours away all of florida is easily accessible that way on a road trip from san francisco to boston you could drive and hit a city within hours of leaving the last one every time san francisco takes you to san jose then los angeles phoenix tucson el paso san antonio houston new orleans mobile birmingham atlanta charlotte raleigh richmond washington baltimore wilmington philadelphia new york and finally boston a similar route diverging between washington and philadelphia could take you to chicago with the same constraint if the us ever gets an electric passenger rail network or a large hyperloop network city pairs like these would be huge opportunities this could be a major problem for any airline they have to figure out how to arrange the network of flights but with demand shrinking even further as the distance between cities also shrinks
429,there also should be a bigger offer of night busses possible they would be like a train but on the road and could have luxury cabins or even meeting rooms the only benefit to a personal vehicle is that it will bring you to your personal destination but a shared ride is by all accounts cheaper and better for the environment
430,especially with the efficiency that could be gained by automating traffic flow and speed you could redesign the vehicle to have fewer compromises on speed drivability etc couple lanes of a highway or dedicated roads that only driverless cars can operate on there are a lot of options to incrementally introduce this tech as it comes closerto being a reality average people could rent a driverless car or spot on a bustrain wealthy people would have their own ultra luxury models be able to use faster calibrated lanes etc
431,were nowhere near driverless cars that dont need constant driver supervision while on public roads though
432,plus you get privacy inside able to set the music and entertainment completely to your liking detour for snacks or other needs or just cancel the trip if suddenly the news says things are bad over there once the roads are entirely self driving higher speed limits will also be likely especially for the highways domestic flights will struggle against such competition
433,except unless every car on the road is also autonomous it would be extremely unsafe to sleep in the prone position in any vehicle
434,you can literally live on the road more or less get in watch tv play video games make a sandwhich take a napwake up and youre in a whole different city so like a train
435,thats when you see robot ai cops patrolling those roads they shoot once and miss nothing
436,trains in the us are garbage because most railroads here are owned by companies rather than the government so anytime a shipment is coming through or whatever they have to wait theres no point in updating amtrak to a bullet train for cross country because they have to go at the same pace as a cargo train
437,that would be great if the freeways where i live didnt resemble the surface of the moon not going to be sleeping on these roads
438,they will also speak to each other about adverse road conditions tree down from a storm road washed out from flood fallen rocks on the road etc
439,and then make it so the thing that carries a bunch of people also flies so it can skip the roads and go in a straight line and arrive near the destination
440,trains are crashing because the railroads are refusing to make the needed upgrades somoney
441,even if cars were operating mph theyll never beat the plane driverless cars will probably only be useful for local and regional trips not bug long road trips
442,but you can see the sights and road trips in general are fun
443,not to mention the impact on traffic the number of cars on the road is already near unsustainable in many places this to me implies massive traffic jams
444,ugh sounds painful to be stuck behind one of these road dinosaurs
445,sleeperbus if only they had a dedicated road section from city to city or special tracks so you dont even need guidance most of the time we could call it amtrack
446,some of us like long road trips though
447,road trips are more fun than the destination
448,the limiting factor in driving isnt physics though you have to drive slow enough that if someone else does something stupid you wont get hurt self driving cars will know exactly what every other driver on the road is thinking and have effectively infinte time to find a solution because their reaction time is basically zero compared to us
449,depends on the vehicle my gfs civic had horrid gearing for the highway so it only got on the interstatemph where as local roads mphit does where as my truck is between gears at and does much better at
450,its not about efficiency its that owning the rails is always going to be a loss that needs to be recuperated somehow if its all state owned that doesnt matter think what would happen if the government didnt own the roads how do you make money from a road tolls
451,thats actually something to worry about as the car drives it uses fuel or electricity which is bad for the environment and they take up space on the road causing traffic congestion
452,im the armrests are slightly lower than the tops of my thighs i cant even rest my arms on them id have to hunch over im also broad shouldered so the backrest is somewhere around the middle of my shoulder blades and if the headrest doesnt extend upwards it stops about mid shoulder domestic air travel sucks unless youre in first class
453,eventually the cars will form their own network that utilizes particular roadways just for temporary relocation while waiting on user and other roadways for actual transportation throughout the area
454,build it into the roads and then just drive in the charging lane for a bit like fzero
455,but you know what by gut feeling i feel like driverless cars going around in an ordered manner will go more smoothly than half that number of humans who refuse to let someone pass merge at the last minute stop in the middle of the road because they didnt want to wait for the next green etc
456,pretty much we can already see now how everything seems to be moving towards subscription models and as real wages get worse and average consumer buying power goes down it will be harder for consumers to afford their own vehicles uberlyft is already bordering on the concept and we know theyre working on having their own self driving cars theres totally going to be a rides a month tier unlimited personal rides unlimited with passengers gold tier we actually clean these regularly theyll probably roll through car washes and detailing stations with contracts to uberlyft on given schedules xb even further expect future laws to reinforce the subscription model as more self driving cars come on the road and eventually become the majority new citystatefederal laws will be passed to regulate the effects of self driving cars and the big companies will lobby for those laws to be more favorable to the companies and make it more difficult to be an individual owner
457,if you spend any amount of time on rroadcam you see over of accidents being attributed to either someone wasnt paying attention or someone was being an asshole self driving cars wont catch every edge case there will be accidents and the types of accidents will change with human drivers deaths may occur due to a human driver falling asleep at the wheel in self driving cars it may be a sensor malfunction failing to detect a person that sensor failure will seem so tragic a human would have seen the person the internet shouts failing to account for the hundreds if not thousands of times a human didnt see as a result of being preoccupied with a text message or drunk or tired or the person was just hidden behind their a pillar blind spot the goal with self driving has always been to severely reduce accidents its not technologically feasible to engineer something thats entirely accident proof but people see an accident and think hey i thought these things werent supposed to have faults
458,i work with autonomous cars they are incredibly smart and have great perception these cars arent something that can be just done as a startup you have to have the best technology both in software and hardware the point of all of this is make it safe remove the human error these cars dont fall asleep get drunk or become reckless you need the money and time to invest in these cars and the technology its peoples lives at risk so its dangerous to try to join the bandwagon and throw cars out on the road edit phrasing
459,this whole thing would get more traction if they would make a concentrated effort to hash out the legal responsibilities involved in these incidents i dont want to share the road with a bunch of assholes who hide behind an army of lawyers strong arming settlements for the hundreds of deaths that will occur maybe also show peer reviewed third party data defending the ass pull numbers the guy who stands to benefit from to the tune of millions of dollars maybe also prove that you have sufficient protections in place for the computer part to secure it from hackers
460,all cars should come equipped with auto driving and an option to go full manual which could be eliminated via software updates we start driving manually if too concerned about auto mode eventually most everyone will try the auto mode to see how it feels gradually gaining familiarity and comfort with the process at some point it is the most common mode used and stats will show nearly all accidents end up being while in manual mode govt make a decision and all new software updates disable manual except for instances where there are no clearly defined roadsgpsetc i just dont see the arizona death as being a big hurdle i am saddened by the loss of life but going full auto is the only way to stop the current k deathsyear we see now
461,a person killed by a self driving vehicle will cause a reaction a thousand times worse than a death by a car driven by a human why because a large section of humanity are terrified of ai machines and fear will drive them to react emotionally regardless of rational arguments beware hubris toyota executives this is a new technology and the main consequencies of what will happen when a large number of self driving vehicles come onto the road compared to a small fraction can have major unforeseen impacts until empirical experience replaces opinion nobody can be certain what will happen in this industry there is a known prediction if a self driving vehicle kills school children on a crossing the world media will give that incident lots of publicity the public and politicians will panic and the industry will take a hammering roll the dice lets see what will happen
462,the reality is that self driving automobiles are already safer than humans self driving automobiles dont fall sleep dont get distracted dont forget the rules of the road and dont make mistakesany mistake is a correctable programming error they also have constant degree awareness and the ability to communicate with other self driving automobiles given time they will also be able to properly diagnose problems with the automobile itself and schedule needed maintenance the overwhelming majority of accidents occur because one or more parties either werent paying attention or didnt follow the rules of the road and this is not a problem with self driving automobiles
463,i think that even if self driving cars are never safe from situations like the uber accident a societal shift will happen when self driving are commonplace for people to have more respect for the road no one blames a train for killing someone if they are on the train line wherewhen they werent meant to be and most of us pay plenty of attention when we are near one i think self driving cars may end up being seen in a similar light
464,reinvent the road first then start on self driving cars not the other way around
465,there is zero guarantee a true self driving car will ever exist or be more than a glorified taxi for pre selected routes on perfectly mapped and pristine roads and certainly they will never replace more than a tiny tiny fraction of vehicles in the near to distant future were ages away if ever from the fantasy of fully automated vehicles the day they build a car that can go from random destination a to random destination b without any help from the driver is not any time soon if ever what well have is lane assist type technology becoming more standard but thats about it
466,hes absolutely right this technology will be paid for with blood like most groundbreaking changes its sad but the only thing we can do is limit the damage along the way in the end the promise of safer roads and cheaper transportation are realistic in a few decades
467,i would rather promote better driving and mandatory drivers education so many accidents would not happen with simple defensive driving and basic knowledge like dont tailgate people and watch the fucking road not to mention all the old ass people who should be nowhere near a ton steel death missile also the lane assists and blind spot indicators and self stopping cars and shit thats just a shitty placebo that makes drivers even worse because they rely on that garbage instead of skill and attentiveness so instead of slapping a fucking hello kitty bandaid on the problem why dont we address the actual root cause of the issue
468,yep automation will one day put me out of a career thankfully human paranoia will hopefully keep that railroaded will i can hit retirement age and collect my pension
469,there are total dolts on the road that cannot be saved by any means even divine intervention
470,this claim of kill hundreds save thousands assumes that there does not come into being new causes for road accidents caused by self driving cars ie solve some human error problems introduced other ai issues at some point in time there is going to be a crash between two self driving vehicles this would be the first case of a new class of accidents not involving human error but ai error the assumption that the fatalities here would be less than existing is for me unproved if every car on the road was ai driven sure generally i would expect it to be a metastable system with fewer accidentsany thing new on the road for the ai could potentially create a rash of accidentsthis could be a software update to another ai weather conditionsa hardware flaw that went undetected
471,what happens if theres a situation where the car has to choose to kill a pedestrian or the passengers of the car who does it pick ie two lane canyon road car driving on outer edge pedestrian on road swerve left and head on collision swerve right and drive off cliff dont swerve and kill pedestrian
472,remember when the automobile represented freedom auto comes from an ancient greek word meaning self its an extension of the pioneering individual and autonomous spirit you could take that car out on the open road and your destination is whatever you want theres noone to tell you cant go theres nothing that can stop you self driving cars represent the antithesis of freedom but a system of control and security
473,yeah but you cant make something as inherently dangerous as being in a car on the road completely safe without making it so insanely expensive and impractical that it defeats the purpose and youll never eliminate all possible risk theres always freak occurrences and far too many variables anyway we already accept far greater risk when we get into a thinly plated metal cage weighing half a tonne or more traveling at kmhr on a narrow road in the opposite direction to other complete strangers doing the same thing with only human reflexes and just hope they arent drunk or mildly distracted and dont turn the wheel slightly and kill you both its interesting that we worry about other people having guns but well happily get on the road or cross a street and trust people not to point their weapons at at us and press the controlled explosion powered go button
474,if they keep auto cars on roads id say its fair game to keep your pedestrian ass alert at all times on the road every other damn creature out there has to why not us suppose id rather die to a machine than a reckless ignorant person although which is worse dying to the odds or dying to human error i suppose both suck in their own right
475,if its still killing hundreds its not road ready would we accept autonomous planes if only one crashed every year as a biker this terrifies me you can make eye contact with a human to make sure they have seen you before you go by i do this at every intersection and driveway how do i make sure a self driving car has seen me
476,yeah i wouldnt want stupid asshole drivers to get hurt because they make up of the road
477,when all cars are self driving it will be a lot safer too because the machine driving patterns are more predictable than human behaviors the machines dont look at phones while driving they dont turn their head at their baby on the back seat they dont nod off or get drunk and they dont cross roads not looking to their left and right they dont assume the other car would brake for them
478,im hesitant about driverless cars mostly because i worry about the day some future terrorist or corrupt government decides to hack into the system and kill everyone on the road
479,i personally want to see most cars on the road driving themselves i get incredibly anxious even just riding in a car and have never had a license because of it self driving cars will have accidents but far fewer than we have with human error there wont be the issue of overly aggressive drivers and these self driving cars wont pull of crazy unsafe maneuvers to save themselves a second or two of time on the road ill feel much safer if the human element is taken off the roads in favor of much less fallible ai drivers
480,theyll save more than that we need them to agree on protocols so they can communicate with one another and route traffic efficiently as well the sooner we get these on the road and get people out of the drivers seat well all be much safer
481,the robots need to pass a drivers test given by the government before they are allowed on public roads just like people do uber screwed up
482,nope sorry not gonna have an ai drive me around and cause a fatal accident i could have prevented and i need my control when i have to dodge other equally safe self driving cars that are on the road ever consider how easy it is for your death to be blamed on a system malfunction on a fast speed highway aaaand yah im never giving up being able to control my vehicle thanks tho xd
483,self driving car kills someone a bunch of engineers immediately go to work to fix the error a human kills someone a bunch of lawyers do their best to put that human back on the road should they fail the human resumes driving drunkhigh while distracted even without a license
484,the whole uber situation in arizona is fucked due to backdoor deals with doug douchey ill admit that much one person dying to an automated uber in two years of testing is an acceptable risk to me look at the pedestrian crash statistics for arizona hell look at the mill ave statistics alone and people are here whining about a single accident in which a pedestrian jay walked on a dark road in two whole years time prior accident doesnt count the car performed an illegal maneuver and hit an uber overturning it in alone the were pedestrian related accidents of which pedestrians were killed where is the outage for these of the remaining sizeable amount required immediate medical attention lets assume followed suit with another the uber accident is of all fatal accidents involving pedestrians in arizona and the outage its generated is ridiculous improvements need to made automation is the answer to traffic congestion general safety of pedestrians and passengers
485,this could be mitigated by putting roadways in major cities underground right now it is dangerous and impractical because of how badly people drive doing this would eliminate pedestrian danger free up huge amounts of space and create walkable cities with the convenience of private transportation
486,the great thing about self driving cars it will force pedestrians to be more aware of their surroundings hopefully if the cars priority is to protect the passenger pedestrians will again hopefully be inclined to think a little more about their own safety and not do silly things on the road
487,im weirdly fascinated at how replacing traditional cars with self driving ones is litterally a trolley problem enmwikipediaorgwikitrolley_problem edit while a self driving car might rarely have to deal with something like the trolley problem im actually referring to the decision to implement self driving cars in the first place by putting self driving cars on the road we stand to save many lives but those cars will still kill a few people likely people who would have lived otherwise
488,yeah agreed the cyclist who was literally riding in all black clothing with no bike lights on that i almost killed this evening didnt seem to grasp the logic of what i was saying when i pulled over waved him down and tried to explain to him that despite him not being aware of how close he came to dying when i pulled out in front of him a decent way but only through sheer luck because all i saw was the car lights a few hundred meters down the road he didnt really seem to grasp the logic of it ps i have no idea how to punctuate that sentence correctly i tried
489,was actually thinking about this earlier after heard on npr a section talking about the recent uber accident in arizona the guy at toyota is not wrong here think about all the accidents involving drunk or reckless driving or road rage every year i also wonder how the car insurance company is gonna survive once the automobile becomes industry standard
490,its not just a matter of logic combine the algorithm with insurance risk and micro targeted data and were not far away from the car choosing to mow down half a dozen shop workers on the pavement to avoid the hedge fund manager crossing the road
491,it also boils down to one problem which will always be there regardless of a human or machine driver you cant fix stupid if you jump out onto the road in front of a car you will be run over regardless of who or what is driving
492,id rather deal with a computer that can always be improved rather than sharing the road with a teenager who is too busy texting while driving or that other driver who is nodding off from sleep deprivation
493,i mean yeah the car wont be a dining table in the middle everyone sits around youll still have to sit in a drivers seat and will certainly have emergency overrides and big loud flashy things when the car figures out the sensors arent working so it would have to be oh the car didnt see and the person didnt see or react i find it hard to believe wed just immediately go to the full extreme of not even having to look at the road a pilot less plane is different from a plane with pilots that has the option to go auto pilot whilst they all sit there making sure everything is working and theyre going the right way surely
494,what about the thousands of other cars on the road that youre on planes can go up and down on a completely different axis than cars can
495,no pedestrians in the sky no pot holes cyclists icey roads etc etc all it needs to do is avoid other planes of which it passes or every few minutes at most
496,on senors is anybody worried about people not maintaining their cars how many have driven around with a check engine light on now imagine people driving around with an intermittent sensor will people pay for repairs immediately or try to coast by will people possibly buy a car they cant afford to maintain and end up with a hazard to the public on the road or will we have to maintain our cars to the highest standards complete with maintenance logbooks day checks etc edit you guys have some great ideas but its not fool proof edit isnt the goal of self driving cars to not have humans drive ever or allow a car to drive an impaired person home sensors dont fail after a drive they can fail at anytime some sensors will fail intermittently or it will pass the bit built in test but display inaccurate information or lets say it fails reverts to manual control and the human being onboard is drunk edit i am a pilot and our airliners have lots of redundancy but systems and sensors still fail and its up to the human to sort them out if pulling over isnt an option which it isnt in an aircraft this is despite having highly regulated and mandatory maintenance ive had airspeed very important become unreliable loss of trim position indication think car doesnt know steering angle generator failures power distribution issues in which a bank of systems fail autopilot and autothrottle failures etc all of these passed their bits before going flying im just providing some food for thought i dont hate the idea of self driving cars but to say automation is always better than a human i dont think tells the whole story
497,is this the story about the lady that walked on the road just as the car passed no one could have prevented that collision
498,i think you need to be more careful around roads buddy
499,its peoples lives at risk so its dangerous to try to join the bandwagon and throw cars out on the road exactly and the fear is that states like arizona are inviting companies like uber to employ autonomous cars while cutting corners on safety http fortunecomuber self driving program troubles like eliminating secondary sensors and then justifying it by saying more lives are undoubtedly saved than lost the argument that some deaths are an acceptable price to pay in exchange for theoretical lives saved is merely a defense of these tactics no cars should be greenlit in the assumption that it may kill some people just because it may not kill as many as human drivers would
500,its clickbait you only get the sensational out of the ordinary headlines like mass shooting omg people dead omg meanwhile literally people died from road accidents that single day and get no mention
501,yes but are you willing to have your car sacrifice you vs someone else if theres a situation that occurs while im driving on a narrow mountain road and i have to choose between hitting someone biking or skating down the wrong side of the road or taking my car off the cliff im absolutely hitting them i dont want to hurt them but im not going to risk killing myself by going off a cliff what if the car is programmed to avoid them at all costs even if it means going off the cliff because hitting them is estimated at a chance of death vs the cliff being a chance of death for you there is no way in hell im willing to get into a car that would choose to throw me off a cliff in that situation
502,planes are not fully automated and have never been they fly in an open space for a bit and land in a relatively busy airport but with a room full of incredibly organised people that make sure things go right so the flying is really all that is automated the heavy stuff is still for actual humans ignoring the technicalities altitude engine management etc planes have about the ability of a tesla to be able to take a car put it on the road and let it drive its self there are so many more obstacles in the way not to mention there are active airplanes in the world compared to about a billion vehicles quite the difference also as of right now self driving cars are not as good at driving as experienced drivers they are actually worse than a drunk driver at this point if you want sources do a google search
503,seems like cornucopian nonsense i dont know how you put a vehicle on the road where the driver cant obey hand signals from a police officer
504,no it isnt i hate when people bring this shit up it makes no sense you make the action which is most likely to lead in no deaths if it fails then you deal with the consequences end of story cars on the road arent stuck on rails
505,it isnt though in the trolley problem the issue isnt tge preference for many lives over few its ending the few innocent through conscious agency that makes pushing the lever immoral imo allowing self driving cars is different everyone on the road accepts being killed by them by agreeing to use them should the law allow that it cant be said that the people in the trolley problem consented to being used as a sacrifice
506,my issue is that people want to make it into a different sort of trolley problem one where the decision isnt between people on separate tracks it is between the people on the tracks and the people on the trolley the question i have is people are freaking out over if people are in the middle of the road and the car an either hit them or swerve and kill the driver that is absurd no one would buy a car that is going to intentionally kill the driver regardless of if it is arguably the ethical solution if those people are in the road where they shouldnt be then bad things happen if a human being was driving on a bridge with no railings and people suddenly emerged in front of them the human would slam on the brakes but wouldnt swerve off the edge killing themselves they would do everything they could not to hit the people ie slamming on the breaks but those people would get hit if the people are supposed to be in the road like say in a cross walk when they have the right of way and a self driving car is barreling toward them then there are bigger concerns about the technology than whether or not it will make the ethical choice i just cant stand the discussion surrounding self driving cars because it just reeks of people trying to be philosophical when the questions arent that complicated
507,agree with this their are huge legal and ethical barriers to removing a human operator who is responsible for the car another thing to add to your list is how autonomous cars will balance the safety of other road users pedestrians and its occupants simply comparing bulk numbers of people injured and killed wont work is it ethical to sell a car that would potentially endanger you by swerving away from a group people in the road should the car being more willing to swerve away from pedestrians in a potentially dangerous maneuver if you are the sole occupant
508,id rather no one drive on the roads than maintain the right to drive for me and everyone else people always drive sub optimally for efficiency too and jams could be avoided with a fully automated national fleet
509,i know im going to get down voted to shit for this but youre the driver its your job to be paying attention and looking for cyclists and pedestrians not everyone is lucky enough to have a car or can afford to drive everywhere and those that decide to take an alternate transportation method shouldnt have to constantly fear death last year almost pedestrians were killed on texas roads alone thats ridiculous im sorry but i cant see you isnt a fucking excuse
510,literally people died from road accidents that single day youre off by a factor of its actually closer to k deaths per year k are pedestrians k are motorcycles and the rest in other types of vehicles theres location age and sex factors to consider as well because the death rate varies wildly among the different fractions of these groupings
511,ya regulation would be good it would be cool to see a driving test with random obstacles and different road conditions like construction zones and ice on the road
512,likelyhood of it not working is still going to be lower than the probability of accidents that come from a random people driving in their own ways on the road with their own disconnected thought processes and lives and stress and anomalies
513,ok that sentence is a bit confusing all im saying is self driving cars arent going to be a thing for the average person not for a long long time if ever they will be gimmicks for rich people to drive around pre programmed ultra safe routes no one is going to have a self driving car to take them to work and the store or a cross country trip the reality of our crumbling road infrastructure legislation and realities of ai and sensor capabilities will prove me correct were not actually making any advances along those fronts in any meaningful capacity machine learning isnt magic like everyone on rfuturology seems to think it is eventually the companies themselves will stop throwing money at this stuff for little return plenty of technology has gone in that direction
514,dude theres no need for trafic lights all you need is a road map with timers so the ai knows when its green the car wont be looking at trafic lights colour lmao
515,i dont understand how you put a vehicle in the road that cant untangle a tumble weed from a wagon wheel
516,the creature behind the wheel should have spotted them but they shouldnt have been crossing a big road not looking at night it is outrageous that technological advance is going to be slowed up by a cretin
517,exactly hit the brake controlled stop no choices anyone who is hit will probably be illegally crossing the road anyways and the car companies arent liable for other peoples high levels of stupid as long as they follow the traffic laws
518,its not going to do that though if someone steps into the road itll brake maybe itll still hit but most importantly for the automaker they wont be liable the trolley example is a horrible example because we already have rules for this on the road and the cars will follow the same rules brake dont swerve unless the roadway is clear the machine will minimize damage but its not going to choose between the mom and baby that illegally stepped into the road and the twenty year old driving in the oncoming lane or the old man on the sidewalk its going to hit the mom at the slowest speed it can and call before the mom and baby have hit the ground and the difference will be the mom and baby are more likely to survive because of machine reaction time
519,id rather no one drive on the roads well we cant just have everyone driving on the side walks thats just irresponsible
520,there is little reason cars should not be in communication with each other like an ad hoc mesh atc network we just need to reach critical mass of ai driven cars the cars who are linked can share data about pedestrians road hazards and non controlled vehicles on the road the software to accomplish that is straightforward but nontrivial to implement even standard driver controlled vehicles could contribute camera data and benefit from a digital model of the road ahead for example to see hazards over the hill or around the curve ahead through a hud system
521,there is little reason cars should not be in communication with each other like an ad hoc mesh atc network we just need to reach critical mass of ai driven cars the cars who are linked can share data about pedestrians road hazards and non controlled vehicles on the road the software to accomplish that is straightforward but nontrivial to implement even standard driver controlled vehicles could contribute camera data and benefit from a digital model of the road ahead for example to see hazards over the hill or around the curve ahead through a hud system
522,gives you more time to do we you want i use to hate my morning commute to my old job it took between hours to get theretraffic vs mins no traffic but even traffic wouldnt bother me as much just the extra cost now im trying to make my travel time work at home but id still like to be driving around instead of driving around unless its off roadingsporty stuff of course etc
523,i think this is precisely where were headed but maybe eventually a step further wherein youll subscribe to a car service like porsche volvo and i think ford are already piloting and youll pay for your usage up to a certain limit youll order a car ahead to be where you want it at a certain time and it will drive itself to you and youll be able to only get the car you want or need for what youre doing commuting to work by yourself smart car sized micro compact taking the family on a road trip big van night on the town sleek luxury car upsides no maintenance potential savings vs ownership once the infrastructure is in place and the processes are streamlined and efficient and the cars are built to commercial standards of durability think of a semi trucks k mile overhaul cycle downsides private ownership becomes very expensive and only the eccentric and wealthy do it imagine how you think of people who own and ride horses for fun now whither racing thats an oversimplification of what could be as the logistics are staggering and the mindset shift away from personal ownership will take a long time but there are so many upsides that i welcome it as long as i can opt out and keep driving my dirty old benzo until it finally rusts into the ground
524,are you high there are literally laws for pedestrians requiring a certain conduct no matter how careful a driver is theres not much they can do if some dumbshit pedestrian runs into traffic or walks out into the road at night like with that auto car incident even in crosswalks for all the talk about bad drivers pedestrians and also especially cyclists act as complete idiots with no regard for their own safety atleast as much
525,but they shouldnt have been crossing a big road somehow people have been crossing roads for as long as there have been roads are you suggesting we all have to stop doing that now because you want a shiny cat toy not looking and you got that informationwhere i mean thats on top of the fact that your average human cannot outrun your average car please be sure and check back in with us when your child gets killed by one of these things and let us know that the little brat had it coming
526,i agree with you but for different reasons i just dont believe people would ever buy a self driving car if it could possibly murder them it doesnt really matter who is in the road because a product that can sacrifice the life of the driver is a terrible product
527,self driving cars will really completely change how we deal with car insurance what might end up happening is people buy insurance for their autonomous car and if an accident does happen insurance pays for it and life goes on nobody is charged more since the risk of that particular car getting into another accident is not increased it stayed the same relative to every other autonomous car on the road that particular cars risk of getting into another accident has not changed since every car would ideally have the same programming were still thinking of insurance in terms of who to blame in an accident but when autonomous cars come around they arent going to be making the same mistakes as human drivers if an accident does happen its almost of the time going to be due to something out of the control of any one car the simplest way to handle insuring a vehicle that simply cannot have at fault accidents is just to pay a flat rate and when an accident does happen insurance pays for the damages for that particular car and moves on if there were multiple vehicles involved each vehicles insurance will pay for the damage on their particular vehicle now if an accident does happen that is at the fault of the cars programming that should be up to the software developer to deal with if a glitch in the cars programming causes the accident that developer is responsible for their own software if an accident occurred due to a poorly maintained vehicle that is the responsibility of the vehicles owner to deal with in that case their insurance provider could decide to raise their premiums because they have proven that they dont maintain their vehicle or they could require regular inspections or something like that
528,it does matter though and if youve ever driven then you know that your life is constantly in the hands of other drivers if you knew all those other drivers would consistently follow all the rules of the road and didnt get tired drunk or angry wouldnt you feel safer from a security stand point
529,yea i think this is correct theres already car subscription services popping up in big cities like vancouver evo cargo zipcar modo etc and one benefit is it means less cars on the road so in the long run we can see less need for parking lots and hopefully less congestion as the self driving cars develop better driving patterns with their ai it will be interesting to see whats done about peak traffic times make enough cars for everyone who needs to get to work for am but cause more congestion or force people to carpool based on pick up and drop off locations allowing for mass transit to remain relevant and reduce congestion
530,ive been hit as a pedestrian times once while still on the footpath the other two times was at an intersection with lights as i crossed with the pedestrian indicator i agree that as a pedestrian its important that you still look both ways crossings and traffic lights with pedestrians signals arent cross whenever theyre you have right of way cross when safe i have seen pedestrians step out on zebra crossings knowing cars have to stop but they dont physically give nearby cars enough time to stop that said i have a visual impairment and while i did look before i crossed i unfortunately missed the car that was barrelling up the parking lane because my brain doesnt really see movement well and i assumed when i saw a car in the parking lane it was well parked he was speeding and in the wrong lane but i did step in front of him without enough time for him to stop i believe that if i wasnt visually impaired i would have avoided that accident so thats kinda on me but also completely the drivers fault for driving in the wrong lane and planning to run the red light the other intersection was completely the drivers fault i was halfway across the road when the driver looked up from his phone saw a green light and just started driving off the green light was for trams not cars pedestrians cyclists and trams had a green signal cars and buses still had red the other time i was walking down the footpath on a small inner city commercial street and a car that was stuck in jammed traffic just randomly pulled to the left to try and get into the parking lane to cut traffic off but he was overzealous and mounted the curb straight into me thankfully the curb took most of the momentum out of the car so i was just knocked over thankfully the only injuries have been bruising and joint dislocations which im prone to anyway the annoying thing is the complete lack of self awareness so many drivers seem to have at their incompetence i can actually legally drive if i want despite my neurological issues with vision i can pass motor department eye exams because they dont test depth perception or movement tracking just can you read text from a few metres away however im not stupid i dont want to become a murderer or a corpse so i dont drive i recognise that just because i legally can doesnt mean i have the skills and ability to do so
531,it shouldnt datafatality analysis reporting system fars every _single_ fatal accident on our roadways has a nhtsa report generated everyone of these reports can be viewed online this includes things like driver and vehicle statistics but condition of the roadway position of passenger in vehicle sequence of events during the accident and whether or not the person was airlifted the hospital and the amount of time it took ive downloaded the fars database and created a program that will allow me to make queries against this data you can ask for example how many times had a car gone airborne before finally coming down and killing a pedestrian times in one incident it involved a pedestrian and his dog walking on a _different_ road that the vehicle departed from anyways as a result it shouldnt be a surprise that we already pay very close attention to vehicle safety and that the number of lives lost given the trillions of miles driven every year will be amazingly low _suicide_ claims more lives in a year than car accidents hell car accidents dont even make the top causes of deathhtm
532,high end you think that will apply reliably to cheap daily drivers really you think that shit wont get hacked and shut down the entire in socal just to entertain some asshole and his friends you think people wont tinker their shit like idiots to make it drive faster and cause accidents as a result you think that when glitches do happen and they sure as hell will theyll only affect one car what happens when someone fucks up the programming on the ford focus and they roll out prone to total failure under some one in a millionthus rather common but not always easy to find ahead of time circumstance what happens when they fuck up some hardware as happens pretty much every year to at least one major manufacturer and the programming doesnt know how to deal with the trouble that the hardware problem causes like an uneven front brake performance under extreme cold while going downhill causing sudden swerve to one side hell what happens when we realize that always put driver safety first or never swerve ends up not actually being a good rule and people die because of stupid programming decisions besides which this tech will not become as common as quickly as elon musk and others think until it can cycle into the secondary market in very large numbers for over a decade while still being safely usable it wont replace the year old hondas and toyotas and old ford pickups on the road so it will be all automated vehicles so road conditions will be less chaotic is blatant nonsense maybe in years maybe if wealth inequality lessens as well in that time
533,no i want people to keep crossing roads for natural selection if you cant do it without getting killed well
534,ai will brake thats it its not going to jump the curb its not going into oncoming traffic to save lives youre right it never happens on top of that there will be no decision making path is obstructed brake if it hits someone a person would have hit that someone and a lot harder and faster and that someone was in the wrong thats of the people who will die to automated cars it will be because they stepped into the road way illegally and the car makers will eat those people alive in the court rooms should they decide to sue with all the data those cars will record the ai will just brake that is all
535,in the path of a runaway train car are five railway workmen who will surely be killed unless you a bystander do something if you flip a switch the train will be diverted onto a set of tracks in need of repair the train will be derailed and go down a hill across a road and into a mans yard the owner sleeping in his hammock will be killed in this situation would you fl ip the switch as usual its broad and vague you dont know that the five workmen made a mistake they work there youd expect to see them on the tracks and you dont even know if it was their choice to be there they may have been ordered to be there you could only justify the kill five people utilitarian view here if you filled in the gaps with information you made up the scenario is almost identical to the original version it shouldnt warrant a wildly different response to opinion polls
536,id like to be able to change the settings based on mood if i had a bad day at work ill set it to hit the mother and baby rather than send me into a tree if im feeling happy and got laid last night then ill take the tree over hitting the little kid chasing his ball onto the road
537,i hate this argument the car will prioritize the rules of the road first that dramatically limits what the car can or cannot do in a collision and the choosing who lives and dies argument largely goes away eg a rear end collision is imminent driving into the sidewalk would avoid the crash even if the sidewalk is clear it shouldnt do it and just try to stop as fast as possible even though it means a collision
538,this trying to force a trolley problem identifier into the ai will only complicate things have it looking for these problems where they dont exist for the rare chance that it actually stumbles into one once all cars are automated and they communicate with each other the only time they will hit anyone is if that person ignores all road rules
539,it will be because they stepped into the road way illegally just making the point that outside of america most countries dont have a crime of jaywalking here in the uk afaik its l legal to cross in any safe place which could make pedestrian behaviour a bit less predictable still youre absolutely right im not sure people really are all that worried about driverless cars though i think the media just wants to give that impression
540,completely wrong even human drivers dont just brake at least the good ones there are plenty of very common situations where its too late to avoid a collision by braking but its still possible to avoid it by swerving into the open lane next to you in fact swerving to avoid a squirrel in the road and thereby losing control of the car so common that its practically a cliche is a variant of a trolley car problem right
541,i would like it to aslo slow down if there are suspcious of it having to brake in the near future for example it detects a group of people waiting to cross the street it slows down enough to avoid pusshing the brake hard if someone decides to jump the same if there is something where a person could hide or in croasroads just in case an asshole without a self driving car ignores the red light a passive driver ai
542,they have no legal means to the driver isnt the one making the decisions the ai is the level of risk would be the exact same between any driver on the road provided the ai is standardized which would certainly be ideal the only reason insurance prices could fluctuate between drivers is because of vehicle value and vehicle condition a car costs a lot more to repair than a car so obviously they would pay more in insurance if someone isnt properly maintaining their car then they might also be forced to fix their car or pay more in insurance since an improperly maintained vehicle is at a higher risk of malfunction
543,as another driver on the road i would
544,its interesting as a thought experiment but has no real pragmatic application thats about it a lot of people like to play philosopher but the reality is the cars just wont get into situations where they have to make these weird ethical dilemmas ive been driving for years and never once had to decide between the blind man walking his dog and the bus stop full of teenagers it just doesnt happen now and will happen less when the cars can pay a million times better attention to the roadway than i can
545,but will there be a real worldroad rules challenge thats the real question here
546,youre reading the words and missing the point if it swerves its going to be a controlled swerve the same kind recommended in driving courses its never going to jump a curb onto a side walk or drive headfirst into oncoming traffic to avoid someone who steps into the road if people illegally walk into the road and there is person on the side and oncoming car with no one even in it the car will brake and hopefully only kill a few of the people who broke the law
547,i think all autonomous vehicles must be hard wired to remain on the road at all times where it knows the conditions and where third parties expect it to be consider instead if a vehicle had air bags mounted on the front then it can just catch the pedestrian and stop in a completely controlled manner whilst notifying the vehicles behind it really there is no reason why a self driving car has to be just a car without a driver a heavy rigid chassis metal shell glass openings etc this form of vehicle may be redundant when the primary operational functions to be driven and not be stolen become defunct we may see a whole new class of vehicle which no longer follows the traditional design priorities and contemporary styling although the constraints of the existing infrastructure will dictate some aspects such as width height and turning radius the rest is fairly open to innovation i can imagine long haul road trains with bedroom cabins and a dining cart or perhaps an amphibious vehicle that can park in the river and survive a flood it could get very interesting if the market stays open
548,thats not breaking the law in most countries in the world you can cross the road anywhere here in the uk so long as its not a freewaymotorway
549,i think the point is they will swerve off the road onto a side walk if the sidewalk is clear of obstruction the car knows that it cant keep driving on there but it would also be able to detect if theres an open space it can safely turn into and brake regardless of whether doing so is legal it wont turn into a crowded sidewalk sure but a deserted one sure why wouldnt they want it to do that
550,ive been in a couple of wrecks that totaled the car i was in i was driving in one and a passenger in the other i had no injuries beyond a scrape on my chin from the airbag and some minor aches and pains i was also once hit by a car going about miles an hour which caused me to roll over the hood i was legally crossing at a crosswalk when the guy turned onto the road without looking my aches and pains were about times worse than my previous car accidents and i also had a concussion which caused headaches difficulty concentration and poor memory for about two weeks and i had extreme anxiety over the idea that my brain might never work the same again i would sure as hell prefer to be in a car that hits a tree than be in a car that hits a person cars are designed to minimize the force of the impact to the passengers and i would rather take my chances that those safety features wont protect me than mow down a person with zero protection knowing first hand how little it takes to cause them damage
551,ive been in a lot of accidents only one of which was an impact at any serious speed the rest were between and kmshour because typically theres time to react just not enough to totally avoid the collision so dodging some kids on the road and hitting a tree at low speed in my mind is more likely than hitting that tree with speed and id much rather the tree than a group of kids the chances of injury to me are low the kids however
552,in canada except ontario youre allowed to cross a double yellow line to enter something a driveway or side road only youre not allowed to cross a double yellow line to drive for any distance for any reason its straight up illegal i checked a bunch of us states and it changes by jurisdiction but of the i looked at have it being illegal
553,absolutely not they will never leave the roadway except under an circumstance of a catastrophic mechanical failure never as part of a decision tree you cannot have cars deciding a path is safe to fly through someones front yard
554,imagine the world in which tired and drunk drivers no longer kill other people on the roads were at the cusp of that though flip side i dont think weve considered how disruptive this will be to people who drive vehicles for a living
555,the op is a known tesla shill and a mod here so ill probably get deleted i cant believe this is already front page and endorsing this as the future and not some incredibly reckless guy risking his life and the lives of others to shill for his carstock yes full self driving will be cool but its so far out and endorsing anything remotely close to reckless non attentive driving like this is undeniably less safe and leads to more deaths than if the driver of these self driving cars were alert behind the wheel the situation here is a look at me jerk on a public road causing other drivers to be distracted over riding his cars safety features and breaking the law so that people like the op can share the story around the internet for virality many will call this hyperbolic anger on my part but really its not because inevitably this will encourage other people to pull stunts like this and the cumulative behavior will inevitably lead to real loss of human life that would not otherwise occurred if a bunch of friggin brand zealots didnt try to idolize this guy as some sort of big brain future hero pay attention in your car and respect the fact that every giant block of metal hurtling down the road with deadly force in public space should have an attentive and sober driver until we have some sort of universal law dictating otherwise get this trash out of here when framed with such huzzah and admiration this isnt the same as me smoking weed at home in a state that hasnt caught up to expectations yet this is some dude doing something dangerous and stupid benefiting nobody
556,the things that drives me nuts about all of these articles is that they blame tesla for what people are doing anyone using a defeat device for their ap hand detection is a scumbag and deserves a steep ticket anyone intentionally thinking they can grab a nap is a scumbag putting people in danger and deserves an arrest immediately assume that the person is doing whatever is happening intentionally there will probably be dozens of people that accidentally fall asleep while driving this week and crash hopefully solo but many will crash into other people there will probably be at least a handful of seizuresstrokesdiabetic shock whatevers this week that cause someone to crash those things are most likely not that persons fault gloss over the fact that not one of these instances being rabidly spread all over the internet ends with a collision much less injury people have so many reasons why they crash some of them may be happening in these videos but everyones knee jerk reaction is fuck that guy for intentionally sleeping he should die and tesla is to blame how about acknowledge that this technology might save you from death if you or one of your fellow motorists has a medical emergency while driving it safely got this guy down the road for allegedly minutes without incident id say thats pretty remarkable
557,were going to see more cars on the road in the middle of the night as people will be able to drive further distances somewhere that takes or hrs to drive to you can leave in the evening sleep all night and arrive first thing in the morning
558,a british comedian said he does this to scare his friends in a recent interview he shuts his left eye and keeps his right eye on the road
559,and also you know because thats still highly illegal turns out until autonomous cars are deemed fully safe for roads the drivers must maintain full awareness of the road
560,im not a futurist but im going to sound like one future caught up to reality the current tesla has full autopilot as in you could sleep in it the issue is that legally tesla cant deploy the technology until they get x number of hoursmiles showing their technology is or times better than a human driver it has fully redundant cpus in the new version not running current nvidia and musk has more or less said this is checkmate the level and precision to which he describes it makes me believe him ive seen him exaggerate claims of doing x before some date this isnt that they have of the driving data collected on the road its not perfect technology you arent either youre a shitty driver its better than you and were going to hit a point where we have to acknowledge that and its gonna be uncomfortable heres an interview he recently did with an mit ai researcher vdevvxkjvi
561,i see these comments and cant help but think this is why people become anti tesla you and your steering wheel dongle should have your own separate road we shall call it the tesla derby freeway
562,the worst part is they are already capable we just need to get the shitiest drivers of the road humans
563,cars will never be fully self driving as in without a manual option but once they are capable of driving without human input itll be nice to turn it on and read or nap for road trips then switch to manual and take over the wheel when you get bored and feel like driving again
564,this supposed autonomous vehicle technology is extremely dangerous we are no where near a truly autonomous vehicle but people continue to behave as if their car is truly autonomous xb cars with partial autonomous systems are far more dangerous than standard cars for the simple reason that the driver is expected to take over in situations where the car fails but the driver cannot be alert and fully cognizant of the traffic conditions if heshe is not driving the vehicle xb there are so many companies who want this technology and they have so influenced our governments that they are allowed to put these dangerous vehicles on our roads be afraid
565,i personally can not wait for fully self driving cars to be the majority of cars on the road so i dont have to deal with all of you fucking idiots anymore
566,i expect by the time my year old is ready to start college that there is going to be fully automated driving cars plug in the address and just go they should have something that scans your head position or eyes to make sure that your at least looking at the road occasionally
567,lex friedman emphasizes that autonomous driving is still flawed and that you still need to pay attention to the road in of the cases where a tesla driver disengages auto pilot they do so because the ai is doing something wrong youtubeodmflhhzlow
568,funny part is its not like hes coming out of a hour drive cross country just some dumbass completely trusting technology probably just got on the road why drive let the car do it play on your phone or even read a book but atleast be awake
569,this is why im against self driving cars and taking actions and advocating for other means of transportation that takes cars off the road because electric and self driving cars do not fix other issues cars cause
570,i just feel any automation takes away from the reaction time of the driver if he doesnt have his hands the wheel and feet on the pedals i doubt he will be able to do much in the event something goes wrong self driving cars are definitely the future but till its completely safe to fall asleep behind the wheel they shouldnt be on the road
571,i find this both fascinating and maybe for lack of a better word stupid i think as a whole most of us humans are morons you can see it happening and im sure other prior events can do the same with the invention of smart phones people would rather answer a text than surveying the road as they drive or on a bike or when walking down stairs or walking in general you can put to the imagination all the accidents that do and will occur i used to joke about this sleeping in cars and now its happening doesnt matter if ai is safer than human driving its like trusting a stranger to watch your kid for minutes as you go to the bathroom
572,how does these cars perform in ultra dense roads such as that of india indonesia or philippines what about the bustling road of vietnam full of motorcycles
573,lets be honest thats the fastest ive seen any car go on the in broad daylight plus is no one questioning the guy recording this while driving with a passenger
574,uhh right more like fucking musk and tesla are confusing idiots with misleading marketing and trying to push the technology out too fast tesla is only at level it shouldnt be allowed on the roads because of shit like this also they should be sued for misleading marketing
575,theres probably going to be significant hiccups before this becomes a truly safe function of a car as long as there are other people driving poorly on the road self driving cars will be riskier than actually driving yourself
576,i really hope he sverves off the road and resolve this problem without injuring other people ill even nominate him for darwins
577,suspend the license for days that act of selfishness needs punishment the road is a place for equality among motorist you cant be alert at the wheel than you need to stay home and rest cupcake
578,ill be curious about what happens with roadway repairs i lot of statescities use fees from driving tickets to fund road repairs and when automatic driving like this becomes the norm those funds will disappear maybe more tollways
579,arent we a long long way away from level also is level complete automated like go to the bar or smoke a joint then call your car to take you home cause i want that road trips would be glorious
580,until all cars on the road are self driving you cant possibly consider falling asleep on the wheel because there are idiot drivers out there who can still cause an accident
581,why do teslas not have a camera to ensure the driver is looking at the road while autopilot is active from the totals of the article i thought it was going to be an article about how dangerous this was and how tesla needs to update their safety constraints
582,being awake should be mandatory only in the near future eventually it should be illegal to human operate the vehicle on public roads because that endangers people
583,my tesla autopilot cuts off if you dont regularly jiggle the wheel on demand so does every car with ap how the driver bypassed this is explained in the article i simply cannot imagine someone truly sleeping behind a tesla wheel well it happened and this is hardly the first time that said i can totally see someone sleeping on a long stretch of road think long road trips i wouldnt do it myself but all you need to do is bypass the nag function easy and then set a timer to wake you up so you dont miss your exit of course once we have full self driving itll become even easier
584,they shouldnt be falling asleep on the road yes thats common sense
585,the simple fact that autopilot will relinquish control to the driver if it encounters something unexpected is reason enough to not do this as soon as that is no longer the case i will personally be sleeping on long journeys but as long as that is a possibility this behaviour should be heavily discouraged and legal punishment given to those who do it because like it or not it is a danger to other road users just because people have done it before does not mean it is a good idea i would be freaking out if i saw that because at any moment something could happen causing the autopilot to disengage and the driver wouldnt be aware of anything even if they wake up they will probably not be in a fit state to drive because they just woke up and have absolutely no spacial information about where other vehicles are until these cars can react to every possible situation these risks are and should be illegal and discouraged
586,more like people are gonna get people killed because theyre not adhering to the rules tesla is setting out and being well human if tesla was being dishonest and saying you can take an entire trip without concentrating on the road at all they wouldnt have added the system of alerts that tell you to get hands on or have autopilot shutdown if you dont listen to them not trying to shill or argue just providing the counter point that people and the driver will always be the weakest link
587,this is true but it can also be true that people kill other people on the road constantly without the help of automation and even with jerkoffs like this automation is way safer than manual driving even in the seminal state its in now you cant argue that its an easily provable fact
588,not gonna happen buddy every last trucking and taxi company is eyeing self driving tech with undisguised greed they will clear the road
589,look forward to when self driving cars are the norm so accidents drop to virtually zero so cars are designed with comfort and entertainment in mind i would work all day friday hop in the car and play games and then crash and wake up in new orleans or chicago or florida for the weekend come sunday when were done partying hop back in the car and sleep and be home in time for monday morning bonus points for these cars being electric and the doctor octopus tesla chargers being standard so it wouldnt even cost anything and it would stop and recharge and then take off again all on its own not to mention the first person to create an affordable luxury electric rv with solar roof and self driving will be a gazillionaire so many people would happily give up their home for a nice rv and live life on the road with a vehicle that doubles as a home and costs nearly nothing to upkeep and allows them to visit anywhere they want and live there on a whim theres so much potential for our future if we can just sort our shit out and stop fighting with each other over nonsense for a while hope i see it before i die
590,ive taken a couple really long road trips last couple of years would be so awesome to be able to sightsee and then nap between stops hah
591,yep this is what im most excited about especially if the cars are electric and have a range of like miles would make road trips amazing
592,imagine the new standard road trip you pick a string of destinations about hours drive apart and wake up in a new place each day the car drives you to the next one while you sleep
593,ahh the great murder of a real road trip
594,my golf is meant to pull to the side of the road when it doesnt detect input however ive tested it mine just turns off lane keep since i guess it just assumes i want to be asleep forever and its trying to save me from the pain of existence
595,not sure about op but we do know the following tesla spends dozens of million dollars on marketing promotional and advertising costs million in k_htm despite not buying traditional tv ads unclear what its spent on tesla hires and pays people to monitor social media sites including reddit and be involved in proactive posting via customer education customer engagement its relatively easy to buy your way into the front page of reddit especially if you moderate the sub youre pushing the tesla subreddit is moderated by the owner of elektrek who makes enough from referrals to buy a roadster
596,and it doesnt even matter everyone involved is now unsafe whether filming or sleeping the driver and everyone else knows this stunt will distract other drivers why because its illegal behavior on the road causing a scene
597,oh woah big revelation their bud did my initial post not make it abundantly clear i was pissed off at tesla zealotry being displayed by promoting dangerous stunt driving are you going to deny the veracity of my post and endorse this sleep on public roads bs or just attack me for speaking with a shred of reason youre obviously very upset that someone is speaking against something you apparently care a lot about tesla cars are pretty neat this hypebeast stunt stuff is trash and youre apparently fully okay with the behavior preferring to attack a random redditor me pka bitchboy now i guess for pointing out that a mod shouldnt use such a reckless video to push for a product they obviously are really into
598,no and i hate to just go straight flamewar on someone but shut up and stop condoning people hacking their cars to sleep on public highways saying ridiculous things like robots can drive better than people is a childlike fantasy tale and no current tech or law should have anyone anyone tesla or not running around doing hack overrides of their cars safety features so that they can sleep while they drive this is so infuriatingly irresponsible and only undertaken by the biggest selfish turds who are trying to use a shared dangerous space to create viral youtube content to go viral on reddit there are hours of the day that you can sleep that dont involve going to bed for a useless minute nap while stunt driving on the sole road tens of thousands of people are using to get on with their lives who are not distracted and have to deal with someone next to them who is literally asleep just like we dont let jeff gordon guzzle jack daniels while going mph even though he won a bunch of nascar races the tech will be cool thats it right now its not and thinking anyone anywhere has the right to pull these behaviors is gross selfishness
599,im putting the blame on the driver and everyone who endorses the behavior and reshares stunt driving especially a flagrantly pro tesla mod who thinks promoting these videos is cool do you not see the cult like tesla owners and other non owners who are delusional tech zealots calling this perfectly safe the person equating them to rosa parks for their breaking of the law obviously youre a big rah rah tesla dude and im obviously ranting against them here but this has zero to do with whether a tesla is a cool car whether assisted driving makes life easier etc it has to do with someone so disgustingly and willfully pranking trolling promoting or whatever web term you want to use to describe an asshole on a highway pulling a stunt and watching a bunch of people promote the behavior online there are other ways to use assisted driving features that dont involve trying to become viral on the internet through safety feature hacking and doing eyes closed driving youd obviously feel different if it was a different brand jesus christ youre pathetic stop trying to gaslight me with this bullshit and deflecting youre agreeing its idiotic but then saying my opinion is wrong andor would differ if it was a different brand well which is it genius am i right or wrong youre proving my point fantastically by going after me and not the driver or person sharing this unsafe crap if i saw someone promoting this same behavior in a ferrari or a geo id say the same damn thing but im not and you can either choose to join the rank of people who think this is cool or join those of us in reality who dont think some rich jerk should make a commuter road their playground to flex and create viral shock content
600,it should be illegal to human operate the vehicle on public roads because that endangers people totally support this because the amount of moronic individuals behind steering wheels is insane but were gonna have to give up the joy of driving around turning the wheel shifting gears and hitting the pedals damn
601,also considering the very small amount of self driving car on the road why do so many of the drivers fall asleep on the wheelat least thats what it looks like so does that mean they would all be dead if they drive a regular car i know people are excited to see something from their dreams in real life but thats not always good these cars are still in the very early stage and if one of these cars crashes in a horrible accident because of distractedsleeping driver people are automatically going to blame the manufacturer when its still their responsibility to drive and be aware
602,the thing is like you said its easier said than done and losing driving jobs has widespread implications beyond the driving industry entire industries are based off of serving truck drivers rest stops gas stations roadside diners motels even prostitutes will take a major hit there is one goal in automation increasing profits for executives and shareholders we have enough of that already we need to be concerned about the workers every once in a while
603,for driving down the road for miles unconscious
604,rural america is still going to wantneed their own truckscars while i suppose you could run a rental service for self drivers here the amount of off roadpoorly documented road will likely require a human driver for quite awhile yet and the vehicles will require much more cleaningmaintenance example if one person fills the bed with firewood and the next person wants to fill the bed with cattle feed someone is going to need to clean the wood chips and bark out of the back between uses
605,apparently an mot is a test that all uk road vehicles more than three years old have to pass each year in order to prove that they are safe to drive the car will fail its mot if we dont get the brakes fixed an mot certificate so like an inspection in us terms
606,to add on this there will never be traffic anymore every car will be tied into the grid and super computers will calculate the most efficient routes for people and their destinations that tie in the millions of vehicles on the road for daily commuters the computer will adjust times based on the flow of demand the cars can move in sequence with each other closer in tandem and convoy lines there will never be accidents unless by natural causes like weather or animals there will still be self drive areas located outside of cities but highways will have a dedicated autonomous lanes that will never be slow or backed up your vehical will sync up to the autonomous convoy and fall in line
607,im just ready for this so i can nap on road trips i didnt even think about the benefits of the seats not having to face forward gaming car sounds amazing imagine getting to play smash with your friends or pokercard games to pass the time if only i had friends to enjoy that with
608,i think youre so right and im impressed with how accurate your comment is i wouldnt be surprised if in the next years self driving cars are being utilized exact way you just described them but what about other non megalopolis towns like my town in south carolina where its no hassle at all to drive minutes down the road to go to workget groceries will even these small towns transition into fully self driving cars in the future
609,in this future what happens to anyone who has to go off road to a farm or somewhere or who needs to transport food water tools etc regularly in areas not covered by internet services
610,cars have to be somewhere if not randomly parked in public or private spaces all over town then they circle aimlessly on the roads waiting to be summoned so we get peak rush hour all the time this doesnt sound like an economic win
611,less traffic this is the one im not entirely convinced on yes certain human caused traffic snarls will be reduced yes traffic can pack in tighter with perfect knowledge of whats going on ahead but i think the number of cars on the road will go way up people will be willing to take more frequent long and arduous trips when they can just sleepgame the whole way or live further from their work when the commute isnt absolutely terrible
612,some questions where will all the cars go when theyre not in use as you probably know car use is a bell curve with highest utilization rates around morning am ishand evening pm ish so when the united states needs million cars on the road at am well still have rush hour traffic but where will those cars all go during off peak times if there are no longer parking lots people still need garages maybe well have smaller ones but you need a place for bikes scooters maybe storage or an easy way to bring groceries into the house maybe this will transform somehow but im guessing people will still like garages in the future and houses without any garage will still be less desirable with more cars on the road roads will become more congested i know self driving will likely allow more throughput and hence more cars on the road at a time but with cars going all over a city like taxis or buses in nyc i think this would clog up the streets making the idea of living closer in still desirable there could be close to double the cars on the road as for every mile a car drives with a passenger it needs to travel back from the commercial districts to the residential districts empty streaming a car wont be that much cheaper than a taxi is today at least in big cities taxi drivers for example are often immigrants and actually make about minimum wage so maybe half of the cost of the fare goes to the driver the other half goes to maintenance gas credit card processing insurance depreciation or rental of the vehicle etc to replace a minimum wage driver can take expensive tech obviously self driving will be cheaper but not dramatically cheaper maybe of the price of a taxi would be my guess it will certainly not be the cost of owning a car thats for sure poorer people will continue to prefer public transport such as busses and subways this doesnt displace that the streaming service you describe will be a premium service to start with as for people that are just wealthy enough to buy a car owning a car can be as cheap as k per year plus all the other additional costs like gas and maintenance being the primary two that dont really decrease per mile driven and could increase slightly also without parking lots vehicles need to use more gas and will have more wear and tear to get back to its base or docking station so a new kia that leases for per month today would cost more if self driving tech were added in addition to self driving tech the vehicle would need to have better communication tech and there would need to be a backbone of maintenance guys to change tires or fix various issues that can happen and a used kia would cost even less i cant do the exact math on this because it is too complicated but overall im not saying it will be a little cheaper in some situations but it wont necessarily be that much cheaper
613,unfortunately in order to have a situation where there are virtually no accidents manually driven cars will need to be banned which is going to be a long long way off in addition roads will have to be in exceptional condition with markings painted properly in many parts of the uk where i live the roads are in such a terrible state that autonomous cars simply wouldnt be able to work unless someone comes up with a much faster and more accurate form of gps to avoid the need for markings to be detected by cameras sadly i dont think this fully autonomous car era will be seen by anyone currently alive today at least in the way were discussing where driver liability can be completely removed from the equation
614,so many people would happily give up their home for a nice rv and live life on the road with a vehicle that doubles as a home hah you didnt read judge dredd did you this is an exact description of a mopad
615,i imagine at some point cars will charge whilst still driving on the road possibly from induction charging or possibly sap energy from another charged vehicle or a vehicle that is specifically designed to charged your car on the go a little bit how jet fighters are refuelled in the air
616,roads can have induction chargers so that cars dont have to stop
617,unfortunately solar panels on roofs are not physically possible with the way current roads are designed the surface area on top of a car isnt nearly big enough to capture enough sunlight to generate sufficient power to move a car cars of the future would have to be super light weight with very large roofs unless roads are completely redesigned across the world im afraid this technology wont happen within our lifetimes
618,once cars are fully automated you could potentially work from home the whole day already on the road
619,that wont be sustainable unless we completely restructure major highways and roads once this is the norm if everybody chose to take their self driving cars long distances in lieu of public transportation there would such an insane amount of traffic even if its comprised entirely of self driving vehicles i may be in the wrong subreddit to be preaching this but as the population grows and carsroads become more accessible public transportation is the future not self driving cars
620,look forward to when self driving cars are the norm so accidents drop to virtually zero so cars are designed with comfort and entertainment in mind im worried that wont happen in our life times too many people are so invested in driving the cars themselves while humans are still on the road we are still going to need humans behind the wheel of self driving cars because only a human can understand how fucking stupid a human can be you know how old people are with tech someone is going to smash their car because it took a different route to the one they are used to some boomer is going to refuse to update their car and then blame the tech when they get hit with a zero day that has been known about for years we still havent managed to ween most people of wiping chemicals on thinly sliced tree as a means of communication
621,self driving cars are great and i cant wait for them to be accessible for everyone but we should really start with good high speed rail and subway systems like other developed countries theyre already available and they will always be a lot more sustainable and safe in a sustainable future cars should only really be needed as a luxury for special trips cars and roads simply take up far too much resources
622,yeah thats the one gripe i have with all this it fixes a problem that could be fixed way better or creative without cars even in an electric car driving by yourself is still somewhat of a waste puts more pressure on the environment in terms of materials asphalt and small particles from your tires and the production process of you energy also youd need to rework the entire infrastructure for this to work you need even more dracononic laws than the ones you have around jaywalking and countries with a cycling culture will have the dilemma of either creating barriers for them or allowing wildcards on the road a city like amsterdam is a nightmare for cars like that because of the unpredictability still the current mortality rate on bycicles is quite low and mostly concerns elderly who fall and then die of injuries i fully support the plan to have self driving cars become the norm on freeways but i just hope we can think about other stuff than cars
623,im putting the blame on the driver and everyone who endorses the behavior and reshares stunt driving agreed although i am guilty of taking pleasure in the subreddit ridiotsincars and rconvenientcop to be fair id like to see less post on it for the sake of humanity obviously youre a big rah rah tesla dude im more of an anti fossil fuel dude since ive had enough with harley davidson bikers spouting loud pipes save lives and the germans automakers whom are literal convicted frauds for designing the absolute best emission cheating hardware and software i know its a hyperbole hatred but its the internet so i can vent i guess beside it just happens that the best ev is also spearheading on av there are other ways to use assisted driving features that dont involve trying to become viral on the internet through safety feature hacking and doing eyes closed driving you and i can blame teslas marketing and misused of the term autopilot when it comes to the ordinaryaverage joe as their interpretation can be optimistic as you have said it yourself youre agreeing its idiotic but then saying my opinion is wrong andor would differ if it was a different brand well which is it genius am i right or wrong youre proving my point fantastically by going after me and not the driver or person sharing this unsafe crap just going off what other redditors have pointed out regarding your posts history beside we can agree to disagree but as i see it the person sharing this post or the pro tesla mod had no wrong doing you can either choose to join the rank of people who think this is cool or join those of us in reality who dont think some rich jerk should make a commuter road their playground to flex and create viral shock content im a pessimist i dont think avs should be benchmarked against human drivers but human drivers especially na ones should be held up to a higher standards a riced up honda civic weaving in and out of tight spots in heavy traffic could be more research is needed probs more dangerous than a tesla on autopilot besides senior citizens might benefit from autonomy the most as it enables their freedom for longer while posing as lesser hazard on the road
624,ummm its intentional bad driving and its creating a safety hazard however small it might be which is illegal specially on a public road with other people that risk being injured if you are knowingly causing traffic to not be smooth on purpose you are doing something illegal
625,yeah i think ive said else ware that like the internet rural america and rural anywhere is going to take longer and the tech needs to advance more before theyre adopted into the fold in the mean time theyll have access to cheap parts and cars presumably as people in cities abandon them as for firewoodcattle feed wow i mean isnt that basically a work vehicle at that point i wouldnt class that as a part of this train of thought at all if youre using the vehicle for a job then a subscription service definitely isnt for you in fact id even scale back the whole concept to only be applying to urban living or commuting between urban centers and strictly for commutingrecreation i wouldnt have an answer for work vehicles or rural living other than eventually itll trickle down but that doesnt sit right id guess for work vehicles which are specialized and used but also need to visit rural communities youd have to have a normal car which is also an auto but it would probably be illegal to use the manual drive in a city for traffic management purposes so it would automatically go into auto mode x miles from city and would allow manual override for rural areas so you can access off road areas
626,i could see hundreds of cars parked on the shoulder of the main roads but i dont see an issue with that if most cars are automated
627,by the time this is in effect manual driving banned only autos on roads well probably have printed organs with drone delivery and itll be a solved problem
628,alternatively mobile wifi and no need to focus on the road means that you can do work on the way to work and be able to clock in the minute you get in your car meaning you shave off hours of your workday and then youll be expected to work hours a day for of the pay so were back to square one
629,not gunna happen while there are other human pilots on the road youll be strapped in until manual driving is illegal
630,but then theres the question if a self driving car only has options go onto the curb and hit a pedestrian or slam into the back of a car what will it choose either way someone gets hurt but i dont know if i would want a machine deciding who gets hurt the scenario is of course possible however getting to that scenario will be x more rare with self driving cars they arent going to put themselves in those situations nearly as much theyve got x better reaction speeds can see x further and eventually will be able to communicate with other cars on the road as well there will come a time when a car will jerk hard to the right in the middle of highway traffic because someone just jumped off or threw something off the overpass and as it swerves into the other lane that lane is already clear because the car that was occupying that space got the message and itself slowed down and swerved to make room for your car avoiding it and all the cars for feet behind it also adapt their paths and suddenly start navigating around the obstacle or person in the road while automatically alerting ems or police the exact location with a picture of whats happening and all these vehicles will do all those things faster than you as a person could even register with our tiny little monkey brains that something was falling into the road any fears i ever had about a car making these decisions were soothed the first time i saw a compliation of self driving cars avoiding accidents i just put myself in the position of the driver and think how would i have handled this would i have crashed and the car is reacting before i can even suss out whats happening on screen or see anything
631,i acknowledge that there are diving situations and factors that create genuine accidents but there are many that happen do to ignorant people doing dumb illegal shit sure but a self driving car is better than a human at dealing with those people too p all the stuff you had to do and the things that had to go right for you to miss having an accident last night the autonomous car would have started handling faster seen coming from further away and reacted better and more safely accidents will still happen until we outlaw humans from public roads which is going to come because humans are terrible at driving but self driving cars will reduce those accidents and the severity of them dramatically
632,or just pull over and tell you to focus on the road lol
633,i do hate driving but thats not the main reason why i hate cars its because they make everything more complicated even if you dont drive now cities are made for cars roads are six lanes wide crossing is a nightmare sidewalks are empty because who can walk there etc they really do ruin cities im fine with highwaysmotorways but even in that case i prefer to just hop on a train where i can actually walk around have services bathrooms food etc if if were for me the only vehicles on the road would be ambulances police firefighters and deliveries i really do think amsterdam got it right
634,fewer cars on the road how people generally want to use the same roads at peak times either you have the car in your driveway and waiting for you or you are told sorry the car wont be around to get you until we will have to reorganize our economy into multiple groups such that you have rolling start and end times and now instead of parking in the city and finishing the trip an hour sooner those cars need to be sent out to the country to park more car miles consumed each day means more traffic and now instead of current parking lots being idle space they will have new buildings with people needing access to them so we doubled the population density of the city generating even more car miles of demand for the same roads inefficient and wasteful if not convenient the story of environmental collapse
635,traffic will flow better but if there are more cars trying to use a road than the road can support then traffic will slow down
636,i dont mean to be rude but you do realize places exist that arent cities right place like the us _cant_ have public infrastructure that allows travel for everyone theres just too much distance and too little population involved to have a bus route along every shitty dirt road in rural america
637,as a virginian i couldnt agree more screw i take back roads to avoid it lol
638,as someone who drives every day sincerely fuck also va drivers seem to not give even the slightest shit about traffic and road laws i dont get it ive lived in a lot of places across the us throughout my life and va tops it with the most selfish and careless drivers ive ever seen i even saw a guy wave a baseball bat out of a car at someone who beeped at him when he cut them off turning from the middle lane mad max is an accurate description safe travels kind stranger
639,humans fuck up like all the damn time also we only have two eyes that can only focus in one direction at a time a self driving car has like cameras some have infrared or lasers to detect other vehicles and objects in fucking fog and other atmosphericenvironmental conditions including the constant environmental condition of dumbasses like cletus who thinks a little rain re downpour doesnt warrant turning on his lights conditions no human can see through or should attempt to drive in the problem is you get idiots who see one self driving crash even at no fault of the car itself and say see look they are so dangerous no grandma youre fucking dangerous with your failing eyesight muscles and heart conditions that make you a ticking time bomb on the road but nobodys trying to shut you down
640,rural areas here in europe are also more car centric because thats just how how it is in low density areas but bigger us cities have no excuse for the lack of well working public transportation releasescb html rural areas cover percent of the nations land area but contain percent of the population about million people for about of the population whatever one needs to adjust to get realistic numbers good public transportation would be more of a life changer than self driving electric cars that can increase mobility and make life easier in a lot of instances it also means you need fewer parking lots and because there are fewer cars on the road you also get fewer accidents if you dont have self driving car saturation and cleaner air there are people andor jobs that really depend on cars but for the rest of us and also for those few who really need cars a well working public transportation system is much more useful a developed country is not a place where the poor have cars its where the rich use public transportation gustavo petro mayor of bogotá
641,what does your virginity have to do with road hazards
642,what does your virginity have to do with road hazards
643,these back roads you speak of would you describe them as country roads and to what ends would you take them
644,yeah but if you run out of juice miles from the next charger or off the main roads etc waiting a few hours to get moving again without having to walk for gas or getting a tow would be nice how many mileshour could be sustained on average
645,the equivalent to that in current day is to have a gigapack battery to store any excess generated during the times theyre staying put in a location and use that during the times they are driving that few hundred miles plus battery packs would probably charge a whole lot faster at charging stations and you could even conceivably trade your empty battery pack plus a fee for a pre charged pack down the road if that ever becomes a thing so you could literally drop in swap out the pack and go like formula one cars
646,literally most people are horrible drivers about in every i meet on the road can i actually say wow this guy knows how to drive and i can just chill behind them
647,nah im no better than the average driver were all collectively terrible at it because were all constantly distracting ourselves self driving cars are gonna be hard for some people to accept but a lot of us understand that it will be easier for everyone on the road when all the cars are more predictable
648,theres always that unicorn driver that i love sharing the road with im not a perfect driver by any means but i take pride in doing it as well as i possibly can always trying to be steps ahead of where i am while keeping that ratio of defensive and offensive driving the amount of people that just clearly dont give a fuck about the safety of everyone them and comlletely lack the situational awareness of the k pound death missile they are piloting scares the ever living shit out of me sometimes
649,we should also realize that somebody died for a part of them to be harvested if the person driving never died then now you have at least one person who is gaurenteed to continue a healthy life whereas the organ recipient would still have a long and risky road to recovery if the driver did die hell if the driver died his body could still be unuseable due to the nature of the crash net gain
650,when the road ragers explode from being forced to go the speed limit i think organs will again become available
651,seems like another moot point to be against electric cars oh they dont make a noise though oh they look stupid but they have limited range the more electric cars on the road the safer the road is thus less car crashes thus less organ donations
652,dont worry a group of humans wont follow the self driving cars fad and will vow to kill all those on the road who does
653,would think most of those come from donorcycles if self driving cars become a real thing will motorcycles be allowed on the roads i would think that would cause issues
654,seems to me like the article is more like a very brilliant backward sell job for driverless cars it remains to be seen how many lives will be saved and frankly can someone tell me what corporate industry actually cares about less road fatalities in the first place other than using it as a great selling point
655,is it just me or is anyone else going to avoid these things at all costs when you see them on the road like yo terminator on the road
656,its cost to put a person on a road but its a flaw if any death comes out anything sure seen the ai working an will kill us
657,its cost to put a person on a road but its a flaw if any death comes out anything sure seen the ai working an will kill us
658,yeah but were still saving the same amount of lives instead of saving person in a hospital we save person on the road
659,once self driving cars hit the roads at scale development within d printet organs will have surpassed the need by far
660,getting more transplant is primordial regardless but even if you take for granted self driving cars are going to entirely remove those accidents how long until all regular cars are off the road and donations take a hit
661,i love driving hate these self driving cars really hope i dont have to have one in my life time back on topic im sure the organ thing will balance out with less road incidents and it might encourage development of synthetic organs which is the main issue imo
662,people dont yet realize how much self driving cars will change our entire planet globally s if not s of millions of people are employed in logistics a good majority of those jobs will disappear in years then theres less road fatalitys traffic will be much faster as more and more adopt them and most importantly i can take a nap on my hour drive to the office both ways
663,we dont even have a large number of them on the roads and are already concluding that it will reduce accidents thats not science its wishful thinking lets see how humans and self driving cars pilot on the roads together before we jump to conclusions
664,while i agree i think its important to note that people are still potentially going to die the difference will be that the deaths will no longer be those bad luck road incidents that happen in a flash with no real lead up but rather sick patients in hospitals that have been suffering from some sort of geneticorgan problem in this small case were no longer saving lives were preventing accidental deaths
665,im thinking that the first wave of self driving cars will be able to deal with motorcycles motorcycles are already in the roads they wouldnt be able to put cars on the road that completely ignore bikes more self driving cars will make motorcycles much safer to drive
666,thats true bikes rain animals on the road a morbid way to look at it but true
667,since we are jumping to conclusions with this article to begin with im going to speculate that self driving cars will lead to an increase in crime unless by the time they are the majority of cars on the road they dont implement cameras running and a backdoor for the authorities to disable your vehicle at any time
668,no it wont a huge part of the population cant afford a new car or wont trust a self driving car and will hold out as long as they can you see cars over fifty years old on the road regularly not common but they are out there cars are very common
669,im going to school in the auto industry auto mechanic currently and honestly i dont see me being able to pull years and retiring working on internal combustion cars give it years and alternative fuel cars will make up of the vehicles on the road the thousands of oil change and lube stations across the country will struggle to stay relevant gas stations will have to adapt and some will likely go under and car dealerships whom make most of their money on warranty work not car sales will have to shed some weight too if we cant find gainful employment for the millions of people now who are working in soon to be obsolete fields then small ton america will look more like detroit michigan when the plants started to close and the drugs and gangs filled the vacuum
670,people are idiots once road in a car with a guy and we just got out of a movie and there was a giant parking lot and car like ft away dumb thing almost tboned the one car in the parking lot
671,fully autonomous cars still have a way to go both from a regulatory standpoint and a technological one they dont do so well in the rain poorly maintained roads or the snow even once thats solved regulations need to be updated by agencies that are perpetually in the past
672,one of my friends did this when i was with him we were in parking lot and he was just cruising towards this mini van it was directly in front of us at complete stop probably feet away at some point i said hey theres a van there his response what van crunch broad daylight too i dont know what malfunctioned in his brain but i never let him drive my car after that
673,my pet theory is the only reason motor cycles havent been banned on roads is for the purpose to keep getting organs
674,i believe everyone has the personal right to splatter themselves over the road in any way they see fit the fact im on a motorcycle is arguably better because i likely wont cause lasting damage to anyone else on the road
675,sure but because of your choices not because its impossible a couple of years ago i was staying with some friends at a camp site the road that we turned off of to get to it is a very dangerous road statistically speaking where many deaths occur while we were sitting around the campfire drinking there was the very distinct sound of two motorcycles zzzzzzzzzzzoooooom zzzzzzzzzzzoooooom crash two of my friends and i hoofed it down to the site of the crash to find that two motorcycles had come up over a small rise at over mph on a mph limit road and hit a car that was turning into the camp site we were staying both of the riders were obliterated basically meat but the driver and passenger of the cage were also in pretty bad shape the passenger was beat all to fuck blood all over him but conscious and the driver was insensate with injuries he could groan in what seemed to be response to shouted questions and had to be air lifted to the hospital close by yes you have to be being really fucking stupid in order to hurt a lot of other people on a motorcycle but it can be done edit article about the crash http supply more information in fatal glenn highway crasharticle_eaceebc e e afc cefhtml
676,hecker and johnson were apparently part of a small group of motorcyclists flagged by anchorage police earlier that evening when a trooper spotted a group matching the description he turned around and tried to stop them a single biker pulled over but the remainder of the group continued two motorcyclists believed to be hecker and johnson peeled off and went north on the glenn highway where they collided with the odyssey near echo lake peters said they bolted from the cops to avoid a ticket and ended up as road paste fucking tragic stupidity
677,it would be nice if there could be autonomous only roads i imagine a lot of the risk is from detection errors having a standard signaling protocol for cars to pull exact data about their positioning and entities surrounding them would be a huge advantage makes the ai driver extremely simple
678,i must disagree with the articles pronouncement of what we need to accept the burden is on the technology developers to clearly demonstrate that their design is better than the status quo enough better to justify the added cost in the earlier days of self driving cars there was a wholly unwarranted presumption on the part of many that self driving cars were going to be absolutely safe and the general public is slowly becoming educated on the limitations of the technology if you really understand how deep learning systems operate youll know that theyre a total black box that cannot be verified to operate properly by any manner of proof its been demonstrated that changing of even a single pixel can change object classification decisions its been demonstrated that pasting small images of other signs in the blank space of signs can cause them to be misrecognized because the black block deep learning recognizers are designed to read signs at a variety of scales in the recent uber case a software failure caused the perception of a pedestrian obstacle in the middle of the road to be effectively ignored all this technology is also going to cost money itll make cars more expensive but the ability to drive away from the destination enables cars to be shared which can greatly affect the actual cost of ownership the number of cars on the road and the occupancy and eventually the need for parking spaces nevertheless if the added cost of the technology isnt balanced by a decrease in the cost of killing and maiming drivers passengers occupants of other vehicles pedestrians and bystanders we should be highly resistant to accepting these products thats not to say its the way its going to happen people were so in love with their cell phones that they failed to resist the temptation to use them while they were driving exacting an extremely high cost in lives lost and injuries that persist to the present day users are paying the price of this in their automobile insurance cost but these costs are not redeemed by the companies responsible for the manufacture marketing or sales of cell phones so far cell phone makers havent been obliged to pay for a failure to make their products safe regulation has encouraged makers to add facilities for hands free use which has not yet been proven to make them safe to use while driving indeed studies to date suggest that users still become too cognitively occupied to safely operate a vehicle and a phone together current half driving cars on the market present another danger particularly given users penchants for operating them beyond the stated capabilities defeating safety systems such as by pressing an orange into the steering wheel and so forth theres been clear evidence that reducing the drivers workload with these systems makes the driver less attentive to the task rendering them unable to assist the half driver when it malfunctions or needs to pass control back to the driver unlike airplanes where there may be many seconds before an autopilot controlled plane becomes unsafe or uncontrollable the geometry of the driving task demands sub second responses to unusual conditions
679,the humans that get killed by self driving cars are most likely to blame the technology is good but human error will always be a factor in road deaths weather driving or not
680,why does everyone just assume things are secure and wont ever be used maliciously we cant even keep hotel door locks from being hacked or a a simple database with peoples information secure but we want a complicated software system in charge of a vehicle this is a vicious cycle every time something new comes out medical tech wifi whatever corporations fail to think about security first they designed wireless insulin pumps and pacemakers with few if any security protocols in place lets put million cars on the road with that same philosophy good idea
681,half a million a year die on the road and nobodys bats an eye kill guy with a robot car and everyone loses there mind
682,complete and utter bullshit if these corporations cant find the money and resources to do this safely then they need to find another business it is absolutely possible to simulate the environment they aim to operate in they just need the data which they should be paying to collect en masse this is no different to developing any other critical system you simulate the production environment and test in it before you deploy to production proper its in the article title they are trying to do autonomous vehicles on the cheap at the expense of human lives by slamming underdeveloped models into production i say they can take their lobbyists and piss off in the interim to reduce deaths on the roads governments need to make it difficult to get and maintain a licence as what passes for driving nowadays is pathetic theres way too many on the roads that have no aptitude for defensive driving for those who agree with the bullshit are you happy to be one to drive one of these underdeveloped models and sacrifice your life for the greater good
683,the biggest concern i have with this is whose life is prioritized in case of an imminent accident lets say a child runs out into the road after a ball or something self driving car rolls up and does not have enough time to stop and the only options are a hit the kid or b avoid the kid at the cost of hitting a tree either scenario it is likely someone will be seriously injured or killed how can a machine be programmed to make split second decisions to minimize fatalities and injuries the kid was really doing nothing wrong but should the passengers be killed for something out of their control
684,i never understand this mentality self driving cars will never be accepted if you are asking people to accept that self driving cars can kill people its like asking people to get on a roller coaster ride but people may die on it randomly but people should accept that risk for roller coaster ride sure you might argue that human drivers have higher statistics of road accidents than self driving cars but youre ignoring that people think that in human driving those who drive properly and follow rules have significantly low risk of being in an accidents and its true too to some extent so theres an element of control here so human psychology has a tendency to think that if i drive properly ill be rewarded by safety pay attention follow the rules and my driving will keep me protected but thats not the case with self driving cars even if youre a good driver it does not have any outcome on how car drives thats like taking away control from the hands of humans its like playing russian roulette where its totally upto luck and not your driving whether youll be killed on this particular car ride or not so everytime you get in self driving car it may be your last ride and you can do nothing about it i think this will be a significant barrier in mass adoption of self driving cars unless they make their system perfect
685,we need to consider it as drivers assistance drivers should always pay attention or pull off the road
686,self driving cars too dangerous for the road motorcycles sure why not acceptable risk
687,nah you shouldnt have to just accept loss of life if self driving cars will kill people they shouldnt be on the road youre an idiot at least with human drivers theres accountability no one is held accountable for self driving cars killing people yet we have the means to make them safe wannabe tech bros like you think lives dont matter to progress lol clown
688,i hope that the author of this shit piece is among the first killed if these toys are ever allowed to freely drive public roads
689,i think most deaths will be due to drivers around the autonomous car not paying attention or having bad reaction times your new tesla just saved you from rear ending a semi who slammed on his brakes but mrs jones whos yelling at her kids while talking on her cell phone and doing her makeup doesnt see that youre stopped so she rear ends you at road speed sending you into the back of the semi anyways
690,the way i see it its going to happen no matter what until all cars on the road are autonomous
691,and one more side effect of complete autonomous driving at least in developing countries one i live in is that lot of traffic congestion can be avoided no one follows lanes here actually on most of the roads there are no marked lanes most of peak hour traffic is due to people trying to outsmart others by cutting to the front of slow moving lanes by breaking away and trying to get ahead of the lines which just adds more to the problem at least autonomous algorithms wont be this dumb they will definitely make the roads safer and consume gasoline or electric charge more efficiently because they wont rev mad when there is traffic ahead
692,still at early stage of development and we can expect accidents which cause by peopletheres alot of dumb ass people on the road and more dangerous than driverless car
693,i wonder how this would be still true in harsher environments eg countries or cities with low quality roads and other hazards
694,itll absolutely kill less people than people driving cars as much as i love ripping up the roads and having fun driving myself weve gotta understand we all suck at it
695,way to casually acknowledge the loss of life like it doesnt matter not like you couldnt spend just as much time testing this on real roads with closed off or simulated ones
696,yep the fact that there are few enough accidents involving autopilot that they still make the news should be an indication that they are safer than human drivers the autopilot is programmed to give a shit about other cars on the road humans not so much
697,i find it interesting that people are freaking out about self driving car accidents weve only had them on the roads for a few years look at how far weve come from those late early brick sized mobile phones now image where self driving cars will be in years
698,yeah its insane how much death we tolerate as normal on the roads with human drivers but anecdotal accidents with automated systems are treated like some epic disaster its the same craziness that happens with human spaceflight a chopper with marines crashes its one day of news a space shuttle blew up with astronauts and the entire space program ground to a halt for years afterward and today we dont even have human space launch because nasa is insisting on proving the safety of things before even flying them experimentally meanwhile how many people just died on the roads in the time it took me to write this irrational priorities hold humanity back we tolerate death where its least meaningful and act like its an unacceptable sacrifice where its highly justified to take risks and deal with the consequences
699,yeah no humans are actually excellent drivers incredibly good as long as theyre doing the actual driving and not fucking about have you ever seen pilots view from f or redbull air race shits insane and they very rarely crash absolute majority of road incidents are due to driver error if we remove the human from that seat then id expect all associated causes for a crash to go away with it i dont want an sdc thats safer than the average human because average human texts behind the wheel goes over the limit when its not safe to do so overtakes on blind corners etc i want sdc thats safer than a really good attentive responsible driver if they cant provide that well then i guess ill stick to driving myself
700,liability is the word here whos at fault people will die on the roads either way but theres a process in place to punish peoples carelessness far from perfect but it exists whos at fault when theres nobody in control
701,what happens when you need to go to a rural area with unmapped roads or off road entirely do we just need separate cars for that
702,us in there were accidents or per day there are roughly drivers on the road at any time most making two trips on the road to and from work which means a chance of having a crash at any given time
703,i would love to know how many accidents per mile there are on the other hand im not sure if society will prefer less people dying on the road but more unemployment
704,its too bad ubers lethally negligent implementation of the self driving car was allowed on the roads instead of just waiting until googles was ready for prime time
705,i will bet if you compare hours on the road versus an average human that self driving cars are already mathematically better
706,please dont take this as insensitive but humans are already killing each other with vehicles autonomous vehicles will never get duis road rage or get tired autonomous technology will only improve our vehicle mortality rates
707,as a researcher i dont think perception capabilities are nearly good enough and it terrifies me that self driving cars are on the road and perception is just one of the many aspects of self driving car technology
708,every time someone mentions that someone was killed by a tesla on autopilot or whatever my reaction is always so fucking what how many people were killed by regular cars it seems like the most important step to all of this is going to be removing human drivers from the road entirely
709,theres a fundamental misunderstanding here of how good self driving software is currently its largely based on being able to see well painted lines in roadways what about in the snow no good answer what about lanes with unclear paint weve all seen those roads with unclear lanes and paintjobs autos autonomous infrastructure insig iduskcnwx
710,wait till they get to somewhere with winter like real winter where for sometimes months the snow covers the road there are no line markings visible and its either snowy or icy as balls they already struggle in the rain coming from a guy who lives in a place with said real winter
711,i think the real problem with avs is going to be when one does kill someone and someone now needs to determine was the av or the deceased persons more at fault if it is decided that it was the av who is responsible the owner of the vehicle or the company or companies behind the avs safety equipment which may be a lot more than just one company and this is with a simplified scenario depending on what the final technology requires what happens if external sensors or signal broadcasters are required by avs just to function reliably im thinking especially of snowy or icy conditions where the cars on board sensors may not be able to detect the edge or center of a road reliably right now roads and road signals are mostly paid for by the public if an av kills someone and it was icy and there is a question about whether some road implanted signaling device failed does that make that citycountystate partially responsible this is likely to provide for entirely new departments of lawyers being required in many legal firms to handle the increased demand for both prosecuting and defense lawyers
712,i think what people dont like about it is they have no control over their death if i drive like a twat and end up killing myself i have it coming but me sitting on my morning commute reading the paper and then suddenly something happens so the car runs me off the road or head first into a lorry is not really an enjoyable thought
713,the key point is not only do they start out safer than the average human driver they get better over time something you cant say about the standard of human drivers i dont think it will be many years before manual human drivers are banned from key roads together with motorcyclists and cyclists and there will be many more prosecutions for jaywalkers
714,tldr scary to use humans to test new tech the world is desensitized to loss of human life similar to companies under the fda autonomous vehicle companies should prove their products are safe and effective before using you might die but thats okay slogan this is terrifying ideology for example a woman killed her newborn in a town elsewhere in my state by shaking it because it wouldnt eat the ct scan showed six blunt force injuries on the brain everyone finds this abhorrent how is abortion not on the same page a human fetus is a human too i digresspeople die in cars and that is a terrible thing to happen someone dies in an autonomous vehicle and thats for the cause someone getting killed is such a desensitized event in the world now that the selling point for future tech egautonomous vehicles is that some people will die during testing and that is okay some people died at sandy hook elementary was that okay in order to improve security at schools no and if you think it was you extremely need to rethink some things about yourself heres the reality of the situation loss of life is never okay every person is unique and wonderful and beautifully made never should there be technology or ideas that we explore where human mortality is not the utmost concern autonomous vehicles shouldnt be sold under the notion that youre an early user so you may die but thats a sacrifice we are willing to make because our product is better at driving than you a la lord farquad youtubehikuxfcsreu its nonsensical death comes for us all thats the consequence of our sin yes we accept that but sacrificing people for technological advancements isnt that illegal not to mention hugely unethical enmwikipediaorgwikiunethical_human_experimentation read the united states section the kefauver harris drug amendment to the federal food drug consumer act requires companies to prove safety and effectiveness of their products theyre prioritizing human life and wellness now as law requires why arent autonomous car companies trying to sell their products with the focal selling point being the best safety and effectiveness too surely this is being investigated surely the autonomous vehicle companies arent experimenting why should we accept a product that isnt proven effective and safe in the highest degree i dont think we should accept it not until its been shown to be safe there are good and bad drivers on the roads every time we get in a car we risk our lives but we take penicillin because we know its been proven effective and safe and labeled as such i drive my particular car because its been proven safe and effective at keeping me that way i buckle my seatbelt for the same reason its proven to be safe and effective why shouldnt an autonomous vehicle be subject to the same parameters im okay with downvotes felt like adding my two pence this is a hot topic rall we need to be discussing this
715,uhhhhyeah k people killed on the road every year in the us any improvement on that is not only good but a testament to how the government couldnt save lives if they were paid to do it which they are which they dont
716,not gonna lie but i rather take the few extreme cases of stupid causing a self driving car to crash than the several thousands of stupid people on the road every day causing crashes and crashing into shit and people i trust something that cant get drunk or be allowed onto the road with a mental problem alot more than someone that has those things
717,don norman the design of everyday things guy was giving a talk that i was listening to while at work and he brought up an important question that i dont hear about driver less cars how will the car signal to a pedestrian that it has seen them and what should occur next a person can make eye contact and signal to a pedestrian with a gesture but a modern car with no driver doesnt have any way to signal intent from the front except for turn signals how will this work at scale when there are other cars in the area what happens when one car decides to stop and another doesnt what about bikes or scooters how drivers react in various countries differ as well how will the car react when placed in a city with a different car culture than it was produced in what about different cars from different countries in one place what about cars with human and ai drivers on the same road all of this has to be hashed out before driverless cars become a significant presence but i rarely hear anyone who thinks well all have driverless cars in years talk about these life or death problems
718,no we dont have to accept that we can just build transit systems that are intrinsically safe instead of retaining the horse and buggy without the horse now with a computer trying desperately to emulate a human which is brutally hard skytran for instance if you have to design in criteria like ok we have an emergency who should the car kill pedeistrains or the occupants youre designing a shitty ass useless system that has no justification for existing i just cant believe this massive blind spot everyone seems to have cars are a bad technology for transporting people theyre also a very bad technology for transporting goods both those things can be done immensely better with something like maglev rail passive or active maglev depending on size people traffic on the local plane should be walking cycling or electric buggies that move pretty slow the transit systems that move people further should be at least meters in the air to make collisions impossible why wouldnt we build faster safer and cleaner options naah its too hard and you have to build too much lets just keep maintaining these stupid ass expensive roads and kill people on them with metal boxes hurtling out of control that makes so much more sense what
719,probably wont change the fatality rate of road users or pedestrians still will give better efficiency
720,have you guys seen the idiots on the road how can you not think self driving cars would be an improvement
721,currently the laws are written to hold the personcompany choosing to put the vehicle on the road responsible for what happens with it that wont likely change any time soon
722,i meanjust dont run down the road in a straight line youtubeauleylq t then you are mostly safe
723,but less will die so its not a sacrifice its crazy to me that people already expect self driving cars to be perfect its a messy chaotic world and accidents will happen but if the overall chance of an accident goes down its a better world self driving cars cant fall asleep text drink or get road rage
724,i have my commercial license i have driven medium trucks tankers dumps flatbeds excavators backhoes and operated around gas electric steep slopes etc etc with all that i feel safer around leaking gas lines and failed power lines than on public roads ive seen that some people simply have no business behind the wheel but in the us its a necessity to drive whether or not you can or should you do thats the problem so im all for sdvs and mass transit make a license harder to get and maintain also use your signals you stupid dicks if your merging you dont have the right of way
725,the thing that freaks me out the most are the people who have no idea what to do a broken traffic light if a traffic light is totally off you dont get to decide that the road youre on is the more important road and to go through the light without any hesitation
726,somebody who was haphazardly trained by a parent who only remembers half the rules thinks signaling is optional and doesnt know what to do when they see a stopped school bus and still has a license that is the kind of driver we have on the road we need to improve on the typical driver not a great driver perfect is the enemy of good
727,i think just getting all the older people who no more business driving into automated cars will work wonders for the roads of course plenty of terrible drivers in all classes to go around
728,redditors legitimately believe that all traffic is caused by a few bad drivers if you tell people that cars are space inefficient and cause roads to fill up beyond their capacity and are unsustainable you will be showered in downvotes
729,my ex works programming self driving cars and what you are saying is a frequent topic of conversation in his office that most people including the ones working there arent willing to accept once theyve swallowed the self driving car kool aid self driving cars can really only ever be a safe reality in cases like garbage trucks where you have a pre planned route and a safety handler present shuttle routes on places like campuses which are a comparatively controlled environment enhanced cruise control like tesla and possibly services like uber where you would have a driver remotely controlling the car the idea that youre gonna have cars driving themselves all over the freeways is absurd as long as people drive in those roads theres just too many variables that make the self driving cars into an enormous liability however he thinks that might be the plan once everyone prefers self driving cars you could turn the highways into routes for the cars in the way few people can drive manual today few people will drive at all and just rely on this service and yea it will be a service people wont own cars anymore so self diving eliminates our autonomy and need to drive its amazing technology for some applications but not all
730,with the terrible average drivers i see on the roads i would rather have the robots taking the wheel i would take those odds
731,it depends on the level of augmentation if you allow the driver to relax it can be a lot worse as they are no longer paying attention to the road this is why tesla now forces you to basically keep your hands on the wheel but safe driving demands constant attention ai assist could be helpful but more autonomy can mean unsafe driving until the tech is perfected
732,id assume that itd come down to the manufacturer assuming responsibility but with a million clauses that count as assuming manual control or whatever that would include things like roads under _ width or with _ variables where if there is a mistake it is your fault for taking the car there
733,so what youre saying is that itll become another manufacturing expense that gets passed along to the consumer insurance will still make their money gouging manufacturers and manufacturers will pass it along to the consumer with a bit of markup for their trouble what that means for the immediate future is that cars with autonomy features will be more expensive than they otherwise would as the roads adjust to having more autonomous vehicles and fewer humans and as autonomous vehicles get safer the rates insurance companies will have to charge to turn a profit will go down assuming regulators arent corrupted by the insurance lobby the amount they can charge the manufacturer will be capped and so the cost to the consumer will decrease commensurately basically itll have the same cost curve as a function of time as any other major technology thats inherently unsafe but also incredibly useful
734,this is the first thing that came to mind bundle it with maintenance subscription for the iot toll roads tunnels etc manufacturers have an opportunity to develop significant new revenue streams
735,correct manufacturers will be liable if the self driving car they made causes an accident of course this assumes full automation of the vehicle but it could still be before we see the majority of cars on the road being fully automated in semi automated cars there is still some role for the driver who could be held liable as a result of their actions regarding profitability id assume having contracts with manufacturers will be based on the number of vehicles they have sold meaning there will still be the same number of risks to pay for of course the pricing of these contracts may end up being less profitable than when it is done on an individual basis self driving cars also have high costs of repair due to the technology in one compared to traditional cars on the other hand if self driving cars cause less accidents there will be fewer claims and so it may cancel out
736,what if self driving cars have wifi and just update when they drive by a public wifi spot or what if self driving cars all have wifi and one updated car can broadcast the latest update to the cars next to it on the highway
737,the real advancements will come with distributed inter car communication as mentioned above imagine all the cars on the a certain road as a interconnected network of sorts each car talks to its neighbors in real time about its position and speed with inter car communication cars may be able to communicate with neighboring cars and sense possible problems about to occur if a car gathers information from another car heading towards it with speed and relative position data it can calculate the forthcoming collision and try to prevent it this sort of system would make collisions very rare and would be a significant advantage over human drivers
738,but less will die so its not a sacrifice according to what if you put weymo cars on the road sure seems that way ubers cars nope the article does a poor job of presenting the facts its an opinion piece its shit saying self driving car isnt a magical this thing reduces deaths poor implementation will increase deaths
739,i grew up in germany got my license there lived there for years then i moved to the us had to take a test to get a drivers license here and have been driving here for years now yes the difference is absolutely real i dont remember how many hours of driving school you have to take in germany but it was a lot in the us its about half as much and your terrible driver parent can teach you the rest therefore perpetuating bad habits in germany i had to take a one hour driving test in real traffic with situations demanding real control and decision making in the us the driving test was on an enclosed parking lot with nobody else on it was minutes long and involved exactly three things parallel parking three way turn and stopping at a stop sign drivers in germany generally follow rules and respect other drivers they may be speeding but they typically let people merge lanes use their signals and pay attention to traffic of course there are exceptions but they are exceptions in the us egocentric drivers who only have their own interest in mind are the norm you have to plan two miles out to get to the right lane if your exit is coming up because you never know who will let you merge when you have to get off the freaking highway people drive slow on the left lane you get overtaken on the left right anything goes people keep no proper distance to other cars because that would mean you leave room for other cars to merge into your lane on my commute i see about of drivers around me on their phone or otherwise not paying attention to the road
740,there are a lot of subtle human to human signals in traffic pedestrian to driver signals about whether they are about to step out into the road bicycle to driver signals etc it is important to get them right much harder than the problem of driving a known vehicle down a known empty road
741,given the way people drive where im from the ai will only really need to be able to stay on the road to be an improvement seriously in the minutes it takes to get to work theres usually at least three people who only miss plowing into my vehicle because im paying attention the people around here particularly like to make right turns from the far left lane and merge from turn only lanes into straight lanes after they skip making the turn nevermind the fact that they think stop signs and traffic lights are just suggestjons
742,yeah these cars are designed to follow to rules of the road to an extent if youre jaywalking where youre not supposed to and expect a car to slow down you are definitely in the wrong
743,huh i said that average human is pretty bad thats why we have over a million road deaths on this planet every year id like to think of myself as a good driver i never text or talk on the phone i use turn indicators pay attention to road signs lots of construction in my city so they change quite often ive been driving for years with no incidents so thats what ill use as a base when judging how good a self driving car is
744,but it could still be before we see the majority of cars on the road being fully automated this is absurdly optimistic the average age of a car now is years to have the majority of cars on the road fully autonomous by would essentially require all current new cars to be fully autonomous id be willing to believe the majority of new cars will be autonomous by but well still being a ways off from the time where autonomous cars are more common than manual ones
745,somehow auto insurance companies will find a way to say with a straight face that self driving cars are more expensive to insure and traditionally driven cars are also more expensive to insure with self driving cars on the road alongside them that way auto insurance rates can continue to do what theyve always done
746,i actually think it could go up on average as those without sdvs will be seen as a much higher risk thats not how it works insurance is already priced to account for the risk of human drivers if any thing that risk goes down as there are more self driving cars on the road
747,not to mention traffic lights and stops may no longer be needed cars approaching the same intersection may seemlessly adjust their spacing and speeds to pass through without impact theres a lot of ways road travel could get more efficient with basic networking
748,i think this is over played its hard to base a safety case upon sensors extrinsic to the vehicle because its difficult to verify data integrity in any case the vehicle must be safe in isolation eg it must pass an elk test in fog at night either by seeing through the fog or driving within the limits of its sensors intra vehicle data cannot replace conventional signals because human drivers are still legal at eis so the manoeuvre cadence cant increase vehicle manufacturers have little incentive to share data because if eg fords cooperate with fords then network effects will favour big players freeze out disruptive new entrants legislation may therefore be required to force sharing however integrity is harder if the standard is open this sort of distributed asynchronous system is really hard to police no i dont think blockchain is the solution i suppose it could be done with public key cryptography a really big database of vins but then integrity verification would depend on internet access which might not be dependable eg in tunnels or remote areas i therefore think it will be limited to more controlled environments like road trains controlled by single operators or non safety critical uses better traffic data for strategic routing decisions as distinct from tactical manoeuvre decisions
749,then you will be the worst driver on the road and your insurance will cost x what it used to and everyone will tell you and your kind to get the fuck off the road because your fucking up the program just like bike riders get
750,dude in front of me doing under the speed limit so i attempt to legally pass him was lanes same direction and he lays on his horn and speeds up to prevent me from changing lanes when i finally get over he flashes me with his brights for a couple miles americans have this stupid attitude of you aint gettin in front of me no way and i own this road im the boss edit just to clarify i was not trying to get one car length ahead of him i wanted to at least go the speed limit and continue on my way
751,just yesterday a car behind me in the ending right hand tried to pass me way too late and almost ran themselves off the road some people just cant do zippers
752,sometimes there are road sign dictating right of way in case the red light stops working if no signs then yeah way stop where who ever comes from your right has right of way
753,yeah because autopilot is not fully autonomous and should not be used while not paying attention to the road
754,what a cool list thank you ethiopia where everyone seems to know someone who was seriously injured or killed by a car has about times more fatalities per car than the uk or sweden per k cars vs addis ababa drivers are actually pretty good but mixing pedestrians and roads at night ends badly
755,british roads are pretty fucking safe driving standard is generally great and road signage is amazing
756,license requirements are also state dependent i was required to take a driving course and get hours in the road with an instructor and i was well past when i got mine
757,hey here it is driverless cars wont solve the fact that everybody being in their own metal box is space inefficient and they cannot all fit on the road at once traffic is not just caused by drivers it is a capacity issue its the same reason all your bathwater doesnt immediately go down the plug hole driving between cities is not what causes most us traffic it is the suburbanisation and car based infrastructure within and around cities
758,ive seen many humans mistaken their phone screens with the road that you seem to conveniently left out for some mysterious reason
759,id like to add that current sdcs can only operate in urban areas with clearly laid out road dividers traffic signs and mapped areas taking or altering the above will incapacitate the car
760,from a traffic engineering perspective ghost cars being operated as taxis will have to be banned because they will result in much higher trip generation which most roads will never have the capacity for
761,how would you accommodate people who wanna go on long road trips and have a road trip ready spacious and comfortable vehicle with them at all times while they go from city to city visiting stuff or even cross a or multiple borders for example in europe especially since on such trips your car usually also serves as storage for your things like say i wanna go from amsterdam to barcelona by car thats a h drive with close to km almost miles and i cant see how this would be practical if cars became a taxi service
762,if the car failed to stop due to design flaws then i would imagine the manufacturer and maybe the government for allowing it on their roads these things arent going to immediately be flawless so it should be interesting seeing it play out
763,youre still going to have to account for foot traffic crossing the road and little billy suddenly deciding oh shit i need to stop at this store suddenly when seconds prior he wasnt going to etc certainly will still be better than humans but its not all rosy kittens as it were
764,people are to damn trusting with their lives yeah im really not first in line to hop in a self driving car speeding down a rural road i just cant believe this is what people want from the future
765,when they can drive in unplowed snow safely and deal with road work ill think about it right now i feel like people need to be ready to jump in at any second but thats not how people will use them its like the uber car that hit the pedestrian driver is fussing around letting car drive not ready when car fails
766,not me im a terrible driver and i know it thats why i just dont drive mentally i just cant handle the idea of a multi tonne cannonball firing down the road at a hundred miles an hour and im the one in control one wrong move for a split second and a dozen people die one failure in the insanely complex machine im trapped inside of and a dozen people die no thank you
767,you aint gettin in front of me no way and i own this road im the boss the saying about sitting higher in a vehicle as having a commanding position has always amused me commanding who as if sitting physically higher than others makes you more important
768,thats very odd behavior for a driver to exhibit in that circumstance the only thing that truly frustrates me though when im doing the speed limit is when someone passes me then very suddenly cuts back over and there may not even be an oncoming car for a mile i dont understand the urgency but road rage for what you did by the slow poke i thats unusual
769,its a thought process of everyone needs to stop driving like theyre the only one on the roads so that i can drive like im the only one on the road
770,that happened to me once there was a huge line of us leaving a relatively large city and the left lane ends so like people with brains all or so of us on the road at the time merge into the right lane except for one guy he attempts to speed up and pass like cars as the lane is ending and then slams on his horn when the car to his right doesnt slam on their brakes and let him merge in front of them some people think that other people on the road should just let them do whatever the fuck they want whenever the fuck they want and it aggravates the shit out of me
771,it is indeed still a capacity issue but keep in mind that near optimally driving ai driven cars would multiply the capacity of existing road infrastructure you could have highways with everyone safely tailgating everybody else for example i agree that making traffic more efficient is treating symptoms instead of curing the disease bad city planning
772,parking could be moved but the space needed for driving will be the same or even more because cars will need to drive empty between two rides also the further parking is moved away the more road space will be needed for empty rides
773,if cars are inches off each others bumpers all zipper merge perfectly dont need traffic lights etc wouldnt that dramatically increase road capacity
774,that sounds risky though the fast car speed in rural areas idea fails to accommodate for any possible pedestrians that are crossing the road
775,people are always so fast to dismiss ideas on the grounds of i dont want a self driving car doing mph in a rural environment at night in winter in fog with my lights switched off its not going to be like that on day one phase one could be motorwayinterstate roads fast wide safe roads with every car going the same direction at effectively the same speed phase two could be years later following multiple software revisions hardware upgrades and improved safety records phase two could be urban roads limited speeds with both onboard and roadside sensors and monitoring phase three could be even more years later rural roads with even more software and hardware improvements realtime satellite updates of dangers unseen etc etc by the time we get to phase iii itll be so commonplace to allow autodriven cars on the fastest roads that my hope is that we will have stopped allowing the evolved chimpanzees to drive themselves on the major roads
776,are you guys in the us not told to move over if you see traffic coming to the end of a slip roadmerge rampas long as it is clear to do so
777,and past attempts to increase capacity more roads wider roads faster roads have mostly just increased traffic as people move further out
778,it would increase capacity somewhat but it is still the least space efficient way of moving a large number of people the number of cars in places like los angeles will still heavily outweigh the road capacity and people will still be stuck in traffic jams because they simply cannot all fit on the road at once
779,highways arent the problem its easy to move lots of tailgating cars in the same direction thats exactly what highways were built for the problem starts when they leave the highway local roads with access to buildings dont support the same throughput think about how many people want to go to an office tower and how long the line of cars would be and crossings will still need to negotiate two roads crossing each other cars cant just run through each other they need to leave gaps for each other
780,haha in what way could you get water through a pipe quicker than that pipe can handle only so much water can fit in a pipe and similarly only so many cars can fit on the road this is the bit you arent factoring in at all there are simply too many cars to fit on the road
781,uber are desperately attempting to catch up with waymo in the autonomous vehicle scene the pilot intervention statistic in that article is from them not waymo or other platforms which have statistically have far fewer cases of intervention the biggest failure with the uber fatality is allowing the platform on public roads without adequate government scrutiny more reputable companies may have pushed for those laws but in the end it is up to law makers to ensure the safety of public roads not to dismiss uber are absolutely to blame as well telsa auto pilot also is basically glorified lane assist and shouldnt be included when considering the safety of proper autonomous vehicles with lidar systems which at the moment are essential so for competent companies with proper systems the fatality rate is zero and from my knowledge the number of accidents where the self driving vehicle is at fault is zero or in the single digits this technology is already proven it is on the near horizon and will radically change the world making millions of jobs obsolete we should be planning for that outcome not scoffing its inevitability
782,putting your privately owned autonomous vehicle into taxi mode while at work to generate income would overload the roads
783,tbf the area is not as poorly lit as the uber video suggested someone who lives in the area posted photos here on reddit even if that were accurate the car uses sensors in addition to simply visible light thats one of the appeals of self driving cars they can use sensory inputs not available to our meaty bodies the sensors on the uber car detected the person and the software registered the sensors detecting her as a false positive and made no attempt to avoid her an attentive human driver would not have killed that woman im all for self driving cars but ubers tech was not road ready if that situation yielded a false negative googles cars have far more hours on the road and nothing like that incident
784,there are a lot of terrible drivers on the road but i think we can make the most of automated driving by shifting the whole paradigm
785,the first deer to come along would result in a hundred or so cars coming to a stop simultaneously and no pileup the car hitting the deer would instantly broadcast about the event to the other cars which would react with neglible delay distances would be shorter but still limited by the physics of stopping distances true theyd still need dozens of meters to stop but they would all decelerate at the same rate at the same time
786,there is only so much the pipe can handle but that isnt traffic the water swirling around the plug rather than going straight into the pipe is traffic nobody expects to be teleported by driverless cars but they will increase throughput and decrease traffic driverless cars dont magically make the road bigger but they do use it more efficiently
787,shitty excuse thats your retort yup its the truth a human driver is more likely to kill a pedestrian no denying it lol i dare you to prove this you know why because you fucking cant they arent on the road yet why are you so sure about something that has literally never happened
788,crazy how many people are missing my point my point isnt that autopilot is garbage my point is that when it crashes its not the drivers fault lol and you arent getting the point of others your driving sucks compared to any autonomous driving vehicle on the road today and its backed up by evidence as is your refusal to accept it thats all no muddying the waters about anything else such as insurance rates who pays for crashes your skill vs the entire country or any of that or anything else you can come up with
789,we could make robot animals that connect to the car network so they can track when the animals jump into the road
790,another few advances in lab meatmilk and we are going to see a vast majority of livestock disappear it just wont be financially viable to spend two years growing an animal using huge areas of land when a vat can grow the same amount in weeks there will still be deer and such running on roads but self driving cars will have much faster reaction times than humans in those situations anyway self driving cars wont get distracted by how pretty the view is for example
791,thats because its meant to be done when traffic is going slower than normal anyways taken from those articles it states just that first one when not to do the zipper merge when traffic is moving at highway speeds and there are no backups it makes sense to move sooner to the lane that will remain open through construction the bottom line is to merge when it is safe to do so second one if roads are clear enough that everyone is already driving close to the speed limit zipper merging isnt as effective
792,do you actually think thats how water works for the last time cars are space inefficient making them driverless will not decrease the amount of space they take up on roads by much traffic is caused by there being too many cars to fit on the road at once
793,theres a capacity on roads and it is way way way below what would be needed for all people to drive autonomous cars places please read my other comments as im sort of sick of replying in this thread traffic is caused because cars are space inefficient a person sitting by themselves in a four seat car means we are taking up more room per person than any other mode of transport autonomous cars will not fix this issue
794,in what way i dont think i said anything particularly controversial i thought you might even agree with me on the need for better regulation of this type of technology i think we both agree that allowing potentially dangerous vehicles on the road is unacceptable but the question is what happens when they are demonstrably more safe than human drivers
795,right but there were four fatalities listed there so is there a specific reason you keep deciding to pretend those people are still alive or is this just how you argue my point was that theyre less deadly than human drivers four people died out of countless tests remind me exactly how many people die in road accidents as is oh you mean they get to take robot cabs to work how convenient and affordable for nobody thatll be one option of course any fee would likely be rather small unlike modern taxi fees another would be buying one when theyre mainstream
796,yup mind actually backing it up with evidence lol i dare you to prove this you know why because you fucking cant they arent on the road yet why are you so sure about something that has literally never happened actually they have undergone extensive road tests if not integrated fully yet one even drove a legally blind man around busy streets
797,i dont know what this means though theres k road deaths in the us if automated cars bring that down to k they work great even though they kill k people if you could go ahead and stop trying to sell me a car that would be great i have people insulting me i have to reply to im not trying to sell you a car i mentioned that one because its a brand im familar with whose features i know check my post history theres some raudi
798,cars are space inefficient and in an ideal world we would rebuild all our cities each year to reflect technology however driverless cars are a better way to use the existing infrastructure which is far to expensive to replace than anything else if to many cars on a road would lead to traffic driverless cars wouldnt use the road a good system would ensure everyone got were they wanted to be as fast as possible if that means one person not going on a road and taking a mile detour so he it again this is not the type of driverless car that is being built unfortunately
799,my point was that theyre less deadly than human drivers your point in diminishing the casualty count was that they are less deadly than human drivers if you have to lie to make a point it might be a bad point you just made remind me exactly how many people die in road accidents as is start quoting me traffic statistics when even of cars on the road are automated and we can actually see what happens thatll be one option of course any fee would likely be rather small unlike modern taxi fees in your head whats your idea of a small fee another would be buying one when theyre mainstream they could also you know get a bunch of money and buy a tesla oh i never thought of that
800,actually they have undergone extensive road tests if not integrated fully yet integrated thats an interesting way of saying on actual roads with people around one even drove a legally blind man around busy streets thats kind of the idea isnt it
801,theres k road deaths in the us if automated cars bring that down to k they work great even though they kill k people wed have zero traffic deaths if we just teleported everywhere but id still wanna see some data on how that would occur but yes that sure would be nice and is impossible to be against as a concept
802,integrated thats an interesting way of saying on actual roads with people around they already have i meant not in full public use thats kind of the idea isnt it the point is that theyre already pretty safe we have a pretty good idea
803,its unlikely that the government will allow completely unmanned trucks on the road for a long time you also need a person to handle the paper work at both ends of the route the job may become lower paid as it becomes baby sitting the truck in case of emergency and doing paper work but its not going to completely go away for a long time personally i dont think it would ever totally go away since the other option is millions unemployed and needing ubi
804,computer programmer here city driving is exponentially more difficult than highway itll hit long haul trucking first as they implement hub to hub routes plus its simpler legally to allow them on interstates than just anywhere theyll still need people to drive from the hubs to the final destinations i think youre safe that cdlsll be in demand for at least years but beyond that it gets murky certainly it wont be all autonomous by then but even some changes the demand for drivers and can price you out if you feel the call of the open road then i think its fine to ride the wave while the surfs up even if you know youll have to jump ship eventually but i also understand not wanting to pursue a career path that may eventually be a dead end
805,if youre going to be otr you may have another to years if you transition into something where you were doing local deliveries or ltl that requires you do a lot of the physical work in loading and unloading you will probably be in good shape for the rest of your working life my company is constantly looking for class a drivers to deliver sod trees and boulders typical otr drivers come in almost every day thinking that the job would allow them to get off the road and be home everyday but theyre only used to driving from point a to point b and sitting on their ass while getting unloaded they cant or wont deal with the physical rigors or customer interaction that comes with the job if you can do those things and get a tractor trailer into tight spots without tearing anything up there should always be work for you
806,self driving cars are a ways away i highly doubt that trucking will go away soon companies are unlikely to want the liability of the mess we currently have the absolute best self driving cars we have still have problems like hitting stationary road markers and running clearly visible stop signs and red lights these are also cars that have people who can handle expensive maintenance the guy who drives trucks is the guy who can make decisions regarding how to handle low visibility situations stop to clear off the windshield take directions from the person directing traffic notice when the truck needs maintenence make the payments for maintaining the truck with either your money or your employers money handle situations where the internet is not available recognize when the route you were planning to take is unacceptable cars have a long way to go before they can do those things
807,lots of folks here predict a long road ahead before a deployed fleet of self drivers instead look how history changeson a dime best to consider the possibility of professional obsolescence
808,you can make an automated diesel or petrol truck and as soon as the first on is on the road there will be a massive incentive to replace all trucks as soon as possible you only have to buy a robot truck once it can work hrs a day without rest or sleep so will provide significantly better value to a company i would assume that ai trucks will happen really quickly after the first one breaks the flood barriers so id guess sooner than years maybe
809,over the road like long haul coast to coast
810,to you are damn optimistic id say at a minimum people are very skeptical about ai driving cars and there is a huge question of liability that has not been answered at all if a fully self driving car gets into a accident even machines arent perfect who is at fault the driver its fully self driving and advertised as such the driver had zero input people are not going to like being responsible for the fuck ups of a self driving machine that then leaves the manufacturer would the auto maker be responsible since it was their ai that caused the accident you can bet your ass manufacturers wont let that one fly so you see the real legal issue here thathonestlyeveryone has thus far been kicking down the road it needs solved before fully autonomous cars become commonplace and legal and before insurance companies will sign off on it
811,id like to see how your career change unfolds ive found your post while looking for career options for myself im also a physician in my thirties im considering codingprogramming as a strong possibility because i like it wouldnt mind studying it and working on some valueable certification i assume its something that could be done part time and remotely so i wouldnt have to quit my job until i could do so safely i assume its a field where you could get a job without a degree and learn as you go i assume i in my thirties and no prior experience have a fair chance of getting employed abroad to work remotely so even a low paid job is worthy because of exchange rates id like to hear your thoughts on these assumptionsoverall plan do you guys think its feasible its just a wild dream because someone on my position would find it extremely difficult to get employed in the area
812,cross near or at a light or near intersections where cars are generally slowing down or stopping if that is not at all possible leave a farther distance between you and the car the greater the speed limit the road is because they can reach you faster
813,it depends on their speed and the driving conditions and how many lanes of traffic youre crossing if theyre approaching you at mph you need a lot more distancetime than if theyre going mph there isnt a set amount but you should be able to be able to comfortably cross the road without flooring it and after youve crossed it should be a few seconds before they pass if the conditions are such that it will make it difficult for you to get going icy or wet you should allow even more time once you drive more you will get the feel for it
814,try to give it at least seconds before the car would get to you cross in areas with little to no obstacles or if you cant then stand on the road side of them making sure to not be in the road if at night cries under street lights never cross on a corner that you cant see down the incoming road try to cross near intersections or other areas drivers have to slow down or pay more attention too keep in mind you can move out of the way faster then the car and if you have to then move in the direction of other objects since drivers are less likely to try to go that way if they get startled
815,the difference between a mechanical failure and an ai failure is difficult to understand i had a mechanical failure just before christmas where my breaks couldnt be pushed down and therefor couldnt stop but because this is a troubling issue that does happen there are other mechanical solutions built into the vehicle i was able to safely stop my car before anything horrible happened because of this ai is a whole different situation and its hard to predict since we dont know how the programming is going to look like in its final version these self driving cars are going to be making choices without our own input just the input of whoever programmed it do you stop or swerve for an animal does that decision change if someone is behind in front or in another lane would that choice be the same for a human instead of an animal in the road if there isnt time to stop and multiple things are in the road what do you hit do you hit a pedestrian or risk killing the driver and passengers how are these choices made who is at legal fault for anything that happens its wayyyy more than just what if x fails and its instead about a lot of difficult moral choices we as humans make these choices based on so many things in a split second an ai is trained to make these choices even if it goes against our own morals what if the self driving car was coded to kill men over women pedestrians over the driver elderly over children what if its trained to not stop for j walkers since theyre breaking the law what if it isnt trained to avoid a bird or small animal in the road there are so many what ifs so many situations so many potential situations that could be missed and not programmed and if it does something you disagree with on a fundamental level how do you live with that if theres knowledge that the car might choose to kill you in an emergency would you still buy the car
816,if i press the brake pedal and nothing happens i may attempt to steer off the road if there is a safe place to do so i may engage the emergency brake i may put the car in park for non drivers this last option would do extensive damage to the transmission and require a costly repair it would be a last ditch effort to avoid a fatality at this point in time i have not achieved any sort of comfort level with how a self driving car would evaluate those options we continue using cars because some of us really dont have reasonable alternatives to conduct our necessary business
817,the road to full autonomous driving is long and full of bumps its still a road nonetheless
818,the cartoon iswella cartoon putting self driving cars or trucks on the road is a process you dont just throw a bunch of driver assistance technology into a vehicle and say welp its self driving right now were at the point where an autonomous vehicle needs someone behind the wheel just in case were getting there but were not there yet soon
819,what i found interesting and why ride being able to honk the horn youtubetbjgvsqeak t is both awesome and possibly terrible hopefully waymo rate limits it or something so you cant just lay into it traffic speed really helps youtubetbjgvsqeak t in phoenix notice everyone is driving in a roughly in the atlanta suburbs a street like this would be mph limited road but everyone would be doing mph school zone youtubetbjgvsqeak t and notice the screen says slow zone in yellow to let the passenger know why its going slow on purpose in atlanta everyone would be doing mph but in phoenix everyone else seems to be speeding and doing mph no idea how waymo picks lanes and when youtubetbjgvsqeak t sometimes it picks the lane based on how it will turn miles down the road other times it changes lanes at the last moment like this example in general it seems to stick center but not always never seen anyone turn on a blinker for a cul de sac youtubetbjgvsqeak t not even a school bus ride wow the destination picker is really cool youtubetbjgvsqeak t and ive never seen it before it seems both extensive and random with odd location omitted not really a complaint just trying to understand the logic more than enough options to the point of too many which almost begs the question why some places arent allowed mask required even in an autonomous ride youtubetbjgvsqeak t seems like it would be easy to roll all the window down for a bit once the drop off is complete to air out the vehicle might not have access to do that in a pacificia platform is everything this would be easy for tesla waymo is stalking you youtubetbjgvsqeak t its like something out of a horror movie from the time you hit search it was s before i could hear the wine of the thing approaching and s before it rounded the corner to pick you up thats faster than i could summon my tesla from the parking lot ok i could probably get an uber quicker than i could summon my tesla but you get the point its faster than is should work you barely got done requesting the car mile is a pretty good deal youtubetbjgvsqeak t i can see the construction zone youtubetbjgvsqeak t and correctly determines which lanes are not usable reminds me of the cones in the tesla but they are actually cones and not hydrants and other random objects reckless guy youtubetbjgvsqeak t and oncoming traffic is impressive for sure the guy was in the wrong but im guessing he did it because of the awkward pause waymo did after the big truck was clear would love to know what the car was thinking during that entire turn skipped pedestrians youtubetbjgvsqeak t just like i would the front door of costco is death in a car in atlanta you just run out of gas after being stuck for hours
820,what i found interesting and why ride very beginning when waymo stops to let you in youtubetbjgvsqeak t it just sort of hangs out well away from the curb barely on the right side of a street i know they hand map pickupdropoff locations and this is like a super small side road so it is no problem but i would have expected the pickup to be the other side of the street heading out and the car would be better positioned pickupdropoff locations are a long tail hard part of the puzzle for sure turning around in the cul de sac youtubetbjgvsqeak t was both super impressive and annoying at the same time it bothers me for some reason turning the wheel that much without moving when they eventually remove the wheel im going to be wondering what the car is doing just sitting there so at least right now the wheel provides context from other parts of the video they seem to have the concept of slowly moving to pre position the wheel while moving slowly maybe the gas platform doesnt give them enough control to do this reliably in tight spaces like this leaving the small pickup street youtubetbjgvsqeak t the car didnt come to a full stop is this legal getting on the main street youtubetbjgvsqeak t takes a good bit of time maybe right turns onto double lane streets is the new unprotected left in the atlanta suburbs where i live you would be trapped until pm exiting like this car does you have to exit x more aggressively or you wont make it out avoids a trailer youtubetbjgvsqeak t parked in the road after a degree bend in the road tesla would will have trouble doing that given its current sensor locations another right onto a dual lane road youtubetbjgvsqeak t that takes a bit this one is extra interesting as it is careful to wait even when it has a clear lane but lets a car in the adjacent lane get by before turning i do the same thing on roads with light traffic since you never know when someone will change lanes on you man this car is noisy youtubetbjgvsqeak t im not sure if its the filming equipment for some of it there are more rattles road noise creaks steering wheel groans etc that any car ive ridden in lately id stab the blinker speaker with a knife if i owned this car lots of talk about it turning the wheels ahead of time youtubetbjgvsqeak t like in this situation i think they do this to reduce reaction time on unprotected lefts maybe i think they have issues with low speed throttlesteering coordination in general either way it doesnt have to be a saftey problem they should know if someone is about to hit them and they could turn the wheels in the direction of least danger before impact is waymo really this loud from outside youtubetbjgvsqeak t or is the gain on the mic up a lot or have i just owned a tesla too long at this point sounds like a bus vacuum or light aircraft
821,ha allergic to main roads what a strange route i only had time to watch the first ride so far but great video thanks the car does a pretty good job was surprisingly bold in the few left turns but then spends miles in the left lane which would be aggravating to other drivers if they do that a lot now lets see if they can enlarge the geofence and drive on all the roads inside the geofence not just the easy ones
822,the pre turning of wheel on a turn it has the benefit of less wear on the tyres and road and also showing to other drivers where you intend to go given those two upsides its hard to say with certainty that the downsides outweigh the upsides
823,with the lock down there should be fewer cars pedestrians etc on the road parking lots should be empty they should scale up and focus on deliveries never a better opportunity for them
824,keep in mind though that compared to usual there will be wayyyyy fewer cars on the roads either way so even if you only see as many waymos as usual that doesnt really tell you that of them were completely driverless and had safety drivers
825,the deserted cross roads googlmapsafekxqbrvvknepa where he pans around is pretty much just used for the school out and park the two main roads mcclintock and chandler blvd they take do get busy but i guess it was quiet over the weekend
826,service was shut down in march due to covid the no driver mode launch is also the relaunch of the service as a whole there were definetly completely driverless cars on the road beforehand passengers were just under nda theyd occasionally break the nda and post clips that would get linked on here then taken down a few hours later also plenty of clips of people passing completely driverless ones on the road
827,i agree there are going to be those that have to own a vehicle like plumbers electricians anyone that hauls around large amounts of stuff that said you dont seem to fit into that class honest question is there anyway you can see yourself not owning a car and using an sdc fleet like can you get a roll around organizer for your stuff that you could roll onoff a bus like sdc hipshearstappscomhmg prodsamazonawscomimagescruise on road jpg cropxw xhxwxhresize again any way you can see it being possible and what would have to change
828,thats an interesting use case i can imagine that some type of long term rental where you keep the car for multiple days could fulfill those needs car rental is really cheap nowadays rental companies only make money through insurance a one week road trip might only cost you
829,ive been putting off getting my license for a while now im after seeing this ive decided to just forgo it altogether the idea of driving scares the hell out of me i cant wait until autonomous cars on the road outnumber regular ones car enthusiasts are going to be mad as hell once this really takes off and humans behind the wheel are banned
830,dont think they will ever ban manual cars i think the next generation will be baffled that we allowed any yahoo to drive around massive death machines at high speeds roads of the future wont be drivable by humans anyways theyll drive way closer and faster with poorly maintained signage
831,yeah never is a long time i should have been much more specific and said something closer to dont think they will ban manual cars on public roads in our lifetime
832,people are already using uberlyft instead of ambulances to some degree nd and rd order changes are hard to see so this is just a thought experiment your challenge just got me thinking i could imagine a reasonable situation where every fleet sdc had lights and could go into emergency mode this mode allowed them to assume right away and ignore signals like emergency vehicles do now for your average citizen this would be locked down to certain destinations like hospitals and such i could see an additional fee or something to keep it from being abused probably the best way would be to have the hospital charge you if you dont get services rendered getting the person who needs medical care from pointa to hospital will always be faster than getting an ambulance from pointb to pointa to hospital its situational if pointb to pointa is faster or slower than pointa to hospital if it is you could always consider ambulances to be an allowed emergency destination and intersect at a point optimal for both the ambulance and the sdc to get meet the ambulance to finish the journey for certain people the destination could be unlocked this would allow a broad range of first responders to get on scene quickly without maintaining vast fleets specialized vehicles like fire trucks would still be needed but i could see almost all government owned vehicles going to fleet avs
833,police often drive their vehicles places that are not roads this requires manual drive an ambulance is much more than transportation to the hospital you and everyone who believes that manual drive will be completely eliminated just dont understand the real world there will always be a need for manual control of some vehicles that otherwise can operate autonomously most of the time for instance my friend is an electrician that works on municipal infrastructure some times he needs to drive his bucket truck up on to the sidewalk to be able to position his bucket lift so he can do his job automatition may get him to the site but he still needs to manually position his vehicle to do his job the same can be said for many different types of service vehicles
834,i think there will be some reasonable time limit between when the av arrives and when you start your trip you arent going to be expected to be standing by the road ready to hop in and go you might need to grab a few things and walk to the end of the block or you might need to spend minutes loading it full of crap to take to goodwill etc
835,you and everyone who believes that manual drive will be completely eliminated just dont understand the real world no we just understand the difference between hard blocking problems and relatively easy to fix problems im not saying that avs will drive off road the same way they get you from point a to b having an av go off road isnt a big deal to solve you just need to be able to direct the av to a specific spot that it is able to get to without hitting anything this small problem doesnt invalidate the concept of making everything av
836,i think you are underestimating the costs of cars since i think weve spread it around so much so to have a car you must pay for insurance and taxes which is going to cost you around you still havent moved the car or paid for it for reference it costs for unlimited bus rides in my decent sized city or in nyc unlimited metro is then you have to pay for the car which can be very expensive and put gas in it and make repairs to it aaa puts the cost of a new car at http newsroomaaacomtagcost to own a vehicle also think of all the space needed to operate a car for it to be effective its estimated that there are parking spots per car thats enough land space to have a house on that you arent paying for directly but what about the added cost to you for groceries because they provided parking for free a fast food lot is not for people but for cars how about all this land dedicated to the car for mechanics gas stations parking lots and roads to have parking on you are paying for all of these indirectly of our land in cities is for cars also a driver we are literally talking about driverless cars in a video showing these capabilities
837,no that is no longer autonomous you could just as easily say that about a vehicle that accepts voice commands i didnt realize you were suggesting banning them how about this motorcycles need to exist because have this thing called freedom where things arent outlawed just because they dont conveniently fit into your idea of how thing should be there are endless limitations and rules governing what vehicles are street legal today freedom never has been and never will be absolute if as i suspect at some point society finds there are enough advantages to allowing exclusively self driving vehicles on public roads then it will likely happen and if enough people want to buy self driving motorcycles then somebody will make them although that sounds like a nightmare to me if you want to be against that thats fine but theres no need to invent dubious technological reasons it cant happen just say youre against the idea on its merits as long as enough people agree with you youll be fine sdcs are supposed to give us more freedom not less and if your only solution to problems is to take away existing options you really dont deserve a place in the conversation you dont get to define what people want from self driving cars nor who gets a place in the conversation thankfully
838,you could just as easily say that about a vehicle that accepts voice commands it depends on what the command is there are endless limitations and rules governing what vehicles are street legal today false rules that govern motor vehicles are finite and strictly codified in documents like the ca vehicle code http leginfolegislaturecagovfacescodestocselectedxhtml toccodeveh freedom never has been and never will be absolute no one said it was if as i suspect at some point society finds there are enough advantages to allowing exclusively self driving vehicles on public roads then it will likely happen nope if people get that stupid the human race will have already killed itself off if you want to be against that thats fine but theres no need to invent dubious technological reasons it cant happen just say youre against the idea on its merits as long as enough people agree with you youll be fine wow youre the one imaging technology that no one has even thought about developing to justify banning manual drive cars you really just dont have a clue you dont get to define what people want from self driving cars nor who gets a place in the conversation thankfully no i dont get to decide but im sure as hell going to point out stupid ideas when i see them
839,more traffic congestion for sure probably more people living further from work too and more roads not everything will be an improvement i would vote for taxing road use per km in cities significantly higher than the current gas tax which doesnt properly tax bigger vehicles or city congestion or evs at all google even if google doesnt do it some company will any international company will be able to end cabs uber and lyft are already doing it theyre only taking time to kill the old cab companies because of people fighting back with legal protectionist actions but the forcing function will be impossibly large with sdcs
840,i think they see uber and see that they could undercut that business model and are trying to get it into that market not to be argumentative but i think this is simply wrong the self driving taxis are a controlled beta testing environment not a business model for waymo or tesla waymo can say see we have the car of the future on the streets of phoenix today but they still own every car control every car and control the boundaries road conditions weather conditions and so on in which the vehicle operates money is not an object alphabet has over b just in cash equivalents the only business model they care about is owning and controlling the operating system of future sdcs that will be worth x whatever uber is worth
841,probably easier and more useful to detect people using their phones or not watching the road
842,this article doesnt make sense in order for a self driving car to handle pedestrians motorcycles and mopeds safely it would automatically have to be able to handle a cyclist as well a self driving car cant simply assume other vehicles will follow the rules of the road it may help them predict what theyre going to do to increase safety but these vehicles are already going to be far safer than any human because they will never be distracted will react thousands of times faster and have degree vision also that ft spacing or wait nobody gives me ft of space when im on a bike theyd have to switch lanes as they passed me and as i lane share when cars are at a stop light that would mean those cars could not continue until i had passed and they were able to change lanes
843,i cant wait until all cars are self driving so many issues could be resolved texting while driving drunk drivers aggressive drivers sleepy drivers road rage loud street racers people who dont notice when the light turned green old people driving below the speed limit
844,does that have to be instead better public transportation wont remove all cars from the road and self driving should cut accidents so both are good right
845,where the rubber meets the road
846,reread that a few hundred years to rid the roads from of manual cars do you know how many cars we have as of today theres no way theres going to be a complete switch over maybe electric cars but self driving i doubt im also saying human reaction time of driving into one of those things wouldnt be good if the person wasnt ready for it
847,im interested in how were going change as we have to focus less and less on the road once you dont have to look at the road it opens up some new possibilities maybe the car interiors will be converted to a mini entertainment center where your windshield is now a tv screen or maybe instead of having the car seats face forward they could face inwards towards the center where there could be a table and everyone could play board games i dont knowjust imagining i also envision the roads changing a lot instead of having human readable road signs plastered everywhere they will probably start being machine readable in the future instead of a big red stop sign it might have a qr code that tell the car to stop but that would be too easy to destroy by vandals so theyll have to make it some rfid build in the road all this will be cool until some hackers figure out how to fuck everything up
848,no thanks though self driving cars will eventually get stuck in a situation they cant get out of youll want to drive them at that point i can imagine that companies will see this need and invent driving your car with a cell phone as a replacement keep the steering wheel and ability to drive until self driving cars are near perfect in every situation note there are a ton of situations with say construction workers holding signs where unless self driving cars can communicate in visual language this wont work i dont want to be stuck in traffic because some self driving car doesnt know what to do in a situation and just parks in the middle of the road somewhere because it cant navigate a construction zone wont navigate around a stalled vehicle or because of a road closure and it cant follow a detour sign
849,all of the naysayers in this thread fail to see one thing autonomous vehicles will drastically reduce injury and death due to collisions k deaths and m injuries per year from car accidents in the us humans suck at driving the faster we take away all control from humans the more lives will be saved yes there will still be accidents yes the autonomous tech will fuck up and cause accidents yes cars will get hacked and fly off the road but with all of this considered tens of thousands of peoples lives will be saved every year
850,people act like there arnt tons of deaths on the road atm
851,this will result in three things i dont actually know enough about cars and how theyre built so the first of these points is my speculation feel free to correct me if im wrong the other two are big things though a higher price point and if this happens with one itll happen with all of them so that higher price point will translate to all self driving vehicles basically itll limit self driving vehicles to only people who are both well off financially and willing to pay that much for a car no steering wheel invites a lack of need to pay attention because why would you when you cant take control of it anyway so drivers will play games read fall asleep etc which is against the law at least where i live you need to keep your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road self steering or not this request has much bigger legal implications than you might think it does take away all manner of control so when that inevitable thing happens and the machine cant deal with it or maybe theres a system glitch of some sort the driver is helpeless and probably fucked
852,as a car enthusiast who loves nothing more than the occasional spirited drive and the freedom of a road trip screw everything about this
853,not to mention if you need or want to drive it off road anywhere that isnt marked out in asphalt and concrete or the car cant recognize would be a no go and that in itself is pretty dangerous by being that restricting
854,if saving lives was a real priority driver education would be a higher priority it isnt people are actually really good at driving and cars are currently really bad at it what people are not good at is driving responsibly thats what causes accidents itll be years before most cars on the road are l self driving
855,they might want to drive on public roads though i havent read the article of course
856,im not saying steering wheel less vehicles will never exist the infrastructure your describing doesnt exist you know what else doesnt exist full self driving cars that work in most conditions just that they shouldnt exist until maybe of all vehicles on the road are driving themselves fully and the data backs up the assumption that its not needed i dont buy the whole its only a test vehicle well a test vehicle can have a steering wheel
857,thing is old cars can be converted into self driving cars relatively easily the big obstacle to self driving cars is solely software im a car person myself and rather enjoy driving but the benefits of self driving cars way outweigh my desire to drive a car myself already in the scenarios self driving cars are capable at self driving cars are far safer than human drivers and their ability to communicate and react perfectly to each other means traffic would be a thing of the past the technology is likely to be ready in less than years id give it years until they makeup the majority of the cars on the road and until human drivers are illegal on public roads
858,and the point is that even if every new car being sold starting today was self driving it would still take decades to turn even half the cars on the road right now
859,self driving yes but what about shit construction zones and areas with little to no road consistency no steering wheel would be suicidal
860,i mean i do look forward to being able to sleep on a long trip as the driver and it would make duis a thing of the past but i still love driving and am a huge car enthusiast how would self driving cars deal with all the idiots we already see on the road though could they react to someone coming out of nowhere and blindsiding the car what will it do when the road lanes arent visible in snow or on dirt roadsroads without any markings how about in construction zones where youre supposed to ignore the lanes and follow a workers directions
861,yes we will all probably get to ride in one by then it may even become a normal thing like having a phone is today but they certainly wont replace regular cars by then there will be a while where both human driven cars and self driving ones share the roads
862,there will always be an override as long as manual driving cars are on the road no override would only make sense if there was by law self driving cars
863,i dont understand the downvotes this is true im in the software industry years in software terms is basically we dont have a clue i always immediately jump to edge cases which is of the work the prototype is what people see and get hyped up about thats the thats where we are at today thats what the public sees the public sees the self driving car on the road and think its just around the corner i see the of work related to edge cases what about this scenario and this one and this one and that doesnt even include the second see the rule of software development which is all of the work to take the product to market qa bug fixes patch planning upgrades plans release plans supportability the shit ton of issues that crop up you didnt plan for the massive amount of infrastructure work necessary to run the software outside of the product itself think more like years ive heard automated driving years for years already its always years away
864,because its really easy to name a ton of situations where self driving cars would get stuck no matter how good they are construction zones for instance or road closures there are so many instances where a self driving car would get stuck that it makes no sense to not have the ability to manually take control its bad enough having cars break down causing traffic backups imagine how many backups will be caused by a self driving car going well dont know what to do ill just stay here and wait for someone to i guess push me out of the way but wait can you even push the car if no one can steer it wait for a tow truck to tow it because its ai cant figure out the situation removing steering wheels is an idea way ahead of the curve of a technology that is in its infancy its the last thing that you will do not one of the first
865,theres never going to be widespread private ownership by the time something without a steering wheel is road legal why would you own something horribly expensive that would just sit around of the time when a subscription will be just as readily available at a fraction of the cost
866,every gm autobot will be insured the same because they all drive the same that will be true when every car on the road is self piloting but not before youre still going to see insurance rates fluctuate based on region and population areas with more accidents will see higher rates regardless of if the cars drive themselves or not
867,it is literally a lesser problem because it doesnt affect every driver all the time but still im not arguing that we should ignore the problem im saying that focusing on that problem as the reason we cant do without steering wheels ever is wrong youre good at finding all the details in your argument but ignoring them in mine honestly were still very far from true autonomous driving for a lot of reasons the biggest one being infrastructure we cant predict what the state of self driving tech will be when worrying about the weather becomes one of the big problems they move on to for all we know itll be a non issue that ends up solved by accident as a result of solving a different problem or implementing a new system i guess thats my point the snow problem for a fraction of users for a fraction of the year is not a today problem so we cant look at todays tech to point out why it cant be solved once we solve todays problems well use tomorrows tech to evaluate tomorrows problems hypothetical we end up developing some advanced sensorai system able to navigate unknown routes without needing to reference preset maps and navigation data letting people take side roads and even travel off road then they discover that routine is also able to dynamically update existing navigational data when the system detects unexpected road conditions like snow or road construction no need for a special snow sub system
868,the a senior software dev at a top software company i have also been qa for some of the time if anything everyone is vastly underestimating the dates problems and scenarios am i worried self driving cars will remove jobs yes but not for years even if self driving was perfect today it would take years to get reasonable market penetration example the first prius which was crazy popular came out in thats years ago electric cars today make up less than of cars sold self driving will take a similar road map to electric cars as they both add an additional cost to vehicles right now i would argue full self driving cars arent even at the first prius point which really only got like mpg and was pretty weak today at the consumer level we only have glorified cruise control and some cool tech and test vehicles that drive by themselves with humans monitoring them no fully automatic driving at a consumer level the first vehicles to go full ai will be long haul truckers because its the simplest problem to solve freeway only driving we dont have this yet working at a good enough level and this isnt even accounting for the politics of it its way to early to be talking about removing steering wheels
869,had the same problem with my sims did they try deleting the road and replacing it
870,youtubeszngdbm_fs there are no good articles about this its a no story that they tried to turn into a story the cars arent getting stuck they are driving down the one way road then turning around at the dead end as they should be doing as for why they are going down that street i think the answer is simply they are learning the city they will eventually go down every street as far as i can tell each car does this only once and has no issues once theyve made the u turn although i have to admit i didnt understand the explanation at the end of the video
871,slow streets are where rich neighborhoods dont want people using public road so they invent local ordnance to encourage traffic in other areas the only outside traffic they want are underpaid delivery and service workers
872,they have to make the turn because of essentially a temporary detour on this route temporarily closing this street to through traffic thus shoving it on the other street while basically anyone else would tell the local ordinince to stuff it the signs a measure to avoid the trouble of making this street a cul de sac because it has too much through traffic for a residential street stroad life
873,fares they are toll roads for residential streets
874,thoroughfare means a road or path forming a route between two places it has nothing to do with tolls
875,the problem with self driving cars is trust im not entirely sure that i trust a self driving car to take me where i tell it to every single time maybe the car decides that ive been to the liquor store or the casino too many times this month maybe the local authorities are quietly routing me around a traffic disruption or maybe theyre deciding what i need to see or not see out my windshield or what protests or political assembly i should attend or avoid sure you have the right to keep and bear arms but the autonomous vehicle network wont take you to the gun store a business paying for seo or outright higher placement on the search is one thing but what happens if mcdonalds pays your automaker for preferential destination placement take me to burger king please hal im sorry dave im afraid i cant do that how about the mcdonalds down the road and thats not even taking things like arrest or abduction into account
876,i am pretty sure the only thing that has caused a google maps autonomous vehicle to get into a wreck was a human the tech is there its the people on the roads
877,doesnt work well enough for one lane tunnels in vegas until it works for that flawlessly its not even close for use on public roads
878,have you driven modern tesla it can be janky but it is capable of driving itself and more than lane assist and cruise control stopping and going at lights can fully drive its self on main roads handle stop and go etc it needs input when turning if there are no lines and requires you to hit the gas at a stop sign but besides that it works and is only getting better but guess what nobody is saying the car fully drives itself if you abuse the autopilot it will get deactivated for the rest of your drive teslas autopilot has also saved countless lives you just never see those stories
879,the tesla does a solid job of auto steering maintaining safe distance and speed on the highway i still pay attention to the road and am still passively driving but the constant nagging to shake the wheel every seconds or so does get a little annoying so i end up just driving by myself
880,because to do that requires a huge effort to automate roads and car companies cant sell cars which are automated to people with tons of money until the roads are automated for everyone yes its a dumb reason but thats it the money is made selling expensive automated cars to people to drive on existing roads its money its almost always money
881,sadly it might still be better than what we have now people texting eating drunk driving racing inexperienced road rage yadda yadda
882,just give me fully autonomous highway driving so i can nap on a road trip
883,i want one but i want everyone to have one at the same time i think the hardest part of the transition will be humans trying to share the road with robot cars
884,i want a self driving car on a self driving highway so i dont have to deal with people texting and driving road rage etc driving is to
885,under a certain definition of design sure but its also not inconceivable that certain pre existing structures could be that which is interfering whether they be poorly designed or simply just too broadly reaching in particular im thinking of legal structures eg safer distillation methods could be hampered by prohibition laws or media streaming technology hampered by intellectual property laws we could also cook up non legalistic hampering eg any product with deliberately designed obsolescence i was going to make a fairly semantic argument about how your statement isnt strictly true however doing the one thing nobody ever seems to do actually read the thing to give your comment fair context i rescind my point and agree that it does indeed seem to be the case that the problems described therein people forgetting how to safely operate cars in the case of emergency overestimating the smartness of self driving tech in the first place are only problems in the presence of immature techpoor design
886,i was riding in a tesla that blew through one red light crossing a divided highway and had to be stopped before it drove through the the next red we were lucky there wasnt a lot of traffic on that road or else we wouldve been t boned
887,the tech is trying to sell you a self driving car that can drive on a non automated road and yes the tech is not there
888,but the people are on the roads and thats an immutable fact self driving tech has to deal with so if youre saying the tech is there as long as the roads are clear of people isnt that another way of saying the tech isnt there
889,yeah horses are probably intelligent enough to navigate down the road while the carriage driver reads a book or does something else the driver could also probably rely on the horse to handle preventing an immediate crash the driver only had to worry about executive concerns going back to that level of autonomous driving seems kind of obtainable again
890,automated cars cant even stay on roads when snow covers the markers humans do fine at that automated cars are still way behind in snow
891,sensors covered snow reflection both falling and on the ground covering road markerssigns not to mention traction and changes in number of lanes etc very very different and exponentially more difficult not really plausible for the foreseeable future
892,if self driving cars achieve an equal or better safety record than the average human then no i dont see why the occupants of a self driving car should be prepared to assume control any more than train passengers are people get killed every day on the roads but we consider that an acceptable risk due to the relative infrequency and benefit to society that cars provide self driving vehicles are no different in fact humans do a pretty shitty job of driving on average so from an ethical standpoint we should feel compelled to get them out of the driving seat crashstatsnhtsadotgovapipublicviewpublication
893,at least for me with adhd manual cars are a blessing because it forces me to have to pay attention and focus ill stick with manual until full autonomous vehicles are on the road ive tried the auto cars with the manual option and its fun its just harder to focus for me because i have less things i need to pay attention to
894,i never said the tech is there clear of people having humans crash into self driving cars will be a reality we have to continue to face as we put more of them on the road if you think we cannot move to self driving cars until they are accident free thats raising the bar much higher then humans
895,traffic is overwhelmingly caused by poor drivers its due to people not leaving enough space ahead of them to only slow down instead of stop and go in a jam because humans are very inefficient at stopping and going there is a natural delay that gets multiplied by each car in the jam they start because people dont drive safely and give themselves enough space in front of them which is exacerbated by merging or lane switching drivers to get in their lane without slamming on the brakes if people drove better and left enough room ahead of them to buffer out those stop and gos or merges throughput and speeds on roads would increase dramatically and jams would clear up rather than lasting for hours after the issue is gone
896,thats massively oversimplifying real word practical issues what if the self driving system gliches out manufacturer discovers bug in the system what if the sensors break what if youre driving in some offroad scenario where the car is unable to self direct are you gonna call a fuckin expensive tow truck every time people accept all those other risks and realities you mention because there isnt a good alternative to efficient travel but we do have a sufficient alternative to self driving weve used it for a fuckin century
897,why is a self driving car glitching out any different to a human making a mistake the conversation needs to focus on safety records anything else is emotional hyperbole people are scared of being killed by a self driving car but if their safety record is the same or better than humans then theres nothing to actually worry about as for off road driving no idea why youre bringing that up the vast majority of people dont drive off road and wouldnt take a normal road car off road anyway if you want to do that then youll have to accept a manual human driving car but for the majority of use cases a self driving car would be fine
898,when driving our mistakes often cost people their lives public roads we should eliminate that variable as much as we can
899,again your argument has no connection to reality real world is not a noisy image generated to fool the ai existing ai systems are already very good at driving and are getting very close to human level yes you can trick them but you can also trick humans into driving into a bridge support with just a few lines on the highway i almost got into a horrible accident once because the stupid workers left two sets of lane markings on the highway and it wasnt obvious which one i should follow i would wager times ai has a significantly better reaction to something unexpected happening and can plan a route hundreds of times per second to avoid a collision i would wager times ai will not fall asleep i would wager times ai will not drive drunk or high i would wager times ai will pay attention to the road more than a human no human is going to confuse the side of a white truck for a cloud and crash into it humans crash into trucks cars humans all the time ai will improve it will make fewer and fewer errors as it learns humans will stay the same ai becoming better than humans is inevitable
900,just the original image with noise not just any noise youre the one who needs to refresh your memory a dirty camera means theres no input image so if all the cameras somehow became dirty you slow down stop hand off controls to the driver ive been driving tesla for a while now and none of the cameras needed any cleaning yet let alone being completely blind all of them at the same time youre truly grasping at straws here an ml system ultimately needs to be able to think like a human no it doesnt were not going to be able to train every situation thats not how it works modern neural nets compress and generalize knowledge you dont need to train it on literally every road in the world to be useful and the public isnt going to want to get into a car they have no control over if they think its going to kill them again youre making obviously false claims teslas fsd alone has k drivers using it and how many of them have died because of fsd it seems rather ethically dubious to widely release a technology with such glaring issues you have no problem with regular cars that are driven by humans who regularly get drunk get high look at their smartphones text pass out due to health problems dont pay attention somehow you ignore these glaring issues thousand deaths per year in the us alone data and you know why because you accept a certain level of risk just like everyone else
901,we have a lot of these here and as i was waiting to turn out onto a busy street a waymo vehicle stopped in the middle of the road it wait until i pulled out making the traffic behind it stop abruptly it was very odd behavior and im surprised no one hit the waymo vehicle i was not out in the inter section or even inching forward very odd
902,im really hoping that self driving and related tech will have a significant positive effect on road safety for responsible cyclists
903,how do they acquire consent via other drivers on the road who are subsequently forced into this study seems incredibly unethical
904,if i see a car without a driver im running it into the ditch get your bullshit off the road
905,and the number of people on this thread talking about running them off the road and deliberately trying to make them crash may reflect why the numbers are so high humans are too asshole to have nice things
906,honestly im impressed with what ive seen with them on the roads here they are dodging crackheads left right and center over here on market
907,self driving cars need to prepare for anything so if it cant handle sf then it shouldnt be on the road
908,for real the wildest shit on the road ive ever seen is in san fran the cyclists and roller bladers and pedestrians have a death wish out there they are insane i mention roller bladers because they particularly stuck out in my memory from the mid s
909,agree bay area resident they are just as good or better than humans on our roads is there something wrong with the roads where you live as compared to ours
910,i live in sf and these things are everywhere as theyre currently configured theyre the shits theyre good for about mph in a they essentially drive like one eyed old ladies which would be fine if there werent an army of them on the road
911,just come back from outside fedex guy with packages running out of the building pretty fast to the driver side of his van parked on side of the road if he didnt have a fedex uniform on i would have stopped but because he has a uniform on i know hes running to his van not going to run across the road i wonder what ai would do probably just stop
912,if they cannot avoid it they should be off the road only humans are allowed to make mistakes
913,an ai will be able to track that person in d and know they running at the van and not the road but if it were unsure it would likely just follow the rules of the road a ai also has much much faster and more accurate reflexes than most humans and so will be able to wait until the last second to actually make that decision
914,we can definitely achieve zero mistake scenarios if all cars talk to each other and road talk to cars like youre saying just right now there is a lot of room for mistakes in current technology
915,imagine youre riding a motorcycle on a lane road and youre approaching an oncoming model the driver of the model has their head in their lap fiddling with their phone because autopilot and autosteer have the wheel the only thing separating you and lbs of metal glass and lithium with a combined closing speed of mph is that vehicles camera system and software repeatedly detecting yellow paint on the road between you
916,full self driving is a special beta program people have to not only opt into they also have to have their driving monitored to ensure they arent risky drivers and it tells them never to take their eyes off the road i do agree its really bad but this didnt get rolled out to random people just a small beta testing group which is partially the point of a beta test tesla sold k cars last year and the beta group is k people per this article
917,they are using their customers and public roads for beta testing it may work for gmail or windows but not for self driving cars
918,is there a bias against self driving everyone i know is excited about it the bias is against charging people to become beta testers and endangering everyone on the roads around them because the worlds richest man doesnt want to pay for professional testing
919,how is it private if its on public roads
920,if theres anybody else on the roads near those people then its not a private beta if i was driving on the highway that night and the tesla in front of me suddenly slammed on the brakes that testing affects me even though i didnt opt in
921,tesla is a software company just incidental that their software is deployed on machines that drive on public roads and can kill people when things go wrong sadly this is how they are also regulated for the most part
922,so many people in this thread complaining about autopilot that have never used it its like if we got road policy advice from a bunch of teenagers with learners permits if regulators want to learn how the system performs they should ask the people who use it or just follow the statistics which show that using autopilot with human oversight is substantially safer than driving manually
923,if teslas were driven only on private roads i wouldnt care but they are driven on public road just because tesla ownersdrivers consent to this beta test doesnt mean other drivers pedestrians cyclists etc have consented imagine if a private company tried to beta test a cure for cancer but in the process every member of the public is an unwitting participant in their clinical trials
924,are you going to reply to every comment on this post with your nonsense surely you belong on rteslacirclejerk this should not be tested on the public road period
925,a camera system and software that never gets sleepy or distracted or drunk or thinks about anything else your situation is comical would you rather be on the road with a distracted driver fiddling with their phone without the autopilot cause thats what we have on the roads today
926,it doesnt really matter that these are special beta testers i mean thats better than random people but the problem is that these are still people on the road these people may be working beta testers but by extension theyre making everyone else on the road inadvertent beta testers the fact that you have actual real safety concerns here raises the bar for what should be considered the readiness level of an update normal beta testing is done to help weed out and find any lingering bugs you go in with the assumption that bugs exist and youre trying to address them before full release in this instance beta should be the final test to make sure there are no existing bugs if you find one that should be cause for serious concern because it means your other safeguards failed it should be seen as unacceptable and should be cause for interval review
927,sounds like it shouldnt have been rolled out on real roads in this state at all is it reasonable that we have this quickly reached the point where we are beta testing self driving automobiles in live traffic environment with other traffic as the potential collateral when there is a bug
928,even if youre correct that they all have full complete control which is doubtful tesla is testing beta software on public roads that means everybody on those public roads is a beta tester whether they know it or not to my knowledge other car manufacturers arent allow to do this
929,except the beta testers were members of the public driving on public roads in traffic with other members of the public
930,this isnt fb doing ab testing on the color of a button this is a ton vehicle driven by the public on public roads all testing should be done before they release it not as theyre releasing it
931,so the article is incorrect administration and issued an official recall notice detailing the problem which affected as many as nearly vehicles even if its only a handful of beta testers if theyre going to be on the public roads doesnt that fall into the same safety issue maybe tesla tested it thoroughly in a closed environment then rolled it out to a couple of beta testers caught the problem before it was rolled out to thousands of vehicles and everything worked perfectly shouldnt an external auditor make sure that the entire processes safe and is actually being followed
932,true as that may be theyre hard to avoid for anything more than short local trips especially if youre driving alone using a dash mounted smartphone with a map app or the cars touchscreen navigation is pretty much a given voice commands help but can only go so far and maps are too complex to be used with steering wheel controls which is why autonomous driving is so important that said autonomous cars should probably happen by way of government infrastructure investments to make the roads autonomy friendly but good luck getting that through the senate
933,theres a fair number of people who are skeptical that itll ever become practical many of whom hold such a position because autonomous cars will probably never be able to handle unpaved roads in north dakota winters or some such which ignores that the bulk of the population lives in more temperate urban centers and that autonomy doesnt need to be able to handle every road just most of them
934,private beta means a select number of people can use it it doesnt mean they arent allowed to use it on public roads
935,on public roads for min across hundreds of cars nationwide many of whom might not have been driving during those min extremely private
936,this is nonsense do you freak out when someone is using cruise control do you even understand how the fsd works it requires the driver to pay attention with their hands touching the wheel at all times private beta means only a select group of people are allowed to use it how the hell are you supposed to test self driving feature on a private road the software issue was fixed the same day this entire story is a nothingburger
937,we all go on a kind of autopilot when we drive if im behind the wheel of a beta program that is known do do weird things you better believe i will have my foot hovering over the break pedal and both hands on the wheel while watching the road and the vector space visualization like a hawk all with a grin on my face as i go holy shit this is amazing
938,rtechnology hates people who cant tell the difference between marketing pipe dreams impossible promises government grant rorts and actual technology but go ahead and post anyway yknow like solar roadways or whatever
939,they want the cars to drive by themselves the company is assuring us that the software is safe and they shouldnt need to have any outside testing done on it were supposed to just allow them to download updates which may or may not release the cars upon our roadways like a menace the company says its safe and that were supposed to trust them when the cars suddenly start slamming on the breaks in the middle of the highway they just say oops that was a bad update the company doesnt want any oversight or regulation about this they want to be able to test and then implement anything they want without any supervision or input from anyone its crazy to allow them to do this
940,the problem is that you cant really train an ai like this by playing it safe if all it is trained on is private roads where nothing ever goes wrong then it will fail the first time it encounters something outside of spec technological progress has always required breaking a few eggs if you want to make an omelet
941,drivers pedestrians and cyclists have consented to fsd vehicles exactly as much as theyve consented to share the roads with inexperienced distracted year olds drunk twenty somethings obnoxious bmw drivers and sleepy year olds your righteous indignation is boring
942,would you rather be on the road with a properly licensed regulated responsible driver who is not just half assed tested once in his entire life back in the teen years and in a society where we dont pressure people into driving when tired and give people ample cheap public transportation and remove unfair stigmas against it so they can use alternate transportation when needed or let technology we dont even trust to run our dumb little phones correctly do something as important and mission critical as drive a car something that not only can potentially endanger the passenger but people in other cars and property around them regulation and change has to happen technology isnt the solution to everything since technology isnt perfect and can potentially be far more dangerous than a distracted driver our over reliance on technology has gotten us into a world full of anti privacy and anti freedom as well as so many other things that has dehumanized us to a point where we are essentially a slave to it technology has to be a tool not a means to an end we cannot allow automated driving to exist as it would cause so many more issues than it would solve as well as further erode privacy and freedom yes humans driving are problematic but solving that issue by doing common sense things to help our society eliminate a large number of these problems is a far better solution than further enslaving ourselves to repressive big brother technology im a lifelong sysadmin and programmer ask anyone like me and theyll say the same dont let technology run our lives its not anti technology its anti control and technology isnt reliable or secure enough in any situation to allow it bugs and hacks will happen and theres no way to safeguard it
943,exactly literally every other car company well lets put rivian and the other tech focused startups aside actually has to make their cars safe at risk of being sued into oblivion so why and how tesla is allowed to conduct glorified alpha testing on public roads is astounding to me i really hope they get reigned in and soon because what theyre doing right now is beyond irresponsible its likely going to cost lives before we know it
944,whats not laughable is all the people on the roads and sidewalks that didnt sign up to be guinea pigs but now have to worry about some buggy tesla ramming into them
945,im more worried about the bystanders and other motorists who didnt pay to get crashed into by a misbehaving self driving algorithm public road is not the place for beta testing that is what testing grounds and tracks are for
946,reason you have to pay attention is the self driving relies on a computer algorithm based on reinforcement learning the more data they can collect the better it will become but they have to collect that data somehow its like the idea of learning algebra if you came from an understanding of basic math learning algebra isnt too hard but if youre trying to jump from elementary school math straight into algebra youre going to be lost right now theyre trying to teach something that has never understood driving to drive so you can think of the people using the software as teachers and the more time they put into learning the better it can be but without them the right at which itll improve will be dramatically slower so in order for this sort of technology to take off and to be safe it requires a lot of training because how can it expect something like a pedestrian jumping into the road or an animal darting across or even another car swerving in front of you these are all very rare situations that may never happen to most people
947,the problem being that something like fsd cannot be properly tested as the conditions on real roads are way to random to be simulated properly
948,using owners as your test platform is sloppy they are also using every single person on those public roads other drivers passengers pedestrians cyclists etc
949,i dont understand how fsd can be a public beta the drivers may consent to using beta software but i sure dont consent to being on the road next to beta software that needs to be tested with professional drivers who are aware of the systems limitations
950,autonomous cars will probably never be able to handle unpaved roads in north dakota winters or some such thats a ridiculously naive viewpoint though autonomous cars absolutely will be able to handle situations like that perfectly fine itll just take a bit longer for the tech to advance to that point
951,i know what beta means i know what private means when the failure of your product involves death of someone not involved in the beta i would not be calling that private beta thats public beta it doesnt mean they arent allowed to use it on public roads so its public
952,it becomes a public beta when you become one of the testing obstacles on the road no one outside of the car can knowingly consent to participate in this beta because it isnt a beta its pre production testing on an incomplete product that can potentially kill someone
953,but its a good question its not exactly just a private beta when youre talking about a vehicle driven on public roads even if it were fixed within mins a lot can happen in seconds especially if it were driving on a highway this had the potential to be a much bigger disaster than it was and that shouldnt just be brushed off
954,do they test it on a private road
955,its fun to blame the roads but that doesnt really help people when snowplows and freeze thaws are anually scraping the paint off the road and causing potholes
956,no they havent consented to share the road with drunk and distracted drivers which is why the police can stop them and fine them or arrest them those behaviors are illegal because theyre dangerous are you implying fsd should be illegal too
957,figure out a way simulations private roads and facilities or dont get into this market at all
958,i sure would hope teala has a purpose built roadway as a part of their facilities cant imagine how they could make any meaningful progress without one
959,the article discusses a version of software that was live from about am to am for about thousand people one sunday morning before being rolled back i was one of those people and drove for about miles during that time and had no issues yes its a problem when any vehicle drives unsafely but we dont know what of the k were affected only that some users reported issues this was also software labeled as beta that users had to go through up to a month of proving they were safe drivers to gain access to and had to sign off on the potential risks and are being monitored for attentiveness by the internal cabin camera they kick you out of the program if you are not looking at the road i really dont know how much more safely you can develop such a program
960,i am under no impression that fsd is perfect or even good but the bar is pretty low for exceeding human capability lets do some quick math the fatality rate for human drivers is deaths per million miles traveled statisticsdetailstate by state tesla has about million cars with autopilot on the road cleantechnicacomover tesla vehicles with autopilot on the road the average driver drives miles per week cut our driving in half is it time for pay per mile insurance shbadaad so telsa drivers alone are collectively averaging million miles per week this means that even if the tesla autopilot got into a fatal accident once a week every single week that fatality rate would be more than twice as safe as human drivers i think you severely overestimate what it takes to be better than the average driver and just perceive a higher risk because its a loss of control not cause its actually riskier
961,use car crashes to control population sizes so you have less people on the road and the cars have an easier time navigating with less obstacles
962,agreed thats why i mentioned a controlled environment public roads are not a controlled environment
963,if someone is theoretically pro automated driving but anti real world testing theyre not pro automated driving theyre also ignorant of how machine learning works if we trained cars on private roads our models would know how to drive on private roads we want our models to know how to drive in the real world
964,i dont agree that haywire or calamity as another on this thread called it is remotely appropriate if you imagine a perfect drive buggy software seems imperfect but humans dont have perfect drives die every year in the us alone add to that the number of injured and the billions in financial damages and you have the true real world baseline for current driving so does a beta software released to s of specifically safe drivers all of whom have been told that the software will likely make bad choices at the worst time qualify as going haywire when it randomly hits the brakes hell no the user can take control instantly the user is supposed to be paying attention they are holding the wheel they are warned in advance the user is selected from a small group of humans specifically based on their ability to consistently drive safe predictably and smooth the situation is far less dangerous than a squirrel running across the road in front of a regular driver is a squirrel crossing the road in front of a car indicative of a super dangerous situation would you have told your friends your drive went haywire on the way home if that happened of course not you probably wouldnt have told anyone because its not newsworthy just like this whole post
965,this is about public safety first keep that quote in mind when people start pushing for only allowing autonomous vehicles on the road it will be the exact same words being used eventually autonomous vehicles will be safer than human driven vehicles and people will push for only allowing the safest option
966,from that article in most tesla vehicles equipped with a version of autopilot to the autopilot features are mostly being used for highway drivingand the same distinction is not being done the average vehicle whichis based on nhtsas overall crash data in the usaccidents are more common on city roads and undivided roads than on the highway so its not a fair comparison
967,how many deaths have occurred this week from inattentive drivers we must put cameras in every car and protect everyone now if someone picks up their phone the car must self park now all manually driven cars are high risk get them off the roads
968,wow ok name a company that has full self driving capabilities and a roadmap half as good as teslas ill wait no one here is shilling for tesla youre just saying dumb uninformed and easily disproven shit
969,its early release software that is currently being rolled back because it was causing cars to go haywire its not safer than a human driver you can make the argument that computers have the potential to be safer drivers than humans due to reaction times or whatever but that doesnt automatically mean any software you write to drive a car automatically is good and safe the software needs to be meticulously engineered and rigorously tested not rolled out like a shitty early access video game and set loose on public roads
970,what about that video of it just slamming into a deer on the road
971,what thats not at all what i said i literally said it has never hit a pedestrian now in the future if this system is widely used and on the extremely rare event that someone is out of sight then lunges into the middle of the road and they get hit i would consider that unfortunate but nothing couldve been done so accidents will happen no matter who or what is driving if it becomes a pattern with statistical significance thats a different story
972,i cant believe i have to spell this out theyre beta testing automatic driving on public roads with people that didnt sign up for it
973,such that no one was ever injuredkilled probably very few incidents happen but that doesnt mean products like space heaters washing machines train engines and whatnot werent initially tested as much as possible inside a lab before deploying them on a large scale im not arguing vs having a couple of beta testers on the roads with safety glasses on here im arguing regular consumers shouldnt be enrolled in self driving software betas without being employed in some way by the company to do so and having done some specific safety training like if this was the new call of duty beta on the road want to test these cars hire some damn qa people to do so in simulations then in private roads and then on public roads and keep doing that until you dont consider that a beta at all at that point some incidents may yet happen and that is okay no tech is perfect
974,imagine thinking that was the build they didnt immediately disable and issue a fix quickly that was used on a small subset of the cars on the road with people who know the risks of using this advanced beta and theyll kick you out of it if you use your phone often while trying to use the software the production software i had did what i claimed not this small group maybe of their cars did before being fixed quickly
975,but the number is higher than if the robot testing wasnt done on public roads in which case deaths would likely be so its a sort of loaded question isnt it
976,this is all perfectly reasonable i suspect there are many in this thread who would still consider that to be too much a trained qa tester on a public road is still exposing the public to a beta product and several people seem to find that objectionable
977,you know there are a million of these on the road it should be an epidemic of crashes at least ten of thousands but
978,i just returned from a mile road trip almost entirely on autopilot and fsd beta no big issues
979,yes if a human driver hits another human driver i suggest we ban them from driving as their algorithm is broken and should not be aloud to guide cars we dont do that though we look at the situation and we dont generally punish people for accidents if the driver was negligent theres jail time but if someone happened to dive in the drivers path at the last minute the driver is not at fault have to look at the issue beside we do regulate human drivers its called a drivers license yes and this applies here use of teslas autopilot in the road currently requires a licensed driver thats the regulatory rule take something like adaptive cruise control a common feature in many of the current cars if theres a problem with it and the car doesnt slow down as a result of the car in front of you the driver is expected to brake himself you wouldnt expect the feature of adaptive cruise control to be banned if theres a problem with it in a ford model youd expect ford to recall it and fix it if theres an accident as a result of it unless the bug was one that prevented the human from overriding the adaptive cruise control youd expect the driver to be punished the more advanced features of the tesla should fall in the same category as long as the regulation is that a licensed driver is required on the wheel the licensed driver has responsibility if autopilot kills someone and the driver didnt disengage the autopilot that driver should be punished and tesla is expected to recall the feature and fix it unless the bug is such that it prevented the driver from disengaging autopilot in which case tesla should be criminally responsible for negligence
980,im not against evs renewables self driving or climate change actions what i am against is when a company purposefully obfuscates and hides data from a beta program that i am involved in but did not consent to we can aim to improve evs and self driving without gargling elons cock if a company is going to be testing self driving vehicles on public roads then all their test data should be publicly available and they should be able to be held accountable if a fluke in the software ends up killing someone
981,i think the point that a lot of people are making is that tesla self driving is being beta tested on the public in a manner than no one outside the tesla can knowingly consent to as long as the self driving mode is being used on public roads full crash data and statistics should be publicly available with the ability to hold the company accountable when it falls short and their car kills someone
982,self driving cars could be great as long as people maintain them properly i see so many cars out on the road now missing parts burning oil or with tires just about flat that i am concerned if someone cant maintain the low technology cars how can they be expected to maintain high technology cars im in favor of self driving cars but if the sensors are not kept clean and working the car could be driving blind
983,so has a self driving car been on a freeway yet have they been through a blizzard pouring rain fog etc they use cameras to see and follow road markings hows that going to work when there are no markings anyway youre not getting your self driving car that you can get in the back and fall asleep while driving to work or the bar for decades
984,what those of us that drive classic cars that would suck if i got banned from all roads just because my car wasnt built with auto drive or motorcycles driving is an experience that i enjoy it will be many years before they ban human drivers outright i can see it happening on interstates at first
985,i think theres actually going to be a huge problem with self driving cars in the works of the time state its really easy to tell a human that they have to pay attention and be responsible for the vehicle at all times but have you met humans they are terrible as stand by operators if they arent actively controlling the vehicle they will not be ready to take over at a moments notice they will not be watching the road and remaining vigilant at all times
986,this a million times this couple this with the fact that a lot of these cars are relying on sensors that may or may not be suffer from interference when every car on the road is using them ultrasonic sensors for example best to roll this one out slowly
987,we do need laws we do need regulations we do need guidance i fully expect many of these will be fairly light handed and nothing underhanded speed limits share a very explicit purpose many people frequent roads that they dont drive frequently posted speed limits inform the drive what speed is safe for the road and what speeds the road was designed for sure you could bring up some fringe case like the autobahn but that road does have frequent speed limits as someone who has drove on it and people know it is reasonable and safe to drive faster on that road because it was designed for excess speed
988,im willing to bet eventually we will have beacons placed in the road every now and then for tracking
989,cops will be irrelevant car just drives you straight to jail instead you spend the whole time freaking out what was it this time defaulted on your mortgage and the bank is taking your kidneys or maybe you missed a traffic ticket and they decided to remove you from circulation its not your fault you cant afford software update and your permarental took a suboptemized traffic route and caused a few milliseconds delay to someone elses commute every second that passes you feel a scream rising in your throat you press the door button but it refuses to respond the bulletproof windows of the tesla permarental designed to protect you from gang violence keeping you from throwing yourself into the road you desperately wish you had bought the standard package so you would have an actual key and not a remote start button just so you could slit your own throat with it the world passes by completely unaware of your growing terror the walls of the car begin to close in as your future as a test subject for a pharmaceutical as a more ethical replacement to animals becomes clear to you its ironic really you protested animal testing in college you see the jail now the drive in beckons as your car makes the final adjustment and prepares to leave you to your fate your phone vibrates the uber bailbondtm app is offering to bail you for ten thousand plus adjusted course mileage surcharge you agree but you only have three hundred bucks left after your apple ieye needed to be replaced last month due to manufacturers fault you open up the dao loan exchange and apply opting for twenty thousand to cover conversions and tumbling to ensure you dont end up with tainted currency the smart contract sits uncompleted as your journey comes to its end your life flashes before your eyes as the money is approved and your account emptied to secure your freedom minus twenty dollar first time credit of course by the time your mostly uneventful life has been played to you the car is almost at its original destination you get out of the car and make your way inside the featureless dormitory you reside in its three foot efficiency elevator depositing you at your tiny quarters you strip off your clothes as the door slides shut behind you the chill of the room biting at you as you do youd have a shower but its been broken for months a slow dripping that fills your meager dwelling with mold and rot the arbitration clause and abdication of rights agreement leaving you without recourse with the corporation that runs the facility you climb into bed the sewn rags you call a blanket wet with moisture that only serves to further your discomfort your ieye playing videos of the latest apple appliances and updating you on the latest celebrity news sleep is fleeting and dreams are corrupted by commercials all that is certain to you is that you will awake into the world and hope your job hasnt been replaced by a machine ok im done
990,youll probably have to login to your car to gain access to certain roads via fingerprint or some bullshit and if you have outstanding warrants your own car will lock the doors and drive you straight to the nearest precinct
991,right as long as they can continue to tap the consumer directly thats my point even if it makes no sense at all for the individual to carry insurance because the no longer have any control over the vehicle the insurance companies will lobby to keep these laws in place if they can maintain the illusion of personal responsibility they can keep charging individuals who have little bargaining power on prices compared to google ford uber etc instead of the companies who produce the self driving cars and actually have more control over their performance on the road
992,dont even need a track i can absolutely foresee separate lanes for driving autonomous on highways and shared surface roads it will be a long time before everyone buys leases rents or whatever other car share business model may arise autonomous cars vs the perfectly fine car in their garage currently
993,why as a human youre much more dangerous other people are at risk even to the extent that compulsary rd party insurance removes the risk of you costing other parties money theres still the risk you could maim or kill them should people still have the option to drive extremely old unsafe cars in many juristictions classic car enthusiasts arent allowed to take their old cars on the roads also synergy between autonomous vehicles means the road networks will work better without human drivers even a small number of human drivers will cause problems
994,what about roadworks how do they handle them
995,umm automated lane control and auto braking have been saving people from crashes for a couple years now with excellent dash cam videos of the events shared on reddit regularly i agree it wont magically save you after the car is already out of control but if you arent braking when you should be or you are going straight when the road is curving you can definitely be saved by the machine
996,because no one has the right to tell me i dont have the right to operate a motor vehicle fuck off with that shit and i dont know where you live but that is entirely untrue in the states most enthusiast cars are completely road legal but yeah it comes down to me being an individual and you not being able to tell me what i can and cannot do the fact that you think you can makes you sound like an authoritarian asshole i cant believe i even have to explain why i should be allowed to drive a car absurd
997,i think what they mean is that premiums will go up for those choosing to control and drive their own cars because they arent going to be as safe on the road for and compared to other drivers wholl be riding in self driving cars and not controlling them so because self driving cars are safer premiums will go up for those who choose to drive themselves
998,fun fact the amish have to use steel wheels on their buggies due to religious reasons those wheels rut up the pavement something fierce however they dont pay into any of the taxes that funnels to penndot for repaving the roads
999,im all for every car on the road choosing safety of the time i also dont see that as being much of an issue again due to their better response time a computer will be able to safely drive faster than a human could and if having to leave for work minutes earlier so driving recklessly isnt necessary is the only downside id say thats a damn good compromise leaving aside the absurd idea that driving like an asshole gets one to work any earlier
1000,society can tell you what to do on the road its not a right its a privilege see speed limits
1001,pretty obvious computers are not distracted nor drunk driving isnt an art form its a science and its not a difficult thing to do consider the dumbest people you know can still keep the car on the road of course theres exceptions road conditions road work pedestrians other cars accidents but thats what google has been working on for over a decade via real mileage and simulations the beauty of it is that with one accident we can take the data and train all cars instead of a few surviving participants its painfully obvious computers humans at driving
1002,if you let these things onto the road in imperfect condition you are sure to kill any chance of building enough trust with consumers for wide implementation no one is going to want a self driving car if they hear about self driving car accidents regularly and you can bet your ass that every mass media outlet will bring every single incident in the largest possible headline font people wont care what statistics say if they keep hearing about how self driving cars are dangerous because x of them crashed or had near accidents in the past month
1003,yup its crazy that we let year olds with six months of training whats that maybe k k miles tops get on the road as fully licensed drivers
1004,the way they do it in a lot of states is close the roads when conditions are that bad as long as the self driving cars obey the road closure announcements they are good
1005,is you being allowed to drive your antique car really worth hundreds of thousands of lives think of the children drive your antique car on a private road or track you have no inherent right to drive on public roads
1006,im from michigan same here i was going more for actually being able to find the road and stay on it plus the fact that atleast a of our roads are dirt
1007,im not arguing that they dont drive safer than humans im arguing your assertion that its not difficult for machines especially when encountering new situations that a human would have little to no trouble with the fact that we can drive without eyes in the back of our head centimeter precise depth perception radar that can see through nearby cars a literal trunk full of computation and storage and detailed pre collected maps of exactly every road we are driving on is how i know that its not easy for computers let me know when a computer is safer at driving just by having two cameras and two microphones and ill tell you its now easy for cars
1008,we didnt evolve to be able to drive we evolved to handle that sort of input and real time analysis however you still seem to be arguing about the relative abilities of cars vs computers which im not talking about im pointing out that its difficult for a computer to drive a car thats why its cutting edge technology with a handful of companies even trying to make it happen you know what isnt difficult for a computer spreadsheets databases that stuff thats so easy foss programmers give it away for free its not at all easy for computers to drive cars and it wont be for many many years even if theyre already better at it than humans its not easy for them and its not easy to improve them if it was easy to improve them when they made a mistake we wouldnt teach them how to avoid the mistake by giving them hundreds of thousands of miles of driving wed say dont turn left in front of oncoming traffic or wed say a flashing left yellow arrow means you can turn if its safe it wouldnt take examples to teach them the difference between a real stop sign and a stop sign on a roadside billboard as part of an advertisement
1009,atleast a of our roads are dirt in michigan do most people spend their time in cars driving on dirt roads
1010,yeah its an actual ban on driving manual on public roads thats the point just like we ban unsafe vehicles from public roads now just because we accept a level of death and injury today doesnt mean we have to continue to accept that status quo indefinitely regardless of advances
1011,i think these have great potential for carshare providers like zipcar in the not too distant term right now zipcar service typically only pencils out in the densest parts of an urban area imagine instead a zipcar that can drive itself a short distance to be where you reserved it and as more people move to an on demand model of car ownership that will mean people can start thinking of cars less as an all you can eat buffet and more like a pay as you go service those people who can move to this model will save gobs of money personally and save some of the broader social costs of everyone owning private vehicles acceptance of more exotic applications like the robotic taxicab will come later the carshare model still allows people to be in control while they are in the vehicle once people see that their reserved vehicle shows up unscathed maybe acceptance for the taxi model will happen quickly quick side note taxi drivers often pay enormous amounts over k in some areas http for their license to operate be prepared for these individuals to flip their shit if they start competing head to head with google more likely is that the taxi industry will start lobbying hard
1012,representative republic and why states rights are important imagine how long we would have to wait for the federal government to allow droids on the road
1013,more likely is that the taxi industry will start lobbying hard i think theyll be ramming them off the road
1014,but im just a pedestrian how do i get to opt out of people using it on the roads i use to cycle on
1015,accident rates are mostly a red herring fully autonomous self driving will never happen without the us government putting up enough money on road infrastructure to effectively turn roads into railroads all the rhetoric about accident rates or precision is a way to enforce this completely false notion of technological inevitability so that car companies can appropriate more public subsidies for private gain its actually very similar to how the development of counterforce nuclear strategy and therefore nuclear armament escalation hinged on the supposed inevitability of missile precision improvements which would not have been developed without the political decision to develop the arsenal for counterforce in the first place
1016,uh well i was expecting the obvious it drives off the road solution
1017,a baby shouldnt be on the road all alone anyway just hit it and teach its mom a valuable lesson s
1018,why would it not be on that side bmw a german brand makes left wheeled cars russia is a right driving country which means the steering wheel would be on the left since the driver side in the car is opposite to the driving side on the roadi have no idea what the confusion is
1019,self driving cars wont happen they require road infrastructure that no one will provide
1020,the issue with self driving cars is that they can only see so much in some cases they cant tell what a shadow is if theres a lorry turned over if a car is parked on the side of the road just to name a few end of the day until all cars are self driving i believe that it should always be the drivers responsibility as theres sometimes a need for the driver to take over
1021,it might be obvious if the cars were always self driving the problem is that at the moment they are only partly so and that will probably continue for a long time this means that the car will hand control over to the user at times and may do so at short notice when the user is not paying attention if a crash results is that going to be legally the fault of the user or of the company which designed the car which handed over control while the user was pouring coffee if the company goes out of business must any cars of that brand be taken off the road despite a good safety record i can see the arguments for holding the company entirely responsible and i used to take this line now i think that it cant be simplified that much
1022,i would say if i buy a car and let it loose on the road and it smashes through a shop window it would be my responsibility since i was the one who directed it i would need insurance to cover the cost the insurance company could then try to recover their cost from either myself or the manufacturer also if i do not keep it maintained eg bald tyres which causes an accident when the vehicle can not break in time then i would be responsible for the accident
1023,is that going to be legally the fault of the user or of the company which designed the car which handed over control while the user was pouring coffee this isnt what current semi autonomous vehicles are meant for as much as i think the tech is dangerous i cant really blame the manufacturer when people fail to follow what is legally required of them if the company goes out of business must any cars of that brand be taken off the road despite a good safety record i can see manufacturers being required to have insurance covering this or for all of them to pay into a single pot to cover it
1024,the technology could be used for buses and other public transport also but youre right the infrastructure just isnt there especially i the uk with our narrow roads
1025,fully charged has a good episode this week there are claimed level self driving vehicles now operating in china teslas are level requiring constant attention from the driver level allows the driver to take her eyes off the road but be ready to take over if the car gets stuck level must transfer control in a safe way level will do everything and might not need driver controls but is restricted to certain suitable roads level can basically do anything a human driver can do youtuberpjxtqs i remain a little sceptical even if a computer can handle any normal driving event what about when a bouncy castle suddenly blows over the roundabout edit i tweaked my explanation of the self driving levels as i read the law society report pdf s eu west amazonawscomlawcom prod storage jsxouuyquploadsautomated vehicles joint report cvr pdf
1026,not that simple yes a self driving car can dump an emergency in your lap conversely it will routinely hand over control in non emergency situations such as minor roads and equally routinely take control in emergency situations such as using proximity to trigger the brakes there are all sorts of edge cases
1027,thing is rule for motorways and stuff it will let you work in a reduced attention state but at the current moment your still driving cgp greys video vdtgmgqxysm kind of shows for every easy road that the teclas currently make easy there will be a nightmare road that they hate i still think the self driving algorithm does reasonably well on it though
1028,unless theyve changed it you dont actually need insurance to drive you can give a bond instead which i think is k the text is in the road traffic act although it is possible it has been repealed and im not aware
1029,okay well i agree a basic provision of good food from the government is not a bad thing i just think car insurance is not top of the list of things the government should provide but currently dont one problem is that if you charge everyone the same amount is moral hazard or maybe its called something else but high insurance costs keep certain drivers off the road if suddenly it cost the same or was free at the point of use for everyone then you could expect more bad drivers on the road and higher crashes and deaths if you do base it on risk similar to now the problem you get is that you will only get one price currently there are lots of companies offering a quote for you so what you may find is that it actually becomes more expensive for certain people thats because each insurance company currently takes a slightly different view on risk i get the point that if its legally needed why should there be a profit made from it thought but i think loads of things are needed to different degrees where profit is currently made
1030,i dont know if there is a change of view they would have to retrofit lidar to all their cars if so the graphics i have seen of a teslas view of the roads look as impressive as those of waymo or baidhu that said i am just a little sceptical that anyone has managed to overcome the problem of a car driving at level able to deal with any ordinary driving occurrence but it needs to be able to safely transfer control with extreme reliability when something outside its experience happens
1031,i honestly love this idea ive been imagining this sort of thing for a while now but i assume therell be something that comes along and ruins it for a start if theyre all synchronised with some kind of centralised server someone is going to try and hack that server but even in that rare case i imagine theyd still result in fewer accidents and deaths than we see on our roads currently
1032,yes it does mean some computer science work to be done maybe rather than communication it could be done by having the traffic lights and crossings operate on known schedule to the second and the cars know that schedule i think they would need to be able to see red lights too as a failsafe i rather wish there was more appetite for road maintainers to work with car makers in developing features to aid autonomy all a self driving car needs to know at the most basic level is where is its path and is there anything in the way
1033,i wonder if we can do something about tire and brake dust by hoovering the roads i am a little sceptical about the level of tire and brake dust emitted by a car i wonder how much mass a tire or brake pad loses in a year perhaps the levels we see in the air are partly from historic deposits also evs often have regenerative braking and dont use pads so much
1034,what about tying accidents to the points system on your licence do many in a period of time and you have to retake the test or re education like speed awareness classes the problem is those accidents have already happened risk based pricing segments the population to give the same price to similar people well its only the same if all the variables match but it will give largely similar prices to similar people this information is known ahead of time ie before an accident occurs of course once claims happen past claims will also be used to determine price but many people will get very high insurance without having a claim xb im not sure you would have more bad drivers those same bad drivers exist but now they only pay more if that poor driving impacts somebody else you could be terrible but as long as you dont get caught speeding or are lucky enough for other drivers to compensate for each mistake then you are on the same footing as a perfectly competent driver so yes and no if you segment by age and occupation and postcode and other factors you will see a big difference in the frequency and severity of crashes of these people so these people would pay way more than and older person with no claims history yet neither of these people have ever caused any issues for other drivers on the road xb the one price problem is something that while i have no evidence for feel like theres a certain level of collusion to the way insurance is calculated why there currently isnt a one price problem im saying if the government did it on a risk based approach you would only get one price currently you can go on compare the market or whatever and gets loads of different prices insurers will react to other insurers prices changes for lots of reasons including the other insurers have increased prices and so they know something we dont like wise for decreasing prices they are currently too competitive and dont want to take on any new business as we do not have the staffing levels to maintain a good quality of customer service similarly they may decrease prices not because the risk has decreased but because they simply want to grow the business if all the insurance companies were very good at pricing the risk correctly you would expect all the prices return to be very similar but that not the case as all insurers have different target markets and business strategies they have different risk models with different risk variables going into those models
1035,imo this technology will never reach the point where it is safer than human drivers i really cant understand why companies are pissing away so much money on something that is really not needed what is going to happen when the computer that makes the whole thing work crashes the sensors fail or some mud gets on the road and the vehicle in front of it kicks up the mud and it covers up the sensors and the autonomous vehicle cant see the car in front of it or the edge of the road i also want to see what happens when one of these self driving cars meets a farmer driving a huge tractor or a combine on a narrow country road is the computer going to be able to pull the car off onto the shoulder to let the machine pass or is it going to get squished under the huge tires like the junkers at a monster truck rally i get so fed up with new technology sometimes that i am really tempted to just go join the amish they live pretty much the same way my grandparents did until the end of wwii and there is a lot to be said for that lifestyle my grandparents got their first car circa but didnt have electricity in their farmhouse until and my grandad farmed with horses until only two decades before i was born
1036,one of the big problems is all this damn technology they are putting in new cars people are too distracted by their in vehicle infotainment system and too busy fiddling with the touch screen on the dash to pay attention to the damn road i dont care if you have bluetooth and it is hands free if you are talking on the phone while driving you are distracted our roads would be far safer if all of this new technology were banned by the ntsb and automakers were forced to go back to making cars like they were years ago with simple easy to use knobs and buttons
1037,now offering drive thru coronavirus testing locations in hampton roads heres information about drive thru testing options in hampton roads the one in williamsburg isnt doing weekend hours for some reason but the ones in hampton norfolk and virginia beach are
1038,i think what they mean is testing to ensure the cars done turn into sentient road rage addicts
1039,insurance is what will finally lead to the elimination of drivers as they become a smaller and smaller percentage of cars on the road their premiums will increase and eventually become completely unaffordable
1040,the good news for the industry is that it has time stevens estimates that by there will be only million autonomous vehicles on american roadsless than percent of todays total and as of now the technology required for autonomous features is extremely expensive to repair meaning premiums will initially rise as more cars featuring them roll off dealers lots this is the lie they tell themselves and their investors million autonomous vehicles in fleets could handle the transit needs for about million people this is pretty close to the total population of the us the article doesnt even entertain the idea that maybe sdc fleets are the future and not individually owned cars this is probably because the insurance contacts steered away from this being a possibility at all they realize that if this does happen there really is no insurance industry as we know it today left the rest of the article is basically an argument for why you wont own an sdc unless you are rich and really want to as automation reaches levels and fully autonomous capability with the option for a human driver to take over and fully autonomous with no human involvement respectivelyinsurance is going to change dramatically it wouldnt be an article without the reporter messing up the sae levels i dont blame the reporting sae leaves are useless for talking about avs not since we came up with the rules for what is a fruit or a vegetable did humans create a more useless and confusing taxonomy
1041,so like the way toll booths were removed after the roads were fully funded in nj oh wait
1042,what happens when you upload uber into your car so it can go earn some cash for you while you sleep and a freak event occurs your car has to choose between killing one or ten who is responsible for the death this railroad switch gets thrown around a lot but the self driving car will never ever choose who to run over it will use all available traction to stop while staying in its designated lane of travel someone will kill themselves by leaping under a sdc sooner or later but the sdc wont end up being liable in that specific case just as a human driver wouldnt be liable
1043,this railroad switch gets thrown around a lot but the self driving car will never ever choose who to run over it is unlikely to come up sure but that needs to be coded in so the decision still needs to be made by programmers even if it never comes up it will use all available traction to stop while staying in its designated lane of travel thats a decision in the trolley problem this is the equivalent to saying ill never choose between the guy on the left or the group on the right ill never flip the railroad switch thats still a decision and typically philosophers regard this as a bad one
1044,its not unlikely to come up it will never come up it doesnt come up for human drivers for a reason why should it come up for digital drivers why dont we teach young drivers how to choose who to run over when they face this choice using all of the traction available to stop while staying in the designated lane of travel is not equivalent to killing the person on the track its equivalent to not killing anyone in almost all cases this is why we instead teach young human drivers to watch out slow down in certain situations and hit the brakes if things go sideways cars have a finite amount of traction available to be used between both turning and braking unlike the trolley problem which has infinite traction available for turning and zero tracking available for braking in most cases if a pedestrian steps out in front of you and you have a choice between driving onto the sidewalk and hitting some pedestrians driving into the other lane and hitting some pedestrians or hitting the brakes real hard the correct choice is actually the brakes if the car was traveling at a safe speed which it will be it can stop before it hits the pedestrian especially if it has attention and sub human reaction times you dont code it to weigh the value of each life you just code it to safely avoid the accident if possible and if not possible minimize the impact forces theres no railroad switch because choosing who to kill is a false dichotomy based on imaginary physics
1045,the trolley problem is stupid because it operates under the assumption that a sdc wont have sensors in front of it feeding it information about the road ahead of it any problematic blind turn will have sensors on the other side of the turn so the car will know what is there something a human can not do
1046,except you dont need that many drivers on the road to spread the risk even if of people stop driving thats still million cars that need insurance not to mention the fact accident rates for those drivers are likely to go down
1047,when the sdcs hit majority of vehicle miles traveled i expect it to be very common for voters to insist that their municipalities regulate human drivers from making car registration drastically more expensive to making getting a drivers license more difficult to drastically raising the insurance requirement from in most states to several million to massive fines for violating the rules of the road or wreckless driving i expect things like blowing through a stop sign to have a several thousand dollar ticket and wreckless driving to carry criminal penalties when the majority of americans arent driving and view the remaining drivers as problem they are going to turn on them
1048,the second major limitation is that there will be strict maintenance requirements possibly even a maintenance contract that you pay in advance and the car will go get itself fixed by an authorized manufacturer approved mechanic likely at a dealership when it decides it needs something fixed which is a really good thing for all the other people that have to share the road with people who dont bother keeping up on maintenance
1049,not a warning to take over it would just pull off to the side of the road at worse case but likely pull into a repair shop
1050,in a difficult traffic situation to just pull to the side of the road might not be a trivial operation in the case of abrupt failure of a critical component the autopilot might not even know how to just pull off to the side of the road even in the best of times
1051,why would there be time to swerve if there isnt time to brake that is an extremely common situation a car turns in front if you a pedestrian steps in your path a deer or other animal crosses the road if there isnt oncoming traffic swerving around is the move when you dont have enough room to stop in time the problem is if the car wont swerve around a baby because a squirrel is blocking the lane that would be required to do so
1052,a simple case is if youre driving and a pedestrian lunges in front of the vehicle braking will not work the distance is too short continuing on the same path you will hit them swerving to avoid them and you could either hit another vehicle a bicycle or a crowd of pedestrians on a sidewalk swerving to avoid them might cause the vehicle to overturn and possibly injure the passengers what decision would you make too late youve hit the child in the road
1053,tldr some decisions need to made and the serious competitors in the space understand that it is highly situation dependent sdc will need to robust to some situations that need to have decisions made ie attempt to brake vs change lanes if you are on a high way and something falls off of a truck blocking your lane and you have an empty shoulder to your side i find it hard to justify not swerving into the shoulder if the braking distance is too short similarly if you are driving down a residential road and a child runs out into the road i expect the majority of the public to agree that the vehicle should attempt to avoid hitting the kid even if it ends with the vehicle hitting a parked car i dont think we will see cars getting to the point where they need to reason between very particular classes ie hit the nun vs the child the chances of these decisions coming up are rather low but i do think that we will see vehicles classify the occupancy grid around them as empty space person vehicle collidable object and non collidable object most sdc companies take their employees to a track to learn defensive driving and they teach how to swerve around obstacles for a reason they also cover situations such as how to recover from a spin due to a bad tire or the vehicle oversteering in a turn xb i think we see that companies which are reasonable while erring for caution and prioritizing safety will win out in the end ie the waymos and auroras of the world as opposed to the ubers
1054,i think people do take this scenario literally but i was under the impression it was a thought experiment to consider what are the moral implications of automating these things there must be some situation at some point where the ai takes finds itself in what we would think is a moral quandary even if this isnt it mind you i believe that the drastic reduction in accidents when we take human error off the roads is a fair trade off for some extremely rare scenarios where the ai is somehow at fault
1055,there are definitely situations swerving can work that stopping doesnt at highway speeds it takes the length of a football field to stop even assuming ideal road conditions and a properly maintained vehicle assuming something runs out in front of you its quite possible for it to be possible to swerve but not stop the real reason trolley problems have practically zero real world relevance is theyre exceptionally rare and predicted safety benefits from autonomous vehicles are magnitudes larger even if autonomous vehicles exploded ever time they were faced with a trolley problem and killed everybody within feet it would still be largely irrelevant
1056,surely the catch all solution would be to stay in your lane and brake depending on how fast youre going this could hurt the passenger although i agree that its probably easiest to control the safety inside of the car and make external decisions based on what improves safety outside the car why would there be time to swerve if there isnt time to brake because you keep going forward even when you brake even if you were to immediately crush the wheel by pressing relentlessly hard on it the wheels arent attached to the road so its still going to skid the idea of swerving is to redirect that momentum at a safer target that said some of these trolley problems are kind of contrived city and town roads are rated for their safest possible speed so its on par with your hair dryer burning your house down yeah technically both can happen but its so rare that we dont really plan society around it youd only run into trolley problem stuff going highway speeds but those are typically inaccessible to pedestrians and graded to maximize visibility the more likely dilemma is probably is it better to swerve into this other car right now drive off the highway or let this other car hit me which would likely send me into this other car anyways the answer is probably deploy airbags and drive off highway but i actually dont know that one but thats a little harder to visualize so people go with the pedestrian example
1057,if theres a pedestrian close enough to lunge in front of the vehicle then it already should have slowed down or changed lanes the same can be said about blind spots if were concerned about this slowing down traffic then we either need to make more sensors available to vehicles shared vehicle sensors stationary publicly accessible sensors or change our road designs like weve already done with highways to limit access and enhance visibility just because a vehicle is capable of going mph doesnt mean it should be going that fast if its not safe
1058,the wrong way driver is breaking the road law write that on your tombstone then
1059,actually you hit the oncoming car its much easier to mitigate andor avoid significant permanent damage for the human occupants of both cars than it is for a nakedunprotected human in the road
1060,there are other ethical situations where the pedestrian isnt at fault what if a car coming the opposite way swerves right in front of you at the last second your self driving car can brake all it wants but it may have to swerve in order to avoid the collision now what if there are pedestrians on the sidewalk of the road what would probably happen in that situation is that the car will allow the collision to happen since cars are designed for hitting each other and there would be nothing to protect swerving into the pedestrians that seems like the logical choice but there is another argument to be made too should the car protect the driver at all costs the driver is surrendering themselves and giving all trust and control in this car would it be ethical for it to allow the driver to be hurt over other people who arent involved with the car the reason people are talking about these hypothetical situations is because they will have to be decided before the situation becomes a reality these conditions will have to be explicitly set in the rules logic this isnt an area where we can say well see what happens these kind of decisions will have to be explicitly laid out and i think thats what people get hung up on a programmer will have to sit down and make the decision let my driver get hurt let the other driver get hurt let the bystanders get hurt an irobot model can even be applied where collision avoidance is based on a statistical survival model
1061,these type of scenarios will happen in urban and suburban areas where the speed limit is typically mph these are the typical stopping distances for humans http an autonomous vehicle doesnt have a human thinking distance they also apply the breaks accordingly unlike a typical human in many scenarios the vehicle may have even slowed down by mph in anticipation due to the nature of the environment such as dense parking of cars by the side of the ride can the vehicle avoid hitting a child that runs out into the road well if that child runs out within meters of the car then almost certainly not but what is really important is the speed in which the vehicle hits the child the weight of the vehicle and the makeup of the impact zone the fact is an autonomous vehicle is superior to a human it can detect that person behind an object that a human can not see if using an array of sensors it can anticipate their path so before a problem arises the vehicle will have already adjusted its speed and or positioning the problem is humans are thinking as humans when it comes to these scenarios an autonomous vehicle is not a human driver
1062,second the answer is simple you hit the child you apply the brakes as much as you can you keep the car straight so the brakes are effective you mitigate the damage as best you can in most situations like this veering around the road isnt a great idea it leads to a loss of traction and very possibly a loss of control just nail the brakes let the computers abs etc stop the wheels from locking
1063,the answer is simple you hit the child i disagree to a certain extent if its at all possible to avoid the kid i think that would be better eg you could swerve onto a footpath if its empty or use a parked car or guardrail for braking assistance but i would also accept your conclusion because thats probably what a human driver would do panic slam brakes ideally the two sdcs would see the kid approaching the road and talk to each other about the best way to act prior to the event eg hey opposing car a kid is about to jump in front of you i know you cant see it yet but trust me you should brake hard and swerve m to the right im braking and moving to my left to give you space edit i live in a left hand side of the road driving place
1064,if youre really concerned with everyones safety in that hypothetical story networked self driving cars are the best chance of no one getting hurt the cars will detect the child moving toward the street long before a human would and can run through all contingency plans and find the best one in addition the car will already be driving conservatively based on data obscured sides of road in a way that most humans wouldnt i suppose there are rare situations where something changes very suddenly and the laws of physics now dictate that something is going to get hit but even then the car can plan faster than a person could and minimize the damage
1065,years ago i took a shortcut through a residential neighborhood id never driven down those streets before but assumed they could lead me through to the next main road that i was seeking inherently i understood there was an additional risk of children playing and kind of mentally weighed the risk against my time saving benefit i was at or below the speed limit since i was having to wind my way about and as i had said i was not familiar with my path each turn was an arbitrary gamble then i saw a tiny glint of white from under a parked car i had zero clue what i saw but my mind did a natural calculation of trajectory and predicted an eminent collision i dont remember hitting my breaks but i locked all four wheels before the days of abs as i stood there at a standstill my heart sank into the pit of my stomach as a little blond haired girl continued her walk into the street this toddler was barely over bumper height and if not for the fact that her mom dressed her in white shoes that morning she most certainly would have met her fate ive thought times over what made me slam on my brakes that day and my only answer is that i felt i had to with every fiber of my being for all those who are involved in the decision making abilities of these automated systems i can only hope they will find the algorithm for gut feelings
1066,usage based electronic tolls for sdcs on congested city roads will automatically charge the owner or increase the passengers fee
1067,im not so sure it is as clear cut as that human and sdcs have to make assumptions about how others will act in order to function after all on a road without a divider any oncoming car could swerve into your lane at any point the only way to proceed is to assume that they wont likewise a pedestrian on the side of the road could jump out into the road at any time too traffic isnt going to slow down because someone might jump into the street however children are an exception to this rule most people will be more cautious around children a possible issue with sdcs could be that they might not be able to classify moving objects into categories fine enough to distinguish an adult from a child even if that is the case the superior sensors of a car should be able to make up the difference theyll be better at some things like not having blind spots or being distracted theyll be worse at others like not being able to recognize a situation developing that would cause a person to suddenly run into the road like for example another person about to throw them a ball taken as a whole though between the better sensors and reaction time sdcs should be much safer
1068,maybe not at first but those things could be ironed into the ai eventually and maybe theres information that other vehicles round the corner can broadcast for your car to receive like a kid sleding down a hill that you will have no way of knowing we may initially have better judgement with visual cues but we wont have the network of sensors sharing information about the surrounding areas through wireless communication you made an interesting point though
1069,scary movie plot threat the only sidewalk driving ive seen is bad drivers bored with waiting and endangering other road users yay selfies prevent that dammit im infected now
1070,and if i walk straight in front of the car stopping distance is now feet what if i cross the road in what feels a safe distance to me but the car feels otherwise
1071,and if i walk straight in front of the car stopping distance is now feet sorry that doesnt make any sense to me what if i cross the road in what feels a safe distance to me but the car feels otherwise you are going to have to be more specific braking distance at mph is meters the real question is how much can a car swerve at that speed while braking can a car swerve both left and right effectively in one movement because swerving only works if the object you are looking to avoid is stationary or moves in the opposite direction to the vehicle
1072,swerving almost always makes it worse just watch some dash cam videos see how many would be avoided if one car simply kept going straight and would have missed the other car all together most of these scary situations are irrelevant with sdcs here is why you are still thinking of an sdc a true sdc as being a solitary computer controlling a solitary car like you driving your car this is not how it would work first you can only see one very small thing in your fov at a time you have to move your vision plane around to see anything else so when you see someone walk out in front of you feet in front of you you can not do anything about it you wont even have time to swerve or even release the gas pedal this is an imposible scenario for the sdc the sdc will see you or more feet back it will know you are their and it will be tracking you and get this this is the important bit so will every other sdc in range visually of you so the car coming the other way will also see you the two cars will coordinate with each other share data they will both see you it will weight your existence as a probability and what it think you could do and constantly dozens of not hundreds of times a second re see you re measure you and re predict what it thinks you will do and so will the other car when you move the cars will already be acting before your foot gets inches into the road both cars will automatically begin to act if they can brake they will brake if they must swerve the car that was to hit you will swerve to miss you and coordinate with the other car to also swerve so it does not head on the other sdc this will all happen at cpu cycle speeds so insanely fast it will be like the flash or superman casually walking around at superspeed while the slow beings you move around like molasses slow and easy to predict it really can be that good you would have to get pretty damned creative to trick on sdcs will do what drives like me do but on a whole new level of insane eadd extremely aggressive defensive driving part of this driving is being proactive about possible dangers for example doing everything you can to avoid getting into a situation where you do not have outs available at all times directions you can go to avoid some trouble seeing a possible hey what if this guy does this or that situations and proactively changing your circumstances in advance even if he does nothing so that if he does your position to alter or avoid is improved sdcs will be able to do what i do on such an insane level that it will make what i do look like a squirrel trying to fly a starship
1073,i have a good true story to describe this i was driving home from egg harbor almost mile drive home from work brother wanted me to drop him off so the expressway made more sense than since i would have to backtrack once in pa to get to his place while if i took the express way he was on the way and would get home faster hell as long as he is paying the toll fine by me we are chugging down the expressway i am doing in the right lane mph psl this road has huge arching onramps so i see a car ahead on the onramp i slow down a little and then more when i check my six brother asks why i am slowing down i take the opportunity to explain my eadd driving to him i say see that onramp car he is going to be an intercept we will arrive at merge at the same time see the car passing me now he would have intercepted as well if i did slam on the brakes swerve hard left behind the passing driver still max braking take the shoulder and prepare still max braking to dive into the grass median if i need to brother bounces off the door window and slams into his loose restraints and goes wtf i just point forward now here is what happened when the onramp car arrived at the straight away wham deer standing in the lane he aggressively swerves left into the right lane to avoid the deer barely missing the passing guy who just passed us precisely where my little geo metro would have been had i not preemptively predicted not that this would happen but that if something did happen that spot is where i did not want to be it would have been a geo sandwich between those two much larger heavier cars it would not have been a good night if we even would have survived it i would have had zero outs i would not be able to go right as that would be into the merging car i would not have been able to go left as that would be into the passing car its a hp cylinder geo metro in th gear go faster is non existant in any useful time frame and braking would not have been sufficient in that timescale outs the only way to secure outs was toe change the odds slow down now so i am not between the cars at the single most dangerous point the merge point so i planned in advance by slowing to let them arrive ahead of me by checking at all to even notice the guy on my six passing me to check ahead that the shoulder and median are clear in case i need to use them do it long enough and this all just happens instinctively in your subconscious you just do it without thinking so much about it when you do it long enough and sdc with its perfect memory scanning and raw speed and higher resolution sensors and no distractions can do this so much faster than any person can and do it further and further away into the future and coordinate with other cars ideally in an sdc environment my car would slow and so would the passing car so that we would all reach the merge point staggered slightly without us the passengers even realizing it even if they all drive perfectly what if something happens their sensors can not see tire blows out causing a car to swerve anything eadd programming would solve this and we would never even know btw the passing car never flinched either he had depleted uranium balls or he never even saw anything and never knew how close he came to being whacked by that car swerving to miss the deer
1074,waymo is ahead because google wanted to do this over years ago they have had it on their mind as they build all their other stuff so today google has more data of the physical world than anyone else that they can leverage they know when there is an accident with waze they know when there is a traffic jam they can see the traffic light patterns and when the pattern changes they can see the data where there is a stop sign or even a stop sign has been removed waymo is using a database the cars drive from so if the database indicates a stop sign they stop they do not have to see the stop sign but if the database indicates a stop sign and there is non that they see they create an exception that is logged and the situation is looked into but google can also verify what is happening by using the human driver behavior that they get through google maps and google waze they know if a protest closes a road in real time if a parade they even know how busy a store is at a particular time they know when the stores open and close google has built up their data in prepartion for the data for self driving car robot taxi service and having far better utilization than anyone else but not just the data google has the infrastructure to support you need the ability to handle lots of data coming in make sense of it and get events to cars in real time sound familiar ultimately self driving cars is a software engineering problem google attracts the top engineers in the world so they basically get more first round draft choices than anyone once the cream of the crop comes in and is hire they then can take the cream of the crop of the cream of the crop and send them to waymo google created a virtual california that they can inject diffrent situations this is just vital for doing automated testing i have zero clue how gmforduber and the others are doing this i suspect they just are not why i cant see them getting to a safe solution you are making software and model changes you need to be sure that your change is not breaking something else you need to be able to first do virtual testing there is just so many other factors that favor googlewaymo than just being the only ones that have it working without safety drivers google has b in the bank for example with less than b debt they could buy gm and have plenty left over if they wanted to the piece googlewaymo is missing and nobody has is the car durability data today taxi companies buy regular cars they are not optimized for using as a taxi waymo will now collect data like there has never been before on the cars and that data will drive improvement in durability well beyond cars of today that will enable them to drive down the cost of self driving cars robot taxi service to be cheaper than using your own car within years ultimately waymo will use that data to build cars as it will ultimately be a competitive advantage but they should buy cars until they get the data gathered and then they should buy car making expertise and not do it organically then there is an entirely different angles that google has advantageous that nobody is close at having right now of the top apps used on all smart phones are owned by google enwikipediaorgwikilist_of_most_popular_smartphone_apps gm ford honda combined do not have a single one so there is discovery to summon a car google is unmatched in this area no other company close so you type car into search and a car shows up or you add a calendar event and you get a pop up do you need a car you write an email to get dinner with a friend next week and you both get a pop up do you need a car i saw a stat recently that new email accounts today are more than going to gmail they now have over billion active accounts but it is not only on your phone google in the smart speaker space has moved ahead of amazon even thought getting to the market years later move over amazon echo google home now sits upon the smart speaker throne home most popular speaker so you with google you can just be in your house and say car now and a car shows up gmfordhonda do not have smart speakers honestly never understood how any of this could be debated it is not like it is close now i am someone that does not believe people will be buying self driving cars does not make any sense to me that is people thinking the old world i also do not believe level will happen for decades and possibly not in my life time we have no idea how to do it it will not be as safe as level but there is probably not the financial benefits to spend the billions to do level ultimately it comes down to money we have no idea the processing power that would be required to do level it might be we are a long way from having the silicon to support i think it is far more likely level rolled out like you would roll out cell service area by area with the ones that make you the most money first with self driving cars it will also be driven by government regulation you can get to coverage in probably the next years with level you will then connect city to city so you do phoenix and do tuscon and then you do the highways inbetween eventually you are covering most of the us btw the confusion with level is caused by musk he is way smarter than i and knows better he says things that are simply ridiculous then people believe them the one i find most funny is having the hardware to do level we do not have the algorithms to do level so the idea of having the silicon to support is absurd how can you know that if we do not have algorithms
1075,tldr google stock is probably still undervalued this isnt a new tech product this is going to be a fundamental piece of the st century transport infrastructure and google is going to own it outright this is like railroads in the s this is a hundred year business even the self driving hype men are underselling this and theyre vastly underestimating how quickly it will happen
1076,i live and work in the center of where waymo is testing in arizona i havent seen a single car on the road without a safety driver i see a minimum of vans a day im also not convinced that the vans understand how to obey directions from a police officer for example when theres an accident and the police officer is redirecting traffic or when theres a traffic light out k order is a commitment to order not an actual order with a set delivery date from what ive read
1077,evidence we can see it in videos starting last year plus waymo has shared waymo is first to put fully self driving cars on us roads without a safety driver self driving safety driver chandler autonomous youtubeaaob eryqy but this is not new what is new is the commercial aspect later this year google was doing self driving in san fran years ago vvbcbjzupq waymo archives a self driving trip down lombard youtube some of the post on here are really surprising almost bizzare i think people have been living under a rock
1078,we can see disengagement rate we can see how many miles but was just reading today gm had one of their cars crash into another of their cars waymo only has one accident their fault in over million miles there is no shortcuts on how being done gm is several years behind but also has a disadvantage more broadly to compete i suspect gm is actually many more years behind then what they suggest how this is being done by everyone is very manual number of miles matter and variety of the miles waymo has tested all over the us think it is now different states and over different cities on cruise crash hardest thing self driving a cruise on cruise crash reveals the hardest thing about self driving tech edit my bad it is six states that waymo has tested but short changed them in cities tested in over cities that is physical world and more virtually waymo has also gone more than a billion miles in virtual world gm does not have infrastructure like google to do virtual world
1079,yes the drivers were in the drivers seat i have seen a van move once with someone in the back but it wasnt on a public road
1080,nearly million people die in road crashes each year on average deaths a day an additional million are injured or disabled road crashes cost usd billion globally costing individual countries from of their annual gdp deaths a day ok it will take time to spread globally but what a game changer add to this electric cars and we need both of these technologies sooner rather than later
1081,the average age of cars on the road in the us is years if fully autonomous sdcs are introduced in just a few years and it takes a few more for them to be widespread there will be dangerous morons behind the wheel for at least the next years it might not be your kids doing the driving but even a brilliant car is going to have trouble dodging someone driving drunk your kids kids yeah theyll probably be safe from cars
1082,i did an informal survey of my engineering friends about years ago to a person not one of them would let any of their kids anywhere near an sdc the kids ranged in age from to and included parents of driving teenagers where they admitted their kids were a hazard to themselves and others on the road they tended to worry about really strange rare situations where they admitted that even if they were with the younger kid or if their older kid was driving the outcome was still essentially chance but they would rather they or their kid killed themselves rather than software for younger kids they imagined roving gangs of kidnappers despite being aware of the mind boggling low rate of this occurring now less than per year for older driving age kids they still worried about the kid being kidnapped because the kid couldnt steer the car to safety or something like that for all ages the fact that they were x more likely to result in the death of their kids than an sdc still didnt hold up because while they agreed with the premise statistically they thought that they in particular could have better odds the good news is that none of this matters economics will push people to sdcs and well reap the benefits
1083,incentives can help clear the roads of idiot cars driven by people whod rather text than drive
1084,rate of production will be much higher for self driving cars since theyll be money making machines as soon as they come out of the production line theyll pay for themselves within a few months of ferrying passengers expect fleets to take over roads within a few years from the moment theyre mass produced and manual driving to be banned within that timeframe
1085,apparently cities will begin looking at thinning lanes since the sdcs wont need the margin of error humans do and will be salivating at the prospect of slicing off a full or so of the road surface area they need to build and maintain so i could see some incentives eventually for people to give up manual driving so they can make it happen a decade for that does sound right though
1086,while i agree with the above post that the average age of a car in the us is years that doesnt mean it will remain that way as the symbiotic relationship between sdcs and electric cars are relaized you can buy a chevy bolt today for less than k and it will cost you about year for depreciation electric insurance maintenancetires a new ice car will cost closer to kyear because of gas and higher maintenance but outside of a tesla electric is still a hard sell because consumers are unsure how it will workout for them as sdcs are rolled out as a service its much easier for a consumer to dip their toes into the electric car pool since they arent committing to a huge capital investment as consumers decide that an sdc fleet works for them as their nd or rd car and for some all their cars the average age of cars on the road should fall pretty fast as the nd and rd cars are mostly where these older cars are each car you own has to justify you spending k kyear on them when you can spend k kyear using an sdc fleet try this first figure up how much each of your cars cost you per year by calculating the depreciation gas costs insurance costs maintenance taxes etc this should be between k k even if you have a year old beater like i do then ask yourself if you would keep paying this if you had an uber like service where you could request and have a car in your driveway within minutes that would take you anywhere in town for would you keep your car
1087,google could provide some other statistics that would be useful to see how ready for the road their cars are the main one would be how many times say per miles that the driver had to take over and a rough idea of what would have happened if the driver didnt take over eg blocked traffic strike another vehicle strike a person my thought is that if the driver takes over in difficult situations then the accident rate doesnt tell us a lot
1088,i have a dash cam and i have captured some people doing really dumb shit ive only had the cam less than months and ive caught someone turning at a left turn light and cutting me off exactly like the example in the google car someone running a red light and nearly hitting me someone driving on the wrong side of the road and numerous other smaller things and i dont drive much at all i take public transportation to work we seriously need these cars now
1089,i didnt understand that picture dilbhltxcloudfrontnetmax kykahjkdvilozqsl is it a x ways symbolically separated locally by some dirt i thought it was two independent x roads
1090,mdata m e m m sxfbbec xcdabafb m e well i took a shot at finding it in mountain view since thats where they said it was and i think i found it this is the area where it happened those cars going the wrong way were headed north on north shoreline drive my guess is that they drifted into the left turn lane at the crossroads of monticitostierlin and without realizing it crossed the street cleanly over into the other left turn lane and the rest is pretty much history
1091,it can happen if someone pulls out in front of you for example your choices might be to either hit his car or swerve to avoid it but in doing so hit people crossing the street a self driving car would need to be programmed to hit the car instead of veering into the people even though that is the safer option for the occupants i have seen plenty of examples of those situations just visit rroadcam
1092,sdc technology should be illegal on roads until the technology exists to count how many children are in two school buses so it knows to crash into the one with kids instead of the one with kids and one chimpanzee
1093,its amazing how many stupid things all drivers do have you seriously never made a mistake yes there are drivers that are dumber than you are at driving but a very large portion of the mistakes you see on the road are the result of a normal driver doing a dumb thing rather than a dumb driver just being
1094,idiot humans wont deliberately murder everyone aboard to save a cardboard cutout of a movie star idiot humans make judgement errors the_yar is insisting on a machine that would intentionally throw a bus down a mountain if the plausible alternative is flattening one yahoo running across the road if were talking about systems that are even capable of such philosophy ethics decisions they should be making better choices than rorschach would
1095,it is machine it will fail there is no machine in existence which has not failed at something and i am not talking here about cars i am talking about machines in general beside the point the point is if machines fail less often than humans then we will end up favoring the machine human error is far more acceptable than machine error no both are unacceptable we prosecute humans all the time for manslaughter with cars who is at fault when the machine fails the manufacturer will be at fault they will defend their case with copious evidence that they were not at fault there are lots of sensors and therefore tons of evidence sdc will drive very defensively and i bet they can get it to the point where the liabilityrisk is worth the reward theyll probably carry liability insurance per the number of sdc carsmiles driven the cost of this insurance will drop as the number of safe miles driven piles up now having people killed because a smartass somewhere thought ill make it hit the smaller object is not an acceptable outcome in any situation again you might think youre awesome and not a smartass but i recommend you listen to the horror stories from people who have killed people on bikes or children who ran out into a road and tell me whether or not you think you can do better than them computers can and will do a better job driving than humans accidents involving machines that make their own decisions happen already with machines a lot dumber than these cars they will continue to happen all humans have to do is make sure the tradeoff between human decision making and computer decision is safe enough to try did you know that airplanes land themselves on a regular basis that in fact they land themselves in conditions that humans would find difficult http enwikipediaorgwikiautoland
1096,planes land on a strip that has no other obstacles they have enough room to maneuver flying a plane still has a large number of unpredictable variables wind mechanical failure etc they are programmed to deal with a lot of that or else you wouldnt see it used ill generally agree that cars encounter more but there is also a better out if this go wrong the car can simply be stopped the manufacturer is clearly at fault in those cases yet i have never heard of them having to pay and people still fly imagine that same will happen with the cars some guy somewhere will make a decision write it in software it will kill people it will be deemed acceptable yes i certainly hope so because its still human error it already happens its nothing new you take a chance everytime you go outside all sdc cars have to prove is that by and large they do a better drive driving than humans once that is definitely proven they will be let onto roads they will have lots of evidence to show that
1097,the minute these cars are only twice as dangerous as human cars id be legalizing them and allowing them to sell to the public saving millions of man hours of drivers time and freeing it up to work or play is worth that alone some vehicles on the road today are already half as safe as others so it isnt really any worse than allowing a few more trucks with shoddy brakes on the road as soon as they start exceeding human safety records id be looking into making the technology compulsory in new cars to save lives just like seatbelts crumple zones and airbags are compulsory today
1098,i feel like quietly is unnecessary in the headline what do other redditors think casual passer by i have not read the article edit having read the article i think its important for google to publish transparency reports at this time im a robotics engineer in silicon valley and i understand that self driving cars are a technology that can work but i also feel like its a matter of public safety that we know who is testing self driving vehicles on the road and what happens with them google has business interests here but we also have public safety to consider im not worried about public safety with google but i am worried about the newly funded start up that thinks they can be secretive even when their tech is experimental ive heard rumors of self driving car start ups that test highly experimental software on public roads google can set an example here if they choose
1099,agree on your bottom line i drove it this morning and it did some things much better like pull out of my road and not wait forever at the stop sign however right when approaching a light it tried to swerve quickly from the left turn lane to the right lane for no reason left blinker was on i dont believe it has the right sensors in the right locations on the car to ever get to l or even l
1100,i dont believe well see fsd reaching l and i dont think were going to see any of the av companies get to l for a very long time but for different reasons than your post i do see fsd reaching l on pre validated stretches of road ive been following fsd for about a year now and your write up today demonstrates progress months ago the typical post mortem reddit post would have listed far more safety disengagements on the same amount of mileage i dont feel that the non safety disengagements you listed are reasons to doubt fsds foundations standardized conditional speed limit signage and contextual hand gesture recognition are both within the realm of possibility to be programmed into a computer today my guess is that tesla has their efforts focused on more fundamental aspects of fsd that have more unknowns such as their vision only perception we do know that the perception engine is capable of perceiving unclassified obstacles in the road though the visualization doesnt show them anymore i do not know what kinds of work theyve done to be able to classify objects as being safe to drive over but again this isnt really an unsolvable problem and doesnt require human judgement so im not really convinced by your first or second point theyre fighting an uphill battle with their comically under powered sensor suite yet im impressed with how far theyve managed to get with it yes their vision only system does have a big error margin but it doesnt need to be tightened much further to make it suitable for a lot of driving i dont see fsd reaching l until they do the following fully embrace high fidelity mapping implement a teleguidance system that can loop a human in when human judgement is required double their compute power to offer full redundancy add sensor redundancy and improve sensor positioning however even if they do not do these things i feel that the system could one day be capable of l driving on pre validated roads particularly closed access roads and highways imo this would be great to have on a personally owned vehicle
1101,i worry tesla lives in a cartoon universe in which a handful of objects are all that exists your worry is exactly how it works something to consider though is that crumpled cardboard box could easily still contain something that will damage your car so allowing the car to hit it is a bad idea regardless someone i know hit what they thought was just a plastic bag in the road except there was a brick in the bag and it destroyed their wheel and the suspension getting a service appointment for your car right now to get parts replaced would be a month long mission
1102,thanks for you writeup as for perception the object level detection does not imply a cartoon world understanding as you imply greentheonly and others showed the visualization of voxel density maps around the cars which do show things where no icons exist for they are just not additonally marked on the main ui s about the other driver indicating i am sure the car would have not waited indefinitely and waiting longer in a situation like this is definitely not the end of the world or unsolvable or a valid assessment of whether or not the engineers do not understand the world in any case those two cases would also appear to be an issue for all other teams trying to do it more difficult road signs are indeed interesting especially parking signs will be an issue in many places for some time but those can be solved heuristically for a time eg only park in these kinds of locations
1103,regarding the speed limits i think if and when autonomy is realized we will need a more foolproof machine readable way of indicating speed limits a localized broadcast a real time ota update a qr code on the signs something like that one of the big challenges with autonomous driving is we have to start at the hard end of the problem humans driving in a human world over time as there are fewer humans on the road the roads themselves can and will be equipped to aid the robot drivers to be more efficient and safer
1104,you bring up some good points about issues around road debris and wordy signs but it seems like a leap from that to thinking it will take a decade to solve
1105,waymo is l like cruise zoox and all of the other robo taxi companies like you pointed out waymos have no human driver so they must be at least l an l vehicle would require a human in the seat to take over at any time waymos can be driverless because their sensor suite and compute have sufficient redundancy they are capable of querying for human judgement when needed teleguidence their geofence is thoughally mapped and validated by humans the last point is very important fsd without a geofence must posses human comprehension to understand complex signs and weird roads and intersections however if you constrain your operational domain to a set of mapped and validated roads you can ensure that all of the special signs in that area are programmed into the computer before it leaves the depot basically my point is you cannot teach a computer to think but if you give the computer the right constraints you can do all of the thinking for it up front so i think tesla _could_ accomplish l on pre validated stretches of roads with only incremental levels of improvement they would also benefit from some better sensor placement but for tesla to accomplish l meaning a human doesnt need to be in the drivers seat theyd have to adopt many of the constraints that elon likes to give shit to robo taxi companies about so the tesla robo taxi future where your car generates hundreds of thousands of dollars for you while you sit at home probably wont be happening at least with anything that looks like a tesla today
1106,computers have exceeded humans in text reading for a while now only if you mean visual recognition of letters and words even large language models like gpt are nowhere near human level comprehension its best results are still largely cherry picked and it makes face palm inducing mistakes all the time nowhere near ready to safely navigate roads based on the text comprehension of signs and other safety indicatorswarningsetc
1107,i was thinking smaler stuff where the remote operators could take over after the car has come to a stop but with only a few seconds delay of course its hard to think of exact situations where this would be nessecary if they were easy to think of then they would be easy to program exceptions for but as a scenario off the top of my head say cows were blocking the road if i was driving i wouldnt really have to think twice to know to approach them slowly to get them to move but a computer probably couldnt figure this out and would be stuck there i know its a stupid example but stuff like that comes up all the time when youre driving you may not give much thought to it but any odd situation would be enough to confuse the car with no human in the loop theres no way to resolve the situation
1108,too many japanese people speak english brain drain is that a joke or have you just never been to japan studying abroad not to mention emigration practically doesnt happen anymore its closing on itself as a country and the youth is leading the charge
1109,the video was quite deceptive it was not nearly so dark here is a photo of the site imgurcomgalleryxqrab here is a video as a normal driver would have seen the road vplpe puoifeatureyoutube
1110,youre right uber is at fault that doesnt mean sdc tech should be at fault this uber did not have technology that is safe for driving on its own on public roads it had incomplete unfinished technology and uber knows this therefore uber did not and has not deployed this technology thats why they were testing it so they can make it better this accident is due to human error and perhaps poor company practices
1111,i think by the rules of the road if the uber was a human driver they would be ok this probably means they arent legally liable but they will no doubt pay a tidy settlement to make this go away the issue is that autonomous vehicles should be achieving a higher standard of safety not the legal minimum it might well set back their av program with the regulator
1112,doesnt really matter the car didnt even slow down that is a problem it isnt like she jumped in front of the car she slowly walked across the road and the car plowed over her i might be more sympathetic if the this was a human driver but not for a machine in this case sdc did worse than a human driver would and that is unacceptable
1113,are you saying that she was crossing the road legally or that she crossed illegally but jaywalking isnt an accurate term for what exactly she did
1114,but she didnt break that law she was already in the act crossing an empty road when the uber car came around the corner
1115,she was crossing the road legally in order to do so you must simply give right of way to cars that you can see when you begin to cross if she stepped out in front of the uber car when crossing the road she was jay walking but she didnt shed been crossing the road for some time
1116,did you even read the law or watch the video her crossing outside of a crosswalk was against the law the road was straight no corner for the car to come around im going to assume you are trolling at this point
1117,i could see the argument if the testing is done on a closed trackcoursefacility but if the testing is done on public roads why would sae levels not apply the important distinction is that for l the car manufacturer is not responsible as you mentioned in this case its kinda moot because the safety driver was an uber employee i wonder if this accident will cause a shift in the industry where everyone fires their safety drivers creates a separate driver staffing company hires their drivers back and puts them back in the cars that way if another accident happens uber can say we are not responsible this was an l car it was being operated by a safety driver and we do not employ him you will have to talk to the staffing company rebu
1118,i gave a broad answer because in the us is very state dependent and theres always the case of other countries which i have some but not much experience with for example ca is a partial fault state so the fact that you cut someone off as reckless driving doesnt reduce the fault of the person behind not keeping a safe distance and being unable to stop in time unless that cut in was done in a way that the driver behind was unable to keep such distance or in most south america countries where it is the driver in the back responsibility to prove the front one was reckless tldr this can get tricky and nuanced quickly very fast to the point it doesnt fit a reddit discussion but i agree with all you said depending on where in the world you are
1119,isnt autopilot a requirement to enter the boring companys tunnels would that count as a road that has human drivers banned
1120,initially i can only see some highways bypasses or even just a separated lane on certain roads becoming sdc only to the benefit of safety and efficiency we might also see neighborhoods with specific ordinances or tax breaks encouraging homeowners to own and use sdcs i honestly cant see human driven cars going away completely for a very long time culture will preserve them for as long as they can be maintained or restored also great portions of rural and even urban areas arent marked or well maintained enough to accommodate the theoretical sdcs without controls owners of human driven vehicles will definitely push back against any new laws or government funded infrastructure that does not apply to them you know nimbyisms and such
1121,regulations regarding when a vehicle is road worthy front white lights yellow trun indicatorswarnings rear red lights horn minimum side mirrors and rear view mirror seatbelts and airbags etc plus clear regulations that arent really followed regarding driving in public roads if you go to any sort of industrial setting vehicles are also fitted yellow strobes on top have mostly designated lanesspaces must be driven by a higher certified driver for the specific vehicle involved and vehicles with lesser visibility require a spotter plus radio comms and supervisors there is also a focus on making streetsinfrastructure safe and predictable all this things combined still make transit related incidents the leading cause of death of youth close to teenagers are killed each year in car crashes nationwide making traffic collisions the leading cause of accidental death among teens ages to according data from the insurance institute for highway safety iihs accidents still leading cause death among teens red flag laws might seem ridiculous from our perspective but the goal of making operating heavy machinery more than ton at high rates of speed kph trough dense urban areas as safe as possible must remain at the heart of when and how we allow vehicles to operate in our communities
1122,fun fact some car manuf will actually broadcast fake engine sounds into the cabin because efficient engines are too quiet and arent as satisfying to drive
1123,this is a dumb unnecessary law driving under the influence is already illegal passing this could have implications down the road when we get to level
1124,teslas stuff has been on the roads for years now have you seen any case they lost or made a payout if corps had to take the losses they wouldnt sell it
