0,well depends what were talking about if were talking private cars its definitely not the solution if were talking public transport it does have an impact im working in this field trying to test autonomous shuttles in connection with existing connections it would make public transport cheaper safer more inclusive and more efficientit would indeed make jobs disappear but part of them will further exist just în the office looking at a few shuttles at a time also we are studying on demand transport and are trying to have a lead start with this before uber and co so that it stays public at the same time we are trying to see how the gathered data can help us its a field worth exploring even if we dont yet know what all the advantages are it could at some point make owning a car obsolete since you can just call a bus through an app

2,its able to do this because its not an illusion in degree giving up autonomy is a very very hard sell ask anyone whos dealt with negotiating the keys away from an elderly loved one who isnt really safe to drive anymore some kind of expanded sharing model with ubiquitous easy mass transit like trains trams etc is probably the way it could play out in the end
3,i think once autonomous cars are the norm the majority of accidents will be caused by people being demonstrably bad drivers doing the wrong thing on the road so the automated car couldnt react safely and once that happens i think thered be a strong public safety argument to do such a ban im honestly not sure if id support it but i can see that the argument would reasonably exist

5,no i would never support a ban of non autonomous vehicles there will always be people who are not comfortable with the technology plus it is extremely unlikely the technology will be accident proof in our lifetimes or even before or possibly after the technology would have to be absolutely accident and failure free before anyone jumps in with of course it will be safe by xxxx year you need to go back and look at the things predicted to be commonplace now that arent here yet or even coming along anytime soon
6,my concern is cost even if ai gets perfected to the point that autonomous driving is demonstrably safer than humans tomorrow how much would that feature add to the cost of a car how long before you can get an old beater with ai will it even be something you can merely buy once or will it end up as so many things are as a costly subscription as much as id love a self driving car and as much as it would make the roads safer if everybody had one there are lots of people who will never be able to afford a new dumb car let alone a smart one the requisite hardware for autonomous driving would not only have to be good and reliable and safe it would also have to get cheap enough that it doesnt price entry level buyers out of the new car market and will have to be around long enough that there are plenty of old cheap autonomous cars available for those who cant afford new at a guess id say youd need to wait about years after autonomous cars became mainstream before even thinking about legislation even then youd have to start with merely requiring the feature for new model years like we did for backup cameras a few years ago maybe another decade after that you could start financially disincentivizing human driven cars insurance surcharges and whatnot in the end i dont think youll ever need to ban them theyll just become too old and too expensive for any but hardcore enthusiasts to bother keeping years after ai driving becomes a standard feature cars without the feature will be years old think about cars that are years old now would you want to drive one every day theyre so old that theyre either rusting into the ground or have gone through the old and cheap phase and come out the other side into the realm of expensive classics sooner or later cars without ai will be like cars without fuel injection or abs or air conditioning theyll exist but theyll all have historic plates and theyll only get driven to car shows

8,freedom inherently comes with risks some safety measures should just be encouraged not enforced i mean it would technically be in the publics best interest to stay home all day and never interact with strangers but a free society is always going to be vulnerable to dangers and the effects of bad decision making

10,this is a delicate question it depends on a lot of factors there would be vast differences in attitudes between urban suburban and rural drivers their access to public transport would be vastly different as well and their access to features such as wireless charging accident avoidance infrastructure communication vehicle to vehicle for example would all be different based on whats available also there is a major set of people who enjoy driving this could continue via private roads though which would mostly be a large improvement in liability and safety driving could be a dedicated hobby which may prove out to be excellent compared to today

12,in a theoretical future where autonomous cars are safe enough under all conditions cheap enough that theyre at least as accessible to low income people as cheap cars are today and both of those things have been true for many years already then i would support a ban on non autonomous cars with a generous transitional period were like years away from that though
13,no just like other safety features and designs three point seatbelts airbags sloping hoods so pedestrians go over the vehicle instead of under it in the event of a collision etc the change will occur naturally over time that technology is still long way off and even when its finally arrived it will be expensive to implement a total ban on vehicles that dont incorporate the technology would present an undue burden on the public since most people wouldnt be able to afford the switch immediately but sooner or later just like backup cameras it will become a standard feature of all vehicles even economy ones so as time progresses all cars will naturally be autonomous unless youre suggesting the government implement a massive trade in so that every american gets one for free but even then that would probably just create a monopoly for whichever company creates the technology first which would also be bad also until true ai is a thing even autonomous vehicles will require manual driving for lots of things rural areas would be particularly hard hit by such a ban since the technology as its currently progressing only works well in urban and suburban environments anyone who drives long distances on the regular will tell you how often gps will drop when youre out in the boonies

15,wed yet to prove that autonomous cars are statistically safer than manned cars there simply isnt enough data to conclude anything at this point if it turns out theyre only marginally safer then no i would not support a ban

17,i think the main issue is that when we have a blend of non autonomous and autonomous cars sharing the same roads autonomous cars are going to get bullied like crazy people are going to recognize that they can cut them off and they will yield every time because their programming insists on them being safe this will piss off the owners of autonomous vehicles and eventually lead to the exclusion of non autonomous vehicles from certain roads likely federal interstates first
18,the elements of individual freedom dont matter we dont let people drive without a seat belt just because they want to because we understand how unsafe that decision is well rather because insurance companies leaned on the govt to write that into law because it saves them money on claims but it has the added benefit of also being the safer decision this kind of ban is a long time from being enforceable on a practical level though like literally decades were only now getting to the point where a majority of vehicles have current autonomous safety features lane departure prevention distracted driving warnings etc and thats not even fully autonomous realistically were probably years away from the point where most vehicles are fully autonomous thats the earliest i can see enforcing this kind of legislation and even then it would be more like states wont issue registration for vehicles that arent autonomous rather than an actual ban and some people will still try to ignore it because there will always be that segment of the population that arrogantly believes they can drive better than a computer

21,i present to you the official pennsylvania horse and buggy operator manual in california the horse and the rider actually has right of way in many cases if the rider signals for you to slow down and you hit their animal youre held liable in fact they even have new safety laws that went into effect a couple days ago mandating helmets for under riders and reflectors on your horse when riding on the highway after dark new california traffic safety laws sideshows chp

23,i dont think it would be acceptable to ban one form of transport for safety reasons for another that was not safe in addition if its between someone being able to get around or not because they dont trust the technology then they should be able to drive themselves comfort has always outweighed lives saved approximately million people are killed in fatal crashes each year on average thats about deaths a day globally an additional million are injured or accident statistics no one has banned cars yet

25,im not an actuary so i dont know the answer to that question theres also the school of thought that believes that a sharp spike sticking out of the steering wheel is a better road safety mechanism than seatbelts so maybe your spike thing should not only be allowed but encouraged

27,by or so it might be fairly rare to even see gas cars and stations will be shutting down left and right that alone will be a struggle for older vehicles also isnt one of the ideas of autonomous cars the idea that using them as a rental service like uberlyft will be cheap enough to have a lot of people switch to that mode of transport i suspect that may just be a pipe dream however if gas stations became rarer and rideshares became a lot cheaper it might just push even the poorest people to self driving as well also theres a good chance self driving cars can interact far more safely with other self driving cars since they will act predictably once we get the systems fully capable while human drivers can be erratic and dangerous and it wouldnt take many of them to even slow traffic down
28,thats a fair point to raise but its still an arbitrary point to place a line in the sand it has less to do with legal freedom but most people already have no freedom mentally or physically to cross the sea most have to rely upon technology or professionals to make that trip why draw the line there on how farwhere you can travel without the reliance on others the easiest place to draw the line truly is with walkingbiking if you have the need to travel great distances thats going to require some level of sacrifice no matter how you look at it also more specifically addressing your concern we already do not have the liberty to use any old vehicle on public roads in many places it has to meet certain standards and its tested periodically according to those standards emissions safety etc a transition to autonomous is just one additional rung up the ladder you might not be okay with that but to me its very arbitrary and i disagree that its a concern for the losses that well experience we will gain just as many benefits with a transition to autonomous

32,its not about if an ai can drive better than i can its very likely that ai will eventually reach a point where no human can drive safer than ai its about the comfort i feel of being in control of my own vehicle having the freedom to drive my car at exactly the speed i want on the exact route i want and pulling over at the exact spot i want completely autonomous vehicles would force me to be a backseat driver in my own car which i would hate

34,i mean honestly we ought to be doing it now edit i approached this thread assuming we were talking about an ideal world scenario obviously this would be shouted down because any attempt to substantively improve street safety especially for non car users gets shouted down i mean look at all the entitled responses in this topic by people whose identity is so wrapped up in their cars they cant think of anyone who isnt behind the wheel of a machine is less than fully a person you ask that they consider a way to get from a to b that doesnt impose so many externalized costs on others and they act like youre trying to amputate their feet or something

36,theoretically yes but in practice making sure an autonomous car is safe to people around it on its own is impossible the variables are simply too large this is why im saying it would worry me to only allow autonomous cars on the road because the only way to make it safe is to bannot allowed pedestrians access to the road other than specified crossing points and to ban non autonomous traffic too bye bye cyclists i was watching a video about how jaywalking was invented by the auto industry as a way to sell safer roads when in reality it was setting the car at the top of the highway hierarchy by stopping pedestrians getting in the way and creating car centric urban planning policy particularly in cities it makes zero sense to privilege autonomous cars on the road and on a tangent i dont think cars electric andor autonomous will be the solution to traffic or climate change in the future mass transit and public transport is much better at solving those problems

43,i dont generally worry about those things now anymore than i worry about buildings collapsing on me when i walk down the street we have laws signage and licensing for a reason we also teach our children to watch out for cars what i do worry about is my and my familys safety in the event of the failure of any one of the hundreds of systems required for autonomous driving i worry that if the cascadia quake hits and cell service goes out then i cant get anywhere in my truck be it to get supplies like water or to get my family to our trailer

53,i dont know if it will be a small minority of people judging by the replies in this thread i enjoy throwing axes i dont throw them in public because theyre dangerous if they hit someone instead i go to a range where i can throw them in a safe environment it still isnt safe but its in an out of the way place where everyone consented to be im sure in there will be hobbyist courses where people can enjoy the thrill of the open road just as long as back here in my neighborhood cars always yield at crosswalks not just some of the time when their owners are feeling generous
54,those types of techniques can certainly reduce the incidence of false positives but in situations with enough vehicles and specular reflective surfaces your system can easily have very low confidence i used to work with vector templating system that can auto align using lasers and retro reflective material and even with all the tricks we lock out the ability to align two heads at the same time that are too close together these types of visual systems are very sensitive to interference i mean i worked on systems that needed thou accuracy on stationery mounts but i can certainly see a half dozen lidar scanners in very close proximity causing enough interference to atleast lower the confidence enough to make them significantly less reliable not to mention due to the fact that if a company wanted to use visible light lasers for improved range eyesafe and r systems are still incredibly distance limited for dynamically mounted sensors generally use at least other machine vision technology is needed to have adequate active track most of the vehicles that i have seen equipped with lidar systems are also using or other additional methods like machine vision with cameras and actual radar there is a reason we dont see automotive lidar on vehicles outside of experimental self driving applications and close to the ground warehouse autos controlled by a single server or coordinated through a hivemind iot architecture that is also supported by a server teslas decision to forgo lidar altogether didnt happen by accident its far easier to coordinate disparate devices when the scanners you are using arent emitters
55,it is really only a problem for generating false positives in other cars lidars so the technology making it safe for autonomous cars to drive makes it unsafer for other autonomous cars seems like a fatal design flaw

57,autonomous vehicles can still operate in the vast majority of the country by area where it would make no sense economically to deploy area level command and control systems autonomous vehicles can operate and improve safety on an individual vehicle level without requiring massive additional infrastructure investment in deployment and ongoing maintenance if a lidar on a vehicle breaks it affects that vehicle if whatever positioning sensor youre deploying at command stations breaks it wrecks the entire area controlled by that station the amount of information required to be collected and transmitted to each vehicle in order to provide overall network optimization is enormous people will definitely not want to participate in a system where their car ends up choosing being commanded in your scenario to sacrifice their own travel time or god forbid safety to improve overall traffic flow against their will these are some of the many reasons why autonomy is the much lower hanging fruit than centralized control

59,you bring up good points i actually work on lidar for vehicles in my current position and so far i dont know of any oems that plan to rely on only one sensor type for the autonomous driving systems besides tesla using vision only lidar has its place in the sensor suite but a lot of the hard work happens at the sensor fusion level and the ai built into the computers taking all the sensor data in and processing it those systems can identify when they are in a situation where the lidar is not the most reliable sensor to take data in and adjust accordingly in the short term lidar is an improvement in safety for collision detection and automatic breaking systems to avoid the collision vs the existing sensors so it helps to enable the intermediate autonomous driving levels before getting to fully autonomous operation

61,unlikely become more likely doesnt necessarily mean it becomes likely because we dont know what unlikely means if the current error rate from external lidar is such that it would happen once per hundred years but it needs to fail multiple times per second to have real danger from it there is a lot of safety decrease that can ignored

63,no no the systems i worked on were static eyesafe long and short range class and class r lasers which could do ft before the accuracy falls off too much infrared lasers have to contend with more interference as basically everything in the outdoor environment emits or reflects basically every frequency of infrared increasing the chance of false positives especially when you add a bunch of additional sources by attaching lidar emitters to the top of every vehicle i am saying that even if manufacturers went the obnoxious route to use visible lasers to reduce false positives it still wouldnt be good enough for an active lidar only system mounted to a vehicle in a chaotic environment the short comings of lidar active tracking are handled by adding additional sources of environmental information like cameras and radar
64,lidar do not operate at lwir wavelengths that usually um most lidar are either nm um or nm um nm is considered eye safe these are considered swir wavelengths
65,you could also shine a bright flashlight in the drivers eyes its like airplanes there are lots of security holes that we know how to fix but the fixes would increase cost so much that people wouldnt fly on the safer planes consumers wont pay k for bulletproof windshields and they wont pay k for a radar thats resistant to malicious jamming

67,yes if the cars are sharing data then cars could react to things they cant yet sense going around a corner a lead car or a car coming from another direction could detect an animal in the road and tell the cars behind it to slow down maybe there are changing road conditions like a puddle mudslide ice etc this would not only make other self driving cars safer but it would potentially give human drivers more time to react leading to fewer secondary accidents pileups also as of last year googles car used lidar for small details which has problems in the rain snow so a car might not be able to accurately sense the road conditions until the traction control system tells the car about it which doesnt happen until the tires actually drive over the surface synced cars would make them all safer by giving them more data to base their decisions on

69,the exact same attack can be done on a human driver with nothing but a high powered flashlight at the end of the day you cant make anything perfectly safe against an attacker with unlimited time and funds to develop an attack thats the lesson weve learned from millenia of war offense will always win given enough time and money as silly as it seems if you want to kill someone badly enough you could get a nuke on the black market and simply vaporize their autonomous car
70,are you an engineer at honda or just an employee i have two questions about their safety features in the touring cr v that i was really curious about but i dont think theyd answer it if i asked someone officially specifically with the adaptive cruise control lane keeping assist system could you basically jump on a straight road hit the cruise and let go and the car will keep you going if nothing interferes the other question was just something i dont have the guts to test will adaptive cruise control stop the car if it approaches a barrier or does it go down to the mph that cruise stops working and just cut out

72,note that cars have both camera and radar but it is scary to think that a driverless car will allow someone totally asleep to be driving along unable to react if the machine is compromised no different from a rear seat passengfer in a car if the driver has a fit at speed what can said passenger do or a passenger in an aircraft those things dont actually need pilots anymore but the lawyers wont let us get rid of them so we still have manual air traffic control and everytime one crashes its human error theyd be safer uncrewed

74,i do believe that agi will happen sooner than most lay people believe but slower than many technologists believe that is to say within the next years in terms of what happens after we have possibilities agi does everything we could come up with and theres no point in us even trying want to cure cancer if feasible agi will beat you to it so we live well as a result agi takes control and acts in ways we hadnt anticipated many people have expressed worries about this personally i belong to neither camp i think we will have many challenges with ai in the next years those ill hopefully result in lots of safeguards being put in place we will likely live in fear that we might lose control but that fear will alone cause many checks and balances to be put in but i do agree with elon musk and many others who were involved in the famous open letter on ai that the concerns are real enwikipediaorgwikiopen_letter_on_artificial_intelligence i am optimistic well do the right things along the way to just about keep it under check
75,sure there is potential for abuse but the same is true of any new technology you could also say that cars themselves are a danger because they move so much faster than horse drawn carriages people will die from problems with driver less cars the question is will more lives be saved overall from the safety improvements i would say yes

77,i dont think that wireless communication between cars to synchronize them is a very good idea specifically because of the possibility of a rogue meatbag driven car there is also the problem of the protocol design say that cars are in lanes a b c d first cars are a b c d seconds are a d and so on how do you have cars relate to each other i mean how car c knows that hes behind c and besides b apparently the protocol would need to have a function that asks whos the car besidesin frontbehind me does car d really needs to know what b is doing the sheer number of cars going around all saying im going at such speed or i just passed the corner of hollywood and vine or hey i get a soft tyre would likely overwhelm the communication system no matter how terse the protocol is and would that protocol be guaranteed or every packet would be like a udp packet sent and forgotten in that case the wireless would not be vital for the safe operation so then in the kiss spirit why bother with wireless and only rely on environmental sensing lastly since google cars sense their environment by a laser scanning system it could be conceiveable that they could run at night without headlights and that the laser colour could also pierce through fog
78,i see your point for overall safety and agree to an extent unfortunately it will take the lives of those whom befall the shortcomings of our trust in this technology to bear out the eventual statistical answer perhaps we should look instead at this technology as a better mass transit solution rather than individual owner option let that be the litmus test before we go full into this commercial automata that would also give the brunt of the infrastructure build and design on the local government vs the individual consumer having to flesh this thing out sorry i ramble

80,this may always be an issue just as a sudden overpass collapse or a drunken driver going the wrong way are also possible there will be incidents where vehicles are involved in accidents however i think the point of developing a massive networked and semi autonomous systems is that in cases of accident a car accident will result instead of a car pile up whats more in such a circumstance traffic can be rerouted you dont have looky loo problems and emergency services will be alerted and arrive that much sooner its not about being foolproof but being vastly more efficient and safer than our human run system

90,to me it seems less about monitoring and more about complete centralized control of all trains decentralized automatic train safety systems have existed in one form or another for a long time im sure they already had plenty of monitoring because it would be ridiculously cheap to just superglue a smartphone running a nanny app onto every locomotive the thing that bothers me about it is if someone can use a computer to hit the brakes on a train that computer can also make the train go dangerously fast or ignore safety signals

92,for my masters in environmental science ive had to show up to weekly seminars and some of them have been genuinely interesting but one guy came in talking about self driving cars and how this would impact future parking he tried to claim his research was for environmental purposes and his data did project that we need to rely on more than natural incentives self driving cars would produce and a few bike lanes to make a real impact on co emissions but when i asked him how his future really even made a world safer for cyclists and pedestrians he had no real answer his research didnt consider noise pollution or that people with self driving cars are more likely to figure out they can just have their car go around the block a few times to get out of parking fees than send it to a cheaper parking garage a few more blocks away than usual that in the world he described it sounded like the streets would become the sole domain of driverless cars that his utopic idea of potential ride sharing with these cars seems antithetical to how the car lobby has operated for decades attempting to get more and more people to buy cars they dont need he had no real idea of how to really envision self driving car improving a day to day commuters experience just the lives of people who already owned cars and it is unfair that a person whose purview is largely data science to consider elements that likely cannot be quantified by data especially for a future which is largely theoretical already but its the fact he hadnt even seemed to have considered those issues is what aggravates me that he was unaware of other larger socio political forces behind why we live in such a car dominant society today it felt indicative that the spokes people for this future havent considered these matters either like self driving cars are in some ways better than people driven cars but the solution isnt better cars its getting rid of them

101,how am i as a pedestrian supposed to cross this road hypothetically just walk across assuming the laws that have been proposed to disallow asshole mode in self drive vehicles are a success you would be able to just walk into any traffic and all the vehicles would stop to accommodate you i forget where i saw it but some people doing a review of a self drive system tested this literally tried everything they could to get hit or cause a vehicle to choose to unsafely manoeuvre into a pedestrian or cycle and they couldnt in the limited time they had they quickly realised the tables would turn at a certain point where non motorists would dominate the roadways there would be no reason to stay off the roads it would be the safest place because the ai was working the hardest to protect you

103,this was peak dumbass when people started believing this shit was possible ok so your plan is to replace cars and service vehicles with tech that remotely doesnt exist mind you despite your highway auto features you think are even close this level and make sure they can all reliable communicate with each other and a new grid and all software companies will play fair and every car owner will keep up maintenance to for community integrity and thats just to start i have an idea for an electric vehicle that can use less space carry way more people and still get you where you want to go safer and more efficiently than this dystopia you imagine choo choo choo mother fuckers choo choo choo

105,it doesnt even take a software bug one thing wrong with the road and it all grinds to a halt one patch of black ice that causes an unexpected brake one pothole the algorithm doesnt expect one emergency vehicle coming through the intersection that the algorithm doesnt know how to schedule around one deer darting out into the road one piece of debris one tire bursting etc etc etc theres so many spanners that could get thrown into those works and all it takes is one for the entire thing to turn into a massive pileup if we were going to automate everything into a giant public transit system there are way more efficient and safe solutions than one car per commuter a comprehensive rail network with an automated last mile system for instance you ride the train to the station nearest your destination then you get on a self driving short range rickshaw kind of thing for the last mile connection provided you dont just walk there were so obsessed with future that were creating problems that we dont need to solve all so we can pretend the needlessly complicated solution is the better one because future

123,hey ive work in automation for a long time and the solution would be very simple push a button that will activate a series of software logic events to alert cars in a certain radius a human is walking across the intersection the way i would do it is all algorithms that predict the vehicle is going to intersect or potentially intersect a human will be put into a safety mode basically slows the car down a lot emphasizes the camera systems to verify path isnt blocked and overall put each vehicle in a certain vicinity on a high alert for potential human injury once the systems for the cross walk verify all humans are across and the pathway is safe it will eliminate the high alert program and fall back into its routine by the time this is a thing all cars in a square mile radius will communicate will all other vehicles they will constantly be sharing vehicle speeds locations destinations future predicted routes and all kinds of things with every car around them and an extremely strong computer quantum computer possibly will make corrections to the flow of traffic accordingly we have many years before we eliminate stop lights and order traffic rules but when it happens its going to be super cool plus robots are x more reliable than a human could ever imagine

131,heres the issue with self driving cars regular drivers are driven by people people with a sense of what theyre doing and where theyre going being able to see things that may not be on the road react accordingly and can practice self defense driving people are also extremely likely to make a mistake far more than a computer is to glitch someone might not be paying attention not get enough sleep not follow the law or simply not care a computer will never feel the need to make any mistakes and will only ever follow its programming a bug is very unlikely to occur and it doesnt even have to be fatal if it does occur problem is unless we were to replace every single vehicle on the road with self driving cars they will never be the investment many believe they are having to design a computer around the human behavior will never be effective enough to justify the cost only a full robust system designed around self driving cars will be the safest and effective system thats why it will never happen either way
132,a system like this could be safer than human drivers

134,since we have no clue how cognition ie the abilty to think and reason works in a biological brain we have no ability to create machines that have that ability either deep learning algorithms and neural network software do not and cannot have this ability regardless of how much training data you throw at it a child knows the difference between a real stop sign and a stop sign on someones clothing they also know that a stop sign is still a stop sign even if it has a sticker or some graffitti on it these so called improperly named ais do not know the difference furthermore any so called self driving car that has to randomly pull over to the side of the road and stop then call a remote human operator to guide it manually through whatever it is it cant handle is not in any way shape or form ready to be responsible for the safety of human occupants or be allowed on public roads its all a failed technology that will never be ready for real world use these companies all know this but have invested so much money in the development that they insist on marketing it anyway to recover that money or go bankrupt dont fall for the self driving car meme

136,elevated like chicago or underground warmer and safe from the elements walking areas
137,i always imagined you could keep the basic stoplight structure but guide cars into packs that move together along with more intelligent stoplights would eliminate most stopping for cars and allow pedestrians to cross and feel safe about it
138,even the most accurate gps systems can only determine what street youre on let alone what lane and they can still get it wrong for a myriad of reasons even if the cars communicate their position in a ground to ground fashion those cars appear to be crossing through less than half a car length apart even being generous and saying they are twice that distance away from colliding meters and are going at what appears to be car lengthssecond which is ms or an alarming mph they need to come to a stop in s which means they need to be able to decelerate at meters per second squared which is just beyond impossible for even the safest car with brand new tires
139,i mean if possible a simple over pass for pedestrians could work in all but the smallest of settings maybe have a lift instead of stairs so still compliant with various disibility issues this kind of solution would also allow for safer road crossings as well as it keeps cars where cars belong in general and pedestrians where pedestrians belong its safer for both parties cycling poses other design challenges in a setting like this when designed for pedestrian and motor vehicles my post also has questions dealing with weight capacity as well as would this area be offimits to big rig traffic maybe once we reach autonomous driving well have an seperate big rig lane that stays out of the way of regular vehicles and pedestrians

141,heard something that mentioned because of the auto stopping itll probably be a bigger pain in the ass to be in a car eg now if you are walking and want to cross youre not sure if the car will stop so you wait to play it safe if you know if will stop or close enough to certain to not matter the youll step out whenever you want
142,if youve ever flown youre software bug away from death also cross as normal except now you have an algorithm that reacts to your pushing the cross button at the crosswalk and pauses the merge sequence halting all traffic so you can cross safely then resumes like what the fuck i hate tech bullshittery when i see it but for ffs these are easy fixes and implements yall are worse than rthathappened
143,it would require extensive research and development but they could invent some kind of button that you can press that would notify the intersection you want to cross stopping traffic giving you safe passage maybe they could put some kind of electric sign up with a red symbol telling you to wait and a green pedestrian when its safe to cross id call it something like a cross walk
144,you are one broken brakes away from death every time you drive safety measures and regulations are needed indeed

146,game of life style synergetic self driving cars imo will probably not happen just because of how many points of failure the combined system would have and how severe the consequences are you will still have to implement forms of inefficiency for the sake of safety

150,a bridge you dumbass they can also all stop whenever the button is clicked it would be faster and safer for pedestrians this is auto driving cars that communicate thats what they are showing is possible the traffic stops and crosswalks could also communicate with the cars o

152,replace self driving cars with adequate public transportation and the solution will be cheaper and safer
153,replace self driving cars with adequate public transportation and the solution will be cheaper and safer
154,honestly self driving cars could potentially make the roads safer for pedestrians as theoretically obviously this would be different in practice a self driving car should never hit a pedestrian and would always stop or avoid them most pedestrian accidents happen because the driver was distracted or did not correctly follow traffic laws niether of which would be a problem for self deiving cars so essentially if you are a pedestrian trying to get across this road all you would need to do is walk across and pray that there isnt some bug in the self deiving system

156,there was a guy down in mexico city at the unam who tested some accident preventing tech in mini cars and it made them virtually accident proof this was more than a decade ago i am sure today it is even safer the problem is the one person who refuses to let anything else drive their car

160,keep roads and pedestrian walking areas separate overpassesunderpasses etc would be safer than current system too probably
161,keep roads and pedestrian walking areas separate overpassesunderpasses etc would be safer than current system too probably
162,you could always build a bridge or tunnel for pedestrians which is much better than a crossing anyway however as a software engineer the idea of getting in a car thats on that road is terrifying no way is that safe or could ever be safe vv for this kind of thing would be nightmarish to try and engineer even on paper let alone the real world
163,sweden has walkways that go over some of the larger roads and crossings to make walking safer for pedestrians and to create less traffic for the drivers
164,sweden has walkways that go over some of the larger roads and crossings to make walking safer for pedestrians and to create less traffic for the drivers
165,theyre called pedestrian bridges and are far safer than any crosswalk also we could pay for them with the traffic light and sign money that is saved
166,theyre called pedestrian bridges and are far safer than any crosswalk also we could pay for them with the traffic light and sign money that is saved
167,hit the button and wait for the safe to walk sign to pop up and this level of traffic wouldnt be built in areas where people normally walk
168,i mean they could just make a simple pedestrian tunnel over or under that would allow people to walk unhindered at all times regardless of traffic why not build this with say a pedestrian tunnel and a public transportation hub underneath for longer travel or shuttles to say airport or tourist destinations and a nice well lit and safe place for pedestrians i mean theoreticallyweve all seen earth to pass without noticing cars put a coffee or tea stand some folks are briish in there with a nice croissant im down
169,billionaire butthurt about wasting precious minutes at traffic lights every day and cares not a bit for anyone elses safety just say that then

171,theres no reason to make up new driving rules for automated traffic flow that would make things difficult for times where manual driving is needed or for pedestrians synchronizing traffic lights utilizing alternate routes proportionally and avoiding hazards and construction would erase the majority of traffic and congestion while also decreasing travel speed which also results in better safety for cyclists and pedestrians cars would be networked at that point along with traffic signals and things like debris on the road downed power lines potholes etc would all be able to be reported in real time to the proper departments so wed see a decrease in say power outage durations during storms automatic ride sharing options would also decrease the amount of vehicles on the roads which in turn benefits all of the above the lives saved alone will be worth it the reduction of accidents will be astronomical and ticketting police would be virtually eliminated on the roads theyd need to find new ways to generate revenue

175,i dont like cars either but pedestrian crossings have existed for a looooong time why would this junction be any different if anything if cars are ai controlled i would expect them to be even more adaptive to pedestrians and always stop when someone steps in the road etc i can see in future that pedestrian crossings might not be necessary although putting failsafes in might be tricky
176,more so your brain on silicon valley techbro culture i work in tech im so sick of naive young developers that dont understand you cant solve everything with more software or that just because they understand software doesnt mean they know shit about other domains or that you know how to evaluate externalities the entire self driving car idea is a prime example of this truly self driving vehicles that work with no fallback on unmodified roads is unlikely to be approved anytime soon for good reason the edge cases are a way harder problem than the tech sector will admit and while some safety features driven by that tech are legitimately good ideas eg auto braking too much incomplete automation risks dangerous complacency by human drivers that are already overly distracted as it is particularly since it will fail in precisely the worst case scenarios

178,damn man i have full mobility and yet dont want to go on the bridge after full day at work i dont want to drive either i just want a safe pass between work and home on my bicycle
179,if this was ever implemented in a way that pedestrians had right of way and was safe id just do laps of the intersection on foot out of spite that we have this level of technology and this was the implementation we went with
180,a software program cannot or doesnt weigh in human life in their decision there should be a difference in reaction whether a ball or child jumps in front when there is not a safe stopping distance ultimately its going to be the drivers decision at least in days pass this is why ai fighter copilots would not release munitions ultimately its a human decision to release munitions i believe today its still true a human initiates the wireless drones to release munitions
181,tesla traffic light free roads to be rolled out nationwide in months years later tesla traffic light free road debuts in las vegas on a mile stretch of road with intersections however design now features the patented tesla speedlighttrade that send a automated ai controlled spectrum devided optical signals to cars when it is safe to cross the intersection
182,the thing is that is exactly what everyone in this sub want protected bike lanes separated from traffic unfortunately much of our urban planning assumes the use of cars and nothing else no biker enjoys sharing the road with cars but they are forced to due to a lack of alternatives car brains assume that putting in bike lanes somehow infringes on their freedom to drive cars safely when bikers freedom to drive safely has been ignored the whole time putting in bike lanes helps car drivers it reduces car traffic by reducing car reliance and increases safety for everyone sounds like a win win why wouldnt you want alternative forms of transit i enjoy driving but i also enjoy biking and walking why should i be forced into this one mode car infrastructure also costs the taxpayer exponentially more than bike infrastructure

185,if i had to cross a road with this many lanes regardless of whether the cars are self driving or human driven i would take the safer overhead bridge or underpass every time
186,they also keep pedestrians safe from these cars though ill take a pedestrian overpass anyday vs banking on lanes of potentially drunk drivers stopping in time for me to cross safely
187,dress in high vis an carry around a stack of traffic cones then drop the cones all over the place and walk where you want self driving cars will have to be safe enough that they know to stop when encountering a traffic cone you can create instant gridlock
188,then you have no clue how far ai has come as long as we have humans at the wheel kids will die its beyond atrocious that you propagate that to be fair i said i trust but i should have said the data already shows that ai is safer you should research some topics before you write out things that arent true

191,to be fair i would feel way safer if this scenario happened in a completely automated traffic instead of one with human drivers
192,hm i beg to differ in this one unreliable equipment that doesnt kill en masse is fine but this is a little over the top since the payers for this system are rich and could net us more profits what i say we do is create a free system for crossing that has a death rate then let people pay for ones with lower death rates getting gradually more safe the more youre willing to pay
193,which in my experience in spite of being safer and decreasing the risk of accidents and traffic jams rarely ever happens if the rules of the road were followed to a t instead of having of drivers thinking theyre better than most drivers and being ok disobeying the rules because theyre familiarity with a car outruled their sense of dangerresponsibility instead of having selfish drivers who arbitrarily decide to get ahead of everyone else despite no inherent need for it instead of everyone creating barely an inch gap between cars or taking advantage of those with enough space by forcing yourself in there the road would be much safer and more efficient which is why trains rule

199,are you talking to yourself i literally work with ais and the whole concept is still in baby stages ais are stupid compared to humans and in no way safer literally every expert agrees that we will not have any real implementation of it during our lifetimes the only people who are pushing false information are guys like elon musk why do they do it to sell shitty produced cars and make profits off guilable people like you you sound like some young boy who thinks way too much of them and wants to have a musk like reality get real dude jesus christ you cannot be fucking serious

203,the stopping could be for a safety purpose if something happens in the middle of the intersection cars not stopping have a shorter time to react probably means they have to commit to the intersection much earlier whereas when stopping you can have more time to plan ahead and enter the intersection at a roughly equal speed with the rest for roundabouts you have to stop prior to entering the roundabout by law anyways probably for a similar reason

205,i was a little unclear up above too i think a big part of the problem is that no matter how well you coordinate cars still take up physical space and each individual car needs to be able to move into enough space to be able to operate fast speeds with safety accounting for unpredictable things that might pop up will require some amount of buffer space asking even well coordinated cars to safely move into space that they didnt anticipate being in will require a lot of independent cars to change what they were planning to do then change their plans in response to other cars changing their plans the same way one person braking at the wrong time can cause a traffic jam miles away i recognize that better coordination could reduce this problem but self driving cars will still take time to maneuver into new spaces when they have to adjust for things they couldnt anticipate

209,cyclists also ride in the middle of the road in rural areas and suburbs and hold up traffic because there are no bike lanes so they have to ride in the middle of the road because there is no other choice the problem is with poor infrastructure not people who want to use a cleaner safer and healthier form of transportation or simply just enjoy riding bikes

211,thats not the point here rolling through implies yielding yielding when its your right of way is perfectly safe and makes intersections more efficient for everyone blowing through when its not your right of way is definitely not safe and is idiotic these are completely different actions youre arguing in bad faith when you conflate the two
212,cars do have black boxes but sure red light cameras help with safety too theyre just not as effective or cost effective as speed limiters ignition interlocks and collision avoidance systems
213,cars do have black boxes but sure red light cameras help with safety too theyre just not as effective or cost effective as speed limiters ignition interlocks and collision avoidance systems
214,slow acceleration and deceleration because driving a car is dangerous get the fuck outta here if driving safely provokes road road thats on the bad drivers not the person exercising caution
215,this person literally says now i get back at drivers this implies the slowness is excessive maybe not hence the question obviously drivers need to drive safely because driving is inherently dangerous you can get off your high horse
216,i was more trying to point out the chaos on the roads in california from it i dont think letting people drive more erratically on the road is helping anyone or fostering an environment thats safe for cyclists and pedestrians but if youre going to talk about lane splitting not hurting anything hwy is the worst example its notoriously dangerous for motorcycles lol
217,i hope we make room for lightweight electric towns in the spirit of the rickshaw and simple trailer you can have arteries for trucks and emergency vehicles but of our commuting needs the steel to make driving above mph safe lower the speed and we can reduce weight and danger using several different methods
218,while they are more dangerous when burning chances of catching fire in the first place are smaller my local small town fire department just owns a container someone mixed up the gas with the brake pedal and wrapped a model s around a tree the firefighters put the burned out tesla into the container filled it with normal water deposited the container somewhere safe and let it sit there for two weeks water in the container and the earth around the tree has been contaminated and was cleaned up by specialists
219,not disregard just recognise it as at best a stepping stone and getting rid of cars is politically difficult but realistically just involves making other forms of transport more convenient set up great public transport infrastructure safe cycle lanes narrow existing roads remove parking minimums modify roads to force lower speeds make dedicated bus lanes etc if it takes an hour to get where youre going by car but half an hour by subway the choice is fairly obvious
220,yes the car is a specific technology with specific uses currently we use it for far more than it is useful for and the consequences are very detrimental to society not to mention the environment as per your example in communities where people cycle more the elderly have greater mobility later on in life because they lead more active lifestyles and because they are able to ride a bike safely in old age and not endanger others as with an automobile of course for those who are not able to walk or ride there are other options but these modes can function better because roads are occupied only with those functions that are deemed most necessary optimal for that specific mode and not clogged up
221,ai managed traffic and regenerative braking or we could just have trains also what youre describing isnt even ai its just computer control which is how most metros work also has been experimented with cars ai specifically is using a machine learning model to drive a car which could incorporate car to car communication and smart traffic management like youre describing or we could just have trains which are still much much much much much more efficient and safer and faster

225,nuclear reactors reddit says theyre safe and environmentally friendly so who am i to question that
226,i dont think youre really aware of how cbtc actually works or how efficient trains are also its a lot better to just run as many as possible than to do some weird tech bro efficiency bullshit with it like rail examining the number of people waiting why having people state where theyre going this is horrible ux also why also train tickets turnstyles dynamically allocating trains to provide additional transit as necessary this already happens automatically slowing down certain trains by a couple minutes in order to alleviate congestion in stations what what congestion if theres congestion youd want more trains to move people this screws over people already on the train this makes them unreliable it is better for humans if there are consistent schedules without unexpected delays or speed ups like thats part of what makes taking the bus so horrible you dont know when its going to show up it gets stuck in traffic sometimes they skip your stop because the bus is full or the driver wants to and why would you need regenerative braking in trains do you know how trains work they speed up to the safest maximum speed then cut the power to slow down barely using brakes to come to a complete stop at the station if you ride a subway in a dense area like manhattan youll feel them pedal to the metal about halfway from station to station then they cut the power skilled operators can glide in in fact using the brakes on trains sucks horribly it fucks up your balance can make stuff knock over etc theres literally a japanese metro sim all about getting it as perfect as possible

235,which is ironic because the idea of a larger vehicle being safer for its occupants is largely a myth mostly its just that they are more dangerous to people other than their occupants in the american hyper competitive commercial propaganda riddled mindset these two things apparently equate become safer by being more dangerous to everyone else of course

237,i pay ish a month for insurance and ish a month for a car payment the car is literally known as one of the cheapest pieces of plastic shit south korea can legally put on a highway chevy spark i have had full on fantasies about destroying that thing and paying it off with the insurance money i wish i had never set eyes on the damn thing i only use it for grocery shopping and i have to remember to turn it on every week so the just installed rare small size out of stock everywhere had to get a refurbished instead battery doesnt die i hate exercise but this car alone motivated me to get a bike when i move the neighborhood i live in is too unsafe to be outside in
238,electric motorcycles like niu are great and should be the main form of ev with e bikes coming second replacing at least the majority of all cars convenience stores should have batteries available for swapping eliminating the need for fast charging enabling longer trips and increasing the lifetime of each battery gas powered motorcycles are too polluting but they do reduce congestion at least safety is an issue with motorcycles a lot of that is helped significantly by removing cars

242,public transport sucks because its not well funded a pretty common play for cities is to defund andor barely fund public transit then point at low ridership numbers as a reason to keep defunding it my city used to have actually pretty decent transit then its budget was slashed when people no longer needed to go downtown due to wfh now its at a downwards spiral where nothings on time and nobody really feels safe riding it anymore leading to even less riders and less funding which is a damn shame im part of that problem and bought a car when my minute commute became an hour commute for a minute drive
243,ive seen plenty of people here that like motorsports including me and one thing we all have in common is that we agree that driving on public roads with other people is absolute garbage whats the point of having a fast car if you wont take it to the track where it can be properly and safely used
244,that doesnt solve any problem no car is really safe and electric cars still produce at least of the co of a fossil car over their lifetime and all the other problems arent even touched mostly regarding car centric infrastructure and all the negative consequences that come from it
245,driving can be a fun activity but your hobby should not be enforced on everyone else to partake in especially when it causes many problems instead driving for sport or fun should take place in a controlled safe environment like a racetrack with people who enjoy the sport all around you im also not sure how you can like being stuck in traffic most days and find that fun maybe you arent usually stuck in traffic but for the majority of people driving in most places in the world that is the reality and it is not fun your experience of public transit was poor and that is one thing this subreddit is against we advocate for safer reliable frequent and fast public transit so that your commute of minutes could get down to or maybe even less in many places around the world public transit is the fastes option you also complain about the cleanliness of public transit and that could also be fixed you just need to help by advocating for more funding towards your local public transit system

247,it sounds like your country is already using steps into making cars as a form of travel not mandatory this is good here this is exactly the change we advocate for so in not sure why that makes you against this many things are culture and no one is saying to get rid of cars completely many on this sub are car enthusiasts but dislike the problems from car oriented citiessuburbs in only the most rural places is public transit not an option but that doesnt mean roads cant be designed in a safer way for all users in those places maybe roundabouts on high speed roads and on slower rural roads there could be traffic calming measures like narrower lanes or trees pokedex closer to the road however the places where change well be the most impactful are urban and suburban areas and that is why you will see an urbansuburban focus on this subreddit have a good day as well

249,this sub is literally on your side reducing car dependency makes streets safer at night more people walking more money to spend of policing and lighting of areas the quality of public transport will rise too be given priority and take maybe a few minutes longer than driving with no traffic but it will be cheaper run often and allow you to sit down relax and watch youtube while you get driven home in a clean modern bus

251,its generally true that the risk is not actually very large here in the uk analysis shows that the health benefits accrued from cycling outweigh the risks of injury or death from collisions with motor traffic by a large margin but it still feels unsafe and even if that isnt really the case it puts people off
252,i always see people compare stats of other things to cars and then theyre like if youre worried about x then youd never get in a car either but now im like yeah maybe we shouldnt or thats not saying much at least in other developed countries they are making it safer over time but the improvements have stopped in the us and it seems like most people just accept a certain amount of death as business as usual

258,were on the same side at least for now if we get what we want transit and walkability you automatically get less congested roads further out to enjoy your car on the car in fuckcars is the car of the general zeitgeist and the car manufacturers want to sell you an unrepairable computerised tall wide monster that gets mpg doesnt fit in a parking space and isnt even useful as a commercial vehicle its main function is to pad someones vanity or soothe their fear about someone in an even bigger car hitting them and the net result is you need one to do things that take longer than they would if you just walked and hadnt designed the city around them in the first place cars as a hobby still pollute and some are too loud but have none of the other problems the name is intentionally incendary and this was more of a safe space for people to bitch without having to explain the nuance it does serve a purpose though in that it draws a lot of attention which is valuable for getting people like you to think and engage where otherwise you may never have noticed just as you likely never really noticed the urban planning walkable cities transit and similar focused communities
259,youre always safer if you happen to collide with a small car rather than a large one anyway yes that was a bit of a twisting of your words i know thats not what you meant its the truth though those who think that driving big is driving safe or that lightweight fuel efficient vehicles are inherently more dangerous than their heavyweight counterparts need to think again a researcher with lawrence berkeley national lab berkeley lab has teamed with a researcher from the university of michigan in a unique risk analysis study which shows that contrary to conventional wisdom vehicle quality is a much more important safety factor than weight for the drivers of vehicles involved in a crash most cars are safer than the average sports utility vehicle suv while pickup trucks are much less safe than all other types minivans and import luxury cars have the safest records states the report an analysis of traffic deaths by vehicle type and model which was prepared by tom wenzel an energy analyst with berkeley labs environmental energy technologies division and marc ross a professor in michigans applied physics department a shortcoming of many safety analyses has been that only risks to drivers of a given kind of vehicle are evaluated while the risks imposed on others are ignored says wenzel we focused on the risk not only to occupants of the vehicle model in question in all types of crashes but also on the risk to the drivers of other vehicles involved in crashes with the model in question wenzel and ross determined that suvs are no safer for their drivers than the average midsize or large car and not much safer than many of the most popular compact and subcompact car models drivers of pickup trucks are at even greater risk than drivers of suvs when the combined risk is considered suvs and pickup trucks are revealed to be significantly more dangerous than just about any car all the evidence in our study shows that vehicles can be and in fact are being made lighter and more fuel efficient without sacrificing safety says wenzel the argument that lowering the weight of cars to achieve high fuel economy has resulted in excess deaths is unfounded is bigger safer it aint necessarily so articlesarchiveeetd suv safetyhtml berkeley lab in other words when considering size alone it is the size of the vehicle you collide with that is most important not the size of your own by driving a big vehicle all you are really doing is increasing the amount of kinetic energy involved in collisions which is bad however this fact doesnt tend to sell cars and make profit as well as the bigger cars are safer mantra of the advertising industry

263,the transit in your city seems exceptionally bad because having to call the police on transit is not normal fights drunks dirtiness and general unsafety are not inherent features of public transit and if they are in your city then your city council has some work to do

265,the more people use it the safer it becomes funding public transit and bicycle friendly infrastructure helps a lot with social surveillance when theres a lot more general working folk using the bus to commute it is a lot less likely for dodgy people to get on and even if they do its not as scary annoying when youre surrounded by your peers

268,the public transport you have now might double your commute at least in the us we dont even try to have good public transport its a national embarrassment for the richest country in the world anyway benefits you can do stuff on your commute sleep browse reddit eat breakfast fix your hair probably more walking and time spent outdoors its good for your health and good for your mood its safer cars are a leading cause of death and injury

270,most people huh is that why walkable and transit friendly cities like seattle san francisco and new york are quite literally the most expensive cities in the us because no one wants to live there not to mention that of people in the largest metro areas say they wish bike infrastructure was better so they felt safer biking and could bike more apinationalgeographiccomdistributionpublicampenvironmentarticleis the us becoming more bike friendly no one is telling you what to do with your town but in cities people want more walkable bikeable and transit friendly infrastructure feel free to do whatever you want in your rural town but seeing as you dont pay taxes to my city i dont see how your opinion is relevant

272,worst argument ever its pretty hard to kill someone with a bike or by walking even if there is human error even trains are safer humans will never be efficient and that is why cars are more dangerous
273,worst argument ever its pretty hard to kill someone with a bike or by walking even if there is human error even trains are safer humans will never be efficient and that is why cars are more dangerous
274,and the road rage some of it justified eg people driving unsafely and putting your and other peoples lives in even more needless danger and a lot of it not eg working class people pitted against each other in a competition of cutting each other off to get to work seconds earlier in the hope that they dont get fired by the capitalist slave master
275,youd be surprised they have such a wide rpm band that with a little gearing adjustment you can get up to highway speeds takes a while to get there but they can nonetheless super dangerous though a s the brakes arent meant for that kind of speed im more pro electric motorcycles cause the e bikes brakes arent really safe above mph i know a guy who took an old motorcycle and put an electric motor on there that way he had brakes safe for high speeds the people who just slap a electric motor on a e bike are fine as long as they dont push past then its dangerous
276,having to call at all on transit is too much i dont want to use a system that i feel unsafe on the sheer amount of times someone has come on the bus covered in shit and blabbering incoherently or started threatening people makes me want to never use it
277,ugh so true i had to pretty much give it up after fender benders in one day came to the conclusion that my condition makes me dangerous on the road ive since moved to nyc and am no longer a threat to public safety lol

281,and what cars dont make u feel unsafe i take it youve never been in an accident before
282,youre close to getting the idea behind this sub its not about asking people to bike or walk where they usually drive its asking people if they could live somewhere where they could easily walkbike for all their needs quickly and safely would they be open to that the infrastructure is everything
283,idk where you are from but the us gives a k tax credit if you buy any street legal electric vehicle as long as it you can legally register it and it passes safety inspections it would get you the k tax credit

293,this will kill regional flight carriers if you look at door to door time the rest are safe theyve got a year warning
294,no duh why be a car at all self driving living room ie a self driving camper now thing would need changing safety engineering to allow mobility while in motion mostly bathroom to lounge chair

299,what about safety it will be interesting to see how well self driving cars can compete with airlines in this respect air travel is currently much safer than car travel and i doubt self driving cars will be hugely better than conventional cars cars have the advantage that accidents kill way fewer people per incident than aircraft and that could help perceptions but self driving cars share with aircraft the feeling of not being in control which people dislike

308,the questions presume we have self driving cars those autonomous cars are as safe to ride as human driven cars we are very far from having those two things xb the questions asked people to consider the frustration of getting to the air port parking their car getting through screening finding luggage at the end of the trip and renting a car at the destination versus riding an autonomous car the full trip they were not asked to consider the safety of air travel versus ground travel xb something else which was not considered was a round trip travel time of three days versus hours when the individual has a total of vacation days xb ifwhen we ever have these autonomous vehicles the usage will likely vary greatly from such thought surveys

310,lol maybe this will be a possibility when self driving cars can reach the speeds that commercial airliners can reach and the driver wont have to bother with refueling and can just sleep throughout the whole trip but as it stands people take domestic flights mostly because its faster and much safer than driving

312,another point to consider will flying still be safer than a hour drive might it be worth flying across country and having your car drive itself there to pick you up at the airport if the empty car totals itself on the way because of a drunk redneck crossed lanes with his truck then at least you werent in it and can just rent a car at the airport instead of your family arranging your funeral and wondering wether elon musk or the redneck was to blame

314,there are more reasons than given in the article youre not trapped in a can with people who will probably get you sick no crying kids you can stop at restaurants along the way theres no chance you will get bumped theres no chance your trip will be cancelled you travel when you want and can make the decision at the last minute without it costing more downsides longer for anything longer than a few hour flight as noted in the article until open container laws are updated you can drink on the flight but not in the car even in a self driving car air travel is still radically safer

316,good they need some competition in the area of comfort but realistically speaking im not sure someone would trade a couple hours in the sky and a couple hours waiting for the flight for a hour drive time taken can be its own form of discomfort that can be worse than cramped seating in the far future when cars can safely drive at miles per hour thanks to road sensors ahead and full automation roadways with point to point self driving cars then wed start to see it impact but right now you really cant be in those vehicles for entire trips and sleeping or something
317,this is awesome environmentally because we are soooooo far from building planes that dont run on fossil fuels flying is one of the biggest carbon producing activities the average rich country person does amazing if we can move away from that as a global society i know were a long way off from complete adoption of avs but once theyre the only ones on the road theyll be able to safely go much faster than we currently drive closing that timing gap with air travel combine that with proliferation of hyperloop type underground highways and car travel is looking much nicer than planes
318,eh i dont know about that the privacy of a driverless car sounds nice but safety is still an issue also given the example choice of a hour flight vs a hour driverless ride i dont think most people would choose the option that takes five times longer however i do think their prediction about splitting trips taking a driverless car to a distant airport for cheaper air travel might actually come true if the ideal future of safe private and affordable driverless cars comes to pass

326,sure being able to sleepworkplay in the car would be great but a true autopilot level in the industrys terms i think wouldnt replace the large share of travelers who are trying to get somewhere quickly a car wouldnt work for me to travel cross country for a long weekend for instance as for having beds keep in mind that safety requirements are still going to limit the practical size and shape of cars along with other safety features you might still be required to buckle up for instance

328,truly safe driverless cars will disrupt the airline industry the hotel industry and the transportation industry if i have an interview business trip why fly there spend the night in a hotel and rent a car take a taxi or uber to the destination when i can leave much later and sleep in a self driving van that has great leg room and will allow more than fl oz
329,and remeber with no human drivers the cars can drive a lot faster safely
330,not to mention if all cars become required to have the auto pilot when it is safer than human interaction with the vehicle which some believe we are very close the speed limit could be much higher designs of cars will change to be more drag coefficient regular speeds could be substantially higher to us alive today we would think its insane to our grandkids theyll think its completely normal

332,and we could move at higher speeds more safely as cars can be programmed to properly merge into traffic without disrupting traffic flow the most dangerous part of the car right now is he pink squishy thing behind the wheel
333,if you live in a city with actual infrastructure it hardly min to the airport h check in and then min from the airport to destination a h flight becomes h which is still times faster not to mention safer cheaper and you get the extra time in your destination

335,except unless every car on the road is also autonomous it would be extremely unsafe to sleep in the prone position in any vehicle
336,and what if theoretically of course they ran on a single dedicated lane or track to avoid traffic jams and ensure the safety of all passengers that would be a cool invention
337,and what if theoretically of course they ran on a single dedicated lane or track to avoid traffic jams and ensure the safety of all passengers that would be a cool invention
338,well only us citizens and travelers from a handful of safe countries are eligible for the program so yes its effective by default
339,i work with autonomous cars they are incredibly smart and have great perception these cars arent something that can be just done as a startup you have to have the best technology both in software and hardware the point of all of this is make it safe remove the human error these cars dont fall asleep get drunk or become reckless you need the money and time to invest in these cars and the technology its peoples lives at risk so its dangerous to try to join the bandwagon and throw cars out on the road edit phrasing
340,self driving cars as a concept are great but not everyone is capable of the engineering required to make a safe autonomous vehicle i would trust google x or tesla to make a good self driving car because they have the experience and talent in systems electrical software and mechanical engineering to pull of such a complicated project but uber is not on their level uber is not really a technology company theyre an appservice provider the uber app could be made by any year old app developer its not complicated so why is uber in the same conversation as companies that have been at the cutting edge of ai for the past decades
341,the reality is that self driving automobiles are already safer than humans self driving automobiles dont fall sleep dont get distracted dont forget the rules of the road and dont make mistakesany mistake is a correctable programming error they also have constant degree awareness and the ability to communicate with other self driving automobiles given time they will also be able to properly diagnose problems with the automobile itself and schedule needed maintenance the overwhelming majority of accidents occur because one or more parties either werent paying attention or didnt follow the rules of the road and this is not a problem with self driving automobiles

343,i think that even if self driving cars are never safe from situations like the uber accident a societal shift will happen when self driving are commonplace for people to have more respect for the road no one blames a train for killing someone if they are on the train line wherewhen they werent meant to be and most of us pay plenty of attention when we are near one i think self driving cars may end up being seen in a similar light
344,k deaths in the us every year even if they kill people a year it would still be better than humans stopping drunk driving speeders aggressive drivers and illegal turns and such would resolve a lot of those deaths taking the ability to perform them and placing them into a computer robots hands would stop them for sure being able to hive mind all the cars so they start and stop instantly as needed with each other at lights or not needing lights at all would really improve traffic and safety

346,i cant wait for the golden age where bad uncomfortable drivers are in self driving cars and i can blow by them in my manual gas guzzling s sports car in a safe manner rx
347,a self driving car will never exceed the speed limit enjoy that a self driving car will never drink and drive a self driving car will not fall asleep at the wheel a self driving car will not run a red light try to beat a train make unsafe lane changes or operate with faulty brakes and steering a self driving car will have more air bag and rollover protection for the occupants than did the gemini capsules on the day that ubers self driving test car killed a woman people were killed by cars driven by other people in sum a self driving car is infinitely safer than a human driven car how on earth could this be a bad thing

349,as an it guy working for the us air force im very concerned about how accessible the computer technology in self driving cars will be one bad update can completely wreck a network i am seriously concerned that self driving cars will present terrorists who can hack with a highly accessible weapon of mass destruction if im ignorant of how these cars are being programmed to prevent intrusion please inform me until i can see proof that im wrong i will continue to believe there is no such thing as safe software
350,hes absolutely right this technology will be paid for with blood like most groundbreaking changes its sad but the only thing we can do is limit the damage along the way in the end the promise of safer roads and cheaper transportation are realistic in a few decades

352,yeah in general self driving cars will lead to fewer accidents and safer travel for the general population but people dont see at as an or situation which is to say they ignore that people die due to unsafe driving at an astounding rate throughout the world but they cant or dont compare it to the lower rate present in self driving cars

354,i think its more about not being in control thats what bothers me about flying also something about placing your life in the hands of others or ai just doesnt sit well with meeven if it is technically safer
355,i think its more about not being in control thats what bothers me about flying also something about placing your life in the hands of others or ai just doesnt sit well with meeven if it is technically safer
356,no matter how safe or logical something is it will be ruined by sensationalist assholes and the dumbasses that believe them without a second thought i await they day we have autonomous cars that are infallible yet they are illegal because people are dumb and scared of change
357,the future is coming and its not going to stop self driving cars and swarming behavior where cars communicate with each other and move together like a school of fish are going to change our motoring life as soon as self driving cars reduce accidents and save lives it will start with owners getting steep insurance and tax discounts eventually people who drive themselves will be targeted for the risk of accidents and penalized with insurance and taxes and eventually it will likely become illegal to operate a motor vehicle by hand in many areas it comes down to safety all of our traffic laws car insurance tickets fines are all there to promote safe driving but when the car can drive itself more safely than you can its a no brainer like it or not its going to force you out of the drivers seat its not so bad though you will be the first generation of people to maintain your independence even long after you are too old to safely drive anymore you will get hours of time back with which to do other things while commuting to work catch up on reading get some work done play some mobile games browse the net etc finally it will also empower metro ride sharing and better traffic management in urban areas buses and mass transportation are efficient but mainly done in order to cut down traffic however when traffic manages itself its going to be possible to commute in smaller highways at higher speed without traffic jams and a swarm of self driving cars can be as efficient as multiple people taking the bus it would only make sense for cities to augment their public transportation with ride sharing where fleets of public cars are spread throughout the city and will take you wherever you want to go many city dwellers already find it difficult to own and operate a car this would be the next step

359,id rather trust a robot driving that is programmed to be safe than deal with the average driver from nj or nyc i see people so the dumbest shit and its fine autonomous cars with a manual override if needed be a thing
360,i mean who would buy a self driving car that isnt safe for them seems like bad business in the first place
361,thats a pretty convient thing to say when you want to sell these vehicles it is way to early to star talking about acceptable levels of death from autonomous vehicles if they are really so good as to safe lives than make them so good that accidental deaths due to the fault of the car is extremely rare
362,and a proper prt system like skytran that travels meters up in the air could save millions no thats it thats the whole sentence i suppose there might be some outlandish accident where a person slips and falls and hits their head or something but a system like that would eliminate the possibility of traffic accidents and be cleaner faster cheaper safer and at least as convenient as cars

364,id happily give the responsibility of driving to an self driving car if that means everyone else does the same i know it can be counter intuitive to a lot of people but this will indeed save so many lives people used to not trust elevators when they first were invented they literally had to make sure an operator was inside the lift to press the buttons in order to create a sense of safety

368,yeah but you cant make something as inherently dangerous as being in a car on the road completely safe without making it so insanely expensive and impractical that it defeats the purpose and youll never eliminate all possible risk theres always freak occurrences and far too many variables anyway we already accept far greater risk when we get into a thinly plated metal cage weighing half a tonne or more traveling at kmhr on a narrow road in the opposite direction to other complete strangers doing the same thing with only human reflexes and just hope they arent drunk or mildly distracted and dont turn the wheel slightly and kill you both its interesting that we worry about other people having guns but well happily get on the road or cross a street and trust people not to point their weapons at at us and press the controlled explosion powered go button
369,i wonder though is there no solution that can make it so that the self driving cars can be safe and not have any chance of killing anyone or rather what situation could cause a self driving car to kill someone would it be from an electrical malfunction or maybe something like a virus d i dont really know how it works
370,autonomous driving adoption rate will be driven by insurance companies autonomous cars will be way safer therefore less claims and insurance companies will reward the owners of those cars while pushing the premiums up of every non autonomous car driver until it doesnt make sense to own a car that isnt autonomous

372,the example i like to give is to ask would seem acceptable if i could wave a magic wand and make all the cars self driving tomorrow but with the knowledge that on average people every day will die due to failures in the technology person in every state every day dies that sounds like an absurdly high number of deaths until you find out that human drivers kill twice that many every day its almost inconceivable to me that self driving cars could possibly not be significantly safer for everyone once the technology has been properly developed

374,i seem to be alone in thinking there is a difference between we are making the world safer and its okay to release the software early and kill a few people because in the long run it will save lives uber is rushing out self driving cars so they can not pay drivers and increase profits volvo meanwhile had developed a system also for profit that would detect obstructions and stop the vehicle before a human could even start to respond it would have avoided killing the woman possibly stopping completely in tempe and it was in the volvo xc uber was using as a test vehicle uber disabled the system to beta test their own this is the problem given the low quality dashcam footage released there was about seconds from first observing the pedestrian to impact and at mph thats about feet the volvo xc can stop from mph in feet car volvo xc and from in feet http

376,i know that autonomous cars are safer i have been following the studies and growth of the technology for years just as a curious hobbyist not an expert but there will come a time when a person or group of people is killed by an autonomous car and it will be all over the news and there will be a lot of people in the camp of i just dont trust them robot cars the data will not matter because even though autonomous cars are safer than human drivers there will be people who will wish for the system of human choice over the cold unfeeling determinism of machines

380,i feel like the manufacturers should all come together to create a company with the top minds from all groups which would be responsible for automation i think if one company created the base automation for all it would be safer than all automakers hacking and slashing their way to a good enough product it also would stop the inevitable manufacturing monopolies if any company could start up and create a new type of vehicle and just apply existing tested automation to it

382,when all cars are self driving it will be a lot safer too because the machine driving patterns are more predictable than human behaviors the machines dont look at phones while driving they dont turn their head at their baby on the back seat they dont nod off or get drunk and they dont cross roads not looking to their left and right they dont assume the other car would brake for them

384,i personally want to see most cars on the road driving themselves i get incredibly anxious even just riding in a car and have never had a license because of it self driving cars will have accidents but far fewer than we have with human error there wont be the issue of overly aggressive drivers and these self driving cars wont pull of crazy unsafe maneuvers to save themselves a second or two of time on the road ill feel much safer if the human element is taken off the roads in favor of much less fallible ai drivers

386,theyll save more than that we need them to agree on protocols so they can communicate with one another and route traffic efficiently as well the sooner we get these on the road and get people out of the drivers seat well all be much safer

392,toyota executive saying to trust how his cars are safe not biased and selfless certainly not interested by bigger sales and only aiming to make the world a better place s
393,nope sorry not gonna have an ai drive me around and cause a fatal accident i could have prevented and i need my control when i have to dodge other equally safe self driving cars that are on the road ever consider how easy it is for your death to be blamed on a system malfunction on a fast speed highway aaaand yah im never giving up being able to control my vehicle thanks tho xd
394,self driving cars are absurd and will never be safe or popular its hard enough to get people to accept electric cars let alone driverless ones
395,some guy on facebook last night said these cars werent safe i pointed out how many people die currently and asked if these self driving cars would be considered safe if they beat that number he said he didnt want to talk stats and just reiterated that auto pilot cars will never be safe boats and planes hes cool with people are idiots
396,can we please be clear here the fatalities that will occur during mature ai vehicle automation will largely if not almost completely be the fault of humans anyways take the recent woman who got hit she was walking across the street where there was no crosswalk slowly in the middle of the night with zero reflective clothing the local police have already cleared the driverthere was a person in the vehicle and the vehicle being at fault yet that will go down as a vehicle automation casualties just think of this though for a second how many year olds are out there driving all over the place going on the freeway and yet if you threw them a tennis ball they wouldnt be coordinated enough to catch it out of the air there are hundreds of thousands of people driving around like that now add the inexperienced drivers destined to make mistakes now add the distracted drivers drinking coffee doing makeup checking phone finally throw in a bunch of drunk drivers who otherwise would safely be passed out as their car drove them home anyone who wants to look at this rationally has no choice but to realize it is the clear better alternative its sorta sad to think that there will be people out there who advocate against autonomous vehicles and they will tragically have one of their family members die to a drunk driver or some other human caused mistake right now they are out there and dont even know it just removing drunk drivers alone would be unimaginable in terms of saving lives yet these fucking idiots will fight it and delay it as long as they can
397,the whole uber situation in arizona is fucked due to backdoor deals with doug douchey ill admit that much one person dying to an automated uber in two years of testing is an acceptable risk to me look at the pedestrian crash statistics for arizona hell look at the mill ave statistics alone and people are here whining about a single accident in which a pedestrian jay walked on a dark road in two whole years time prior accident doesnt count the car performed an illegal maneuver and hit an uber overturning it in alone the were pedestrian related accidents of which pedestrians were killed where is the outage for these of the remaining sizeable amount required immediate medical attention lets assume followed suit with another the uber accident is of all fatal accidents involving pedestrians in arizona and the outage its generated is ridiculous improvements need to made automation is the answer to traffic congestion general safety of pedestrians and passengers

399,the great thing about self driving cars it will force pedestrians to be more aware of their surroundings hopefully if the cars priority is to protect the passenger pedestrians will again hopefully be inclined to think a little more about their own safety and not do silly things on the road

401,yes ridiculous when people argue that it is not safe when a wreck happens with an autonomous car it is all over the news meanwhile humans wreck thousands of times every day
402,so far they mostly killed and they are not safer than regular cars given the few numbers of them and some other factors
403,so far they mostly killed and they are not safer than regular cars given the few numbers of them and some other factors
404,it isnt necessarily logical to just look at the raw numbers you have to look at fairness too lets say a human operated car kills people per x miles and of those people are the driverpassenger of the vehicles involved in the accident and the other are pedestrians now lets say a self driving car only kills people per x miles but of those people are driverpassengers of the vehicles and are pedestrians in this made up scenario youve drastically reduced the rate of vehicle users who die from driving but youve doubled the rate of pedestrian deaths is it fair to swap the safety of a driver who makes a choice to get in a vehicle for the safety of a pedestrian who never made that choice

406,i think they have to stop trying to sell selfdriving cars on safety when we switched from horses to cars we did it for convenience despite the massive increase of deaths just stop trying to make it the biggest selling point itll just make people lose confidence every time theres an accident

408,perhaps knowing that there is a potential risk and nobody to blame but a machine pedestrians will get off their phones and be aware of their surroundings as they walk around this may skew the data when it comes to accidents though kind of a placebo effect making the self driving vehicles appear to be even safer than they arefor a while anywaywishful thinking

410,my only argument is that if testing needs to be done they can do it on private testing tracks and should have these test have the developers act as the test subjects to walk in front of these cars to recreate the tempe incident i dont believe testing these cars over the next to years when no one is liable for fatalities and uber can simply pay off the family justifies the greater good of public safety anyone that can justify this based on statistics is cold soul of a person the outcome will be that people die at a lower rate while millions will also lose their jobs to ai and also die a slow death

412,to everyone in this comment string trying to make the point that flying a plane is easier for automated control youre right it is easier and yetwe still require pilots why would you expect to have manual oversight of self driving cars go away any time in the near future thats at least a decade or two and probably more after we have a system capable of doing so safely with human oversight its the same thing that happened when elevators went automatic the automatic push button elevator was invented in but it took years to get rid of the operators when driverless elevators drew skepticism
413,its peoples lives at risk so its dangerous to try to join the bandwagon and throw cars out on the road exactly and the fear is that states like arizona are inviting companies like uber to employ autonomous cars while cutting corners on safety http fortunecomuber self driving program troubles like eliminating secondary sensors and then justifying it by saying more lives are undoubtedly saved than lost the argument that some deaths are an acceptable price to pay in exchange for theoretical lives saved is merely a defense of these tactics no cars should be greenlit in the assumption that it may kill some people just because it may not kill as many as human drivers would

415,laxer than uber will be responsible for maintaining and deploying sdv fleets in the poorer regions of america i dont trust them to be as safe as waymo or competent drivers
416,the assumption is the incidents between self driving cars are less numerous than human error because there are fewer variables self driving cars remove the human factor which is why even in your worse case scenario its still more likely to be safer than human drivers

418,self driving car is as safe as a train theoretically
419,they would stop or safely swerve to avoid
420,the statistics actually show that human involvement is due to other human error if you look at all crash statistics for self driving cars they are the ones being hit like of the time they are much safer than human drivers in the most heavily travelled areas

424,except car does not set out to kill some people to sacrifice for others it will try to drive safely all the time its more like save thousands fail one
425,the trolly problem is largely imagined i think people thought automating elevators would create this huge ethical dilemma but the reality is the cars wont go faster than is safe and the minute something is mechanically wrong theyll just pull off to the side and stop the majority of accidents that are like turn away from accidents and not oh crap stop accidents are just because the driver wasnt paying attention and didnt realize it was an oh crap stop accident until it was too late computers will just be able to stop the car before its a plow into the kid or the car problem
426,all of life is about trade offs there are very few total solutions to any problem that improve every metric we could make life orders of magnitude safer from cars even now if we were just willing to spend far more than we do

428,all it has to do is protect the occupants in the car i pay for the car and i should be able to rely on it to keep me and my family safe above anything else
429,as sad as it is the autonomous cars main responsibility is the safety of its passengers it will make whatever decision it deems to be safest for the occupants in the car thats the only way to solve this problem unfortunately

431,almost every safety innovation results in a few deaths that wouldnt have happened otherwise airbags have killed people and people drown when they are unable to release their seat belts

433,agree with this their are huge legal and ethical barriers to removing a human operator who is responsible for the car another thing to add to your list is how autonomous cars will balance the safety of other road users pedestrians and its occupants simply comparing bulk numbers of people injured and killed wont work is it ethical to sell a car that would potentially endanger you by swerving away from a group people in the road should the car being more willing to swerve away from pedestrians in a potentially dangerous maneuver if you are the sole occupant

435,this exactly there was a recent cyclist killed by a tesla a lot of people saw that and went see self driving cars are not safe but the problem isnt wether or not theyre safe its wether or not we can trust the manufacturer to take responsibility or even be honest when the accident was caused by a lapse in the autonomous system
436,considering that these statistics are just a contrived thought experiment and dont accurately represent the actual safety deferential the answer to this question is irrelevant self driving cars are safer for pedestrians too

439,uber has deaths per million miles death over million miles though thats one statistic but uber has a pretty bad record compared to waymo self driving arizona crash report if we base the safety record on waymo which has m miles and no deaths things look much safer

442,ok that sentence is a bit confusing all im saying is self driving cars arent going to be a thing for the average person not for a long long time if ever they will be gimmicks for rich people to drive around pre programmed ultra safe routes no one is going to have a self driving car to take them to work and the store or a cross country trip the reality of our crumbling road infrastructure legislation and realities of ai and sensor capabilities will prove me correct were not actually making any advances along those fronts in any meaningful capacity machine learning isnt magic like everyone on rfuturology seems to think it is eventually the companies themselves will stop throwing money at this stuff for little return plenty of technology has gone in that direction
443,yeah theres nothing wrong with making more money because people want your car because its safer
444,yeah theres nothing wrong with making more money because people want your car because its safer
445,actually because of the technology built into these cars they could be controlled by a central traffic authority everything about them could be controlled including speed when and were they could be driven and how often there could even be a licensing system set up for how often people want to use the cars want access thats a really high license fee limited use like back and forth to work would cost less however spontaneous shopping trips would be limited all of this could be justified in terms of keep traffic flowing at a steady but safe pace fuel economy environmental concerns safety and other social concerns the era of jumping in your car and going where you want and when you want will be over i dont say i like it but the temptation to eliminate all the bad things associated with cars controlled by individuals will too great for those in charge to resist my advice keep a big block chevelle hidden in your garage

447,there needs to be a industry wide algorithm so all the ai is the same in those situations i personally think that the ai should prioritize driver safety over all other concerns and then follow a rigorously debated line of decisions on the ethics of the decisions beyond that
448,there needs to be a industry wide algorithm so all the ai is the same in those situations i personally think that the ai should prioritize driver safety over all other concerns and then follow a rigorously debated line of decisions on the ethics of the decisions beyond that
449,in many situations safe drive requires violating the traffic code like when you have to cross a double line to get around a parked truck or when you have to exceed the speed limit to safely pass other drivers will constantly break the law too and the cars ai will have to know how to anticipate and navigate that like when you see an asshole speeding driver coming up behind you so you get out of the way to let them pass if the car decides to stick to its lane and speed without regard to the assholes behavior it could create a hazard the car should be required to be reasonably safe just following traffic laws is too low a bar
450,the car will do everything it can to save the driver keep summer safe
451,are you high there are literally laws for pedestrians requiring a certain conduct no matter how careful a driver is theres not much they can do if some dumbshit pedestrian runs into traffic or walks out into the road at night like with that auto car incident even in crosswalks for all the talk about bad drivers pedestrians and also especially cyclists act as complete idiots with no regard for their own safety atleast as much

453,i understand and am responding to what you wrote a human must take active responsibility because of a dangerous situation once every which means with no human interaction there would beon the extremely limited dataset of the technology of today which is also getting better with every mile drivenone accident however ive years of drivingwith federal government trainingand i have to take constant action to avoid accidents in situations created by other drivers and other drivers are not getting better they are getting more numerous therefore if a human only has to take correction once every miles that means there is less opportunity for humans to screw it up when called upon to do the right thing now imagine a world in the near future where there is a greater percentage of automated cars which reduces the ratio of better drivers there will be less accidents and less incidents for with the cars will have to respond ergo a safer experience your figures support that conclusion

457,im writing a thesis on this for class using this exact same argument there has been an ethics panel in germany that has made a very similar conclusion valuing human life must take precedence above all else the question is where do we draw the line is it quantitative if there are two pedestrians is it fair to kill just one passenger instead its the trolley car debate on steroids another problem is that research so far indicates that the overwhelming majority of the public wants these cars they just dont want to pay the price with their own lives when someone else could take the fall its a catch that will take government intervention to solve because the automotive industry simply catering to consumer demand could create the scenario that the more you pay the more safety features are added to the car to protect you the passenger over everyone else my thesis in a nutshell it still needs quite a bit of work but this is possibly the most relevant modern day take on utilitarian principles yet sources dobrindt alexander federal government adopts action plan on automated driving bmvi federal government adopts action plan on automated driving august accessed march http dobrindt federal government action plan automated drivinghtml emerging technology from the arkhiv why self driving cars must be programmed to kill mit technology review october accessed march self driving cars must be programmed to kill knight will self driving cars get a code of ethics mit technology review july accessed march to help self driving cars make ethical decisions tuffley david at last the worlds first ethical guidelines for driverless cars the conversation september accessed march http theconversationcomat last the worlds first ethical guidelines for driverless cars

459,so driver safety over a young woman and her small child
460,so driver safety over a young woman and her small child
461,i could see a legal and controlled lane change if it can avoid collision the car would know whether the adjacent lane is clear and how quickly it can safely make the lane change without losing control or rolling otherwise brakes it is none of this jumping onto the sidewalk business
462,you never have to break the speed limit to safely pass you can always just not pass also if a truck is parked in a traffic lane the truck is the one breaking the law i know it happens in city traffic but you never have to cross into oncoming traffic
463,if the larger group is on the track by their own choice or mistake and the smaller group isnt on trolley tracks you should hit the larger group the smaller group has a reasonable expectation of safety imagine a society where people cant feel safe because they can be actively killed for someone elses mistake its not an emotional response its a long term utilitarian response

465,it does matter though and if youve ever driven then you know that your life is constantly in the hands of other drivers if you knew all those other drivers would consistently follow all the rules of the road and didnt get tired drunk or angry wouldnt you feel safer from a security stand point

467,ive been hit as a pedestrian times once while still on the footpath the other two times was at an intersection with lights as i crossed with the pedestrian indicator i agree that as a pedestrian its important that you still look both ways crossings and traffic lights with pedestrians signals arent cross whenever theyre you have right of way cross when safe i have seen pedestrians step out on zebra crossings knowing cars have to stop but they dont physically give nearby cars enough time to stop that said i have a visual impairment and while i did look before i crossed i unfortunately missed the car that was barrelling up the parking lane because my brain doesnt really see movement well and i assumed when i saw a car in the parking lane it was well parked he was speeding and in the wrong lane but i did step in front of him without enough time for him to stop i believe that if i wasnt visually impaired i would have avoided that accident so thats kinda on me but also completely the drivers fault for driving in the wrong lane and planning to run the red light the other intersection was completely the drivers fault i was halfway across the road when the driver looked up from his phone saw a green light and just started driving off the green light was for trams not cars pedestrians cyclists and trams had a green signal cars and buses still had red the other time i was walking down the footpath on a small inner city commercial street and a car that was stuck in jammed traffic just randomly pulled to the left to try and get into the parking lane to cut traffic off but he was overzealous and mounted the curb straight into me thankfully the curb took most of the momentum out of the car so i was just knocked over thankfully the only injuries have been bruising and joint dislocations which im prone to anyway the annoying thing is the complete lack of self awareness so many drivers seem to have at their incompetence i can actually legally drive if i want despite my neurological issues with vision i can pass motor department eye exams because they dont test depth perception or movement tracking just can you read text from a few metres away however im not stupid i dont want to become a murderer or a corpse so i dont drive i recognise that just because i legally can doesnt mean i have the skills and ability to do so
468,it shouldnt datafatality analysis reporting system fars every _single_ fatal accident on our roadways has a nhtsa report generated everyone of these reports can be viewed online this includes things like driver and vehicle statistics but condition of the roadway position of passenger in vehicle sequence of events during the accident and whether or not the person was airlifted the hospital and the amount of time it took ive downloaded the fars database and created a program that will allow me to make queries against this data you can ask for example how many times had a car gone airborne before finally coming down and killing a pedestrian times in one incident it involved a pedestrian and his dog walking on a _different_ road that the vehicle departed from anyways as a result it shouldnt be a surprise that we already pay very close attention to vehicle safety and that the number of lives lost given the trillions of miles driven every year will be amazingly low _suicide_ claims more lives in a year than car accidents hell car accidents dont even make the top causes of deathhtm

472,no i mean the driverless vehicle needs to prioritize the safety of its own inhabitants before following an industry wide decision making process on who to hit in a situation where an accident cant be avoided i totally agree with you that driverless cars will statistically be safer than human drivers

475,i always find it funny how many people i run into who are so into this being a big deal about how the ai will make a decision and whatnot simply because they dont understand how stuff like this is programmed the systems are going to be incident avoidant as soon as there are predictors that an incident will likely occur theyre going to brake or change lanes braking is all but guaranteed if there is at all any confusion about a safe place to be because it reduces the damage no the real problem is going to be sitting at a stoplight for minutes because pedestrians keep jaywalking in front of you and your car wont inch forward
476,yes you are much less safe without automatic driving but you are putting your trust in people who have a horse in the race of your life
477,so tired of hearing this my father is a pilot yes theyre there for emergencies but they do also fly the plane all the time they do thorough safety checks before they taxi and take off and after they land and unboard etc the lack of credit that pilots are getting in this thread is an astounding show of ignorance no offense its far from just you

482,once we actually reach fully self driving vehicles they will be designed completely differently than todays vehicles the safety of people inside will probably be a much greater part of the design so crashes are going to be less dangerous for the passengers anyway i feel like this problem is overblown by people thinking that the cars will look and be designed the same way they are now

484,so youre saying given a choice you wouldnt swerve to avoid a pedestrian i think if between all the safety features it knows it could hit a traffic pole to avoid the pedestrian and not cause you grievous injury or death at that speed it should cars can be replaced whiplash heals people dont rise from the dead

486,it will be because they stepped into the road way illegally just making the point that outside of america most countries dont have a crime of jaywalking here in the uk afaik its l legal to cross in any safe place which could make pedestrian behaviour a bit less predictable still youre absolutely right im not sure people really are all that worried about driverless cars though i think the media just wants to give that impression
487,not spot on actually the statement if it hits someone a person would have hit that someone is patently incorrect particularly in these the early days of the technology anyone who has built out anything of the type be it facial recognition or text to speech will admonish you for the pitfalls of that thinking yes it will be safer in aggregate and yes it will often prevent accidents that a human being would not have but it is absolutely going to kill a bunch of people where if you had a reasonable driver behind the wheel there is no way they make that mistake

489,this is not true and almost kind of silly when you think about it stopping for an obstruction on a freeway is quite dangerous its far safer to swerve onto the shoulder or up an empty curb the most interesting thing about the trolley problem is when you start assigning different values to lives as circumstances change and from googles patents they seem to be assigning different relative values to different events and objects see here ratpagwordpresscomgoogle has its self driving car assign a secret value to your life patents it and to a lesser extent here ratpagwordpresscomwe review google patents so you dont have to for lighthearted analysis

491,ubers current failsafe model if im not mistaken but i havent looked into it enough to be able to answer this question with facts or sources
492,your fail safes can have fail safes too if you have enough of them and the car still fails at that point youre basically getting angry at lightning for striking a man being eaten by a shark
493,well theres obviously going to be some greyer areas should the car plow through children playing in the street because theres a chance swerving could strain your neck yes i agree that cost of life the car should favor the life of its own driver over pedestrians especially as to the cars knowledge it is obeying the traffic laws perfectly obviously it wouldnt and most likely couldnt do such an action if it were not within what it was pre programmed to believe is the legal and right way to go i would personally still have to say no deaths of any kind has to still be favored over even preventing the owner from injury if a car is going and it can avoid hitting a pedestrian by hitting a tree it should probably do that between airbags cars safety etc driver is unlikely to sustain any serious injuries at that speed but a pedestrian could still face some serious ramifications being run over by a car secondly if it is driver or someone else the car should favor the driver again even throwing morals asside the cars algorythm should at least believe it is in the right because it wouldnt have taken the actions that lead to that situation if its programming didnt tell it it was minimizing risk of these scenerios

495,i drive myself to town and back again every single day i can tell you unequivocally that i frequently do not prioritize my own safety its usually my time thats at the top of my list and i am not alone even a car that only prioritizes your safety of the time is going to do so more than any human driver including yourself that you have ever been in a car with

497,i was thinking the same thing but with a different angle set baseline non negotiable rules but when if i am a sixty year old whose kids are grown i want to be able to prioritize the safety of the kid who jumps out in front of my car especially if i am driving solo

499,yes because ai is a dumb overused term if its possible to safely maneuver around an obstacle thats what most path planning software will do if its not which is what the comment youre replying to assumes brake
500,no stopping is the safest thing honestly the reason that they tell you to drive around is because often times is pathetic flesh bags wont have the agility or wherewithal to stop the car in time
501,an open legal lane its not legal to cross a double yellow line or go onto the sidewalk even if they are clear the machine will do whats legal and safe or brake its not going to do any fancy decision making all the traffic laws already dictate what you are supposed to do the machine will just actually do it rather then panic in the case of squirrels the car might brake if no one is behind the car otherwise theyll be paste
502,honest question how many wrecks have you been in not trying to argue against your point but if a car is going fast enough to actually hit a tree instead of stoppibg short of it then its traveling fast enough to grievously injure or kill its occupant between thingsdebris entering into the vehicle and the inertia of a thousand pound vehicle coming to a sudden stop no internal safety component can guarantee injury prevention

504,i think the point is they will swerve off the road onto a side walk if the sidewalk is clear of obstruction the car knows that it cant keep driving on there but it would also be able to detect if theres an open space it can safely turn into and brake regardless of whether doing so is legal it wont turn into a crowded sidewalk sure but a deserted one sure why wouldnt they want it to do that
505,oh so we agree that it wont just brake then great but once evasive maneuvers are on the table as of course they will be then were already in the realm of having to design algorithms that must factor in risk probabilities how clear does the next lane over have to be for the car to make the lane change percent safe then some collisions will happen that could have been avoided or some lower number that minimizes total expected accidents over time but now the car will subject its occupants to risky emergency lane changes rather than gunning down pedestrians in its path and bam now were in trolley problem land
506,i feel like this whole thread is how rokos basilisk happens as long as you donate all you can to the development of self driving cars youre safe
507,thats exactly the point if the car following you was self drivung it would have a safe following distance and neithet the pedestrian or any of the people in any of the cars are hurt at the most you might have spilled some coffee the accident here would be rear ending and human error
508,what if we got rid of human based weaknesses for example humans need windows to see in a hypothetical ai driven vehicle those become expensive weak points why not make a car with no windows to lessen the risk of penetration in a crash why have all seats face forward when you could have rear facing seating so a deceleration pushes you back into a seat cushion rather than forwards into a dashboard or through a window why not have point restraints rather than point restraints and airbags at face or chest height to reduce distance to impact if you dont have to put glass there if a human being doesnt have to waste hours of their time driving can cars go at slower safer speeds id be fine only going if i can use the computer while i do if computers have better reflexes than humans can we go faster i think a big part of ai car design will be getting over the artificial restrictions imposed by our understanding of cars as driven once we decouple their design from the requirements of a human driver well do much better in terms of safety

511,ive been in a couple of wrecks that totaled the car i was in i was driving in one and a passenger in the other i had no injuries beyond a scrape on my chin from the airbag and some minor aches and pains i was also once hit by a car going about miles an hour which caused me to roll over the hood i was legally crossing at a crosswalk when the guy turned onto the road without looking my aches and pains were about times worse than my previous car accidents and i also had a concussion which caused headaches difficulty concentration and poor memory for about two weeks and i had extreme anxiety over the idea that my brain might never work the same again i would sure as hell prefer to be in a car that hits a tree than be in a car that hits a person cars are designed to minimize the force of the impact to the passengers and i would rather take my chances that those safety features wont protect me than mow down a person with zero protection knowing first hand how little it takes to cause them damage

513,absolutely not they will never leave the roadway except under an circumstance of a catastrophic mechanical failure never as part of a decision tree you cannot have cars deciding a path is safe to fly through someones front yard
514,makes me wonder if the driver was already sleepy enough to consider sleeping in his seat would it be safer for him to drive his car manually or was relying completely on current imperfect autopilot tech the safer course of action

516,the op is a known tesla shill and a mod here so ill probably get deleted i cant believe this is already front page and endorsing this as the future and not some incredibly reckless guy risking his life and the lives of others to shill for his carstock yes full self driving will be cool but its so far out and endorsing anything remotely close to reckless non attentive driving like this is undeniably less safe and leads to more deaths than if the driver of these self driving cars were alert behind the wheel the situation here is a look at me jerk on a public road causing other drivers to be distracted over riding his cars safety features and breaking the law so that people like the op can share the story around the internet for virality many will call this hyperbolic anger on my part but really its not because inevitably this will encourage other people to pull stunts like this and the cumulative behavior will inevitably lead to real loss of human life that would not otherwise occurred if a bunch of friggin brand zealots didnt try to idolize this guy as some sort of big brain future hero pay attention in your car and respect the fact that every giant block of metal hurtling down the road with deadly force in public space should have an attentive and sober driver until we have some sort of universal law dictating otherwise get this trash out of here when framed with such huzzah and admiration this isnt the same as me smoking weed at home in a state that hasnt caught up to expectations yet this is some dude doing something dangerous and stupid benefiting nobody

518,while this is dangerous and the driver should not have fallen asleep people fall asleep in cars unwillingly all the time and usually they cause a collision if people are just passing out then this is safer if theyre feeling comfortable enough to try to fall asleep on purpose then its reckless

520,other makes for years have had camera based systems that look at the driver to detect whether they are paying attention or not since telsa is so gung ho about their camera tech why dont they have that kind of safeguard
521,the things that drives me nuts about all of these articles is that they blame tesla for what people are doing anyone using a defeat device for their ap hand detection is a scumbag and deserves a steep ticket anyone intentionally thinking they can grab a nap is a scumbag putting people in danger and deserves an arrest immediately assume that the person is doing whatever is happening intentionally there will probably be dozens of people that accidentally fall asleep while driving this week and crash hopefully solo but many will crash into other people there will probably be at least a handful of seizuresstrokesdiabetic shock whatevers this week that cause someone to crash those things are most likely not that persons fault gloss over the fact that not one of these instances being rabidly spread all over the internet ends with a collision much less injury people have so many reasons why they crash some of them may be happening in these videos but everyones knee jerk reaction is fuck that guy for intentionally sleeping he should die and tesla is to blame how about acknowledge that this technology might save you from death if you or one of your fellow motorists has a medical emergency while driving it safely got this guy down the road for allegedly minutes without incident id say thats pretty remarkable
522,until the vast majority of vehicles are changed to self driving models you will not be able to just sleep safely in your car its not even the automatic drivers its the human ones that will still be causing accidents and speeding and everything
523,what i find funny is that people panic when some people are falling asleep at the wheel of self driving cars im currious if theyve compared the likelyness of falling asleep at the wheel in a self driving car vs doing so in a normal car obviously the difference is in non self driving cars people go a few feet and slam into the car ahead of them rather than traveling miles safely but it happens
524,and also you know because thats still highly illegal turns out until autonomous cars are deemed fully safe for roads the drivers must maintain full awareness of the road
525,if his little thing tied around that steering wheel fell off and he was still sleeping he would have slammed into somebody going miles per hour miladinovich said not true if autopilot detects that youre not gripping the wheel and you continuously ignore or arent awake to notice all of its warnings it will put your hazards on and gradually slow to a stop still not the safest situation on a freeway but its not like it just shuts autopilot off and lets you just drift until you crash ironically the thing falling off might have been the best thing that could happen since the warnings could have woken him up
526,i feel like the guy sleeping on tesla auto pilot was being a lot safer than the guy trying to film him from the car next to him while driving

528,i would rather have self driving teslas with sleeping humans driving around me on the freeway than other humans probably safer completely different story off the freeway that is the part that isnt fully there yet

530,im not sure how i could use this tech without being distractedor just reallllly bored like i often dont use cruise control just to stay more engaged id rather have a fully self driving car or a fully manual drive car with safety overrides from stuff sure

532,its going to be great and so much saferwhen that one accident happened where the biker was run over people where acted like it was the technologies fault but the guy literally just drove onto the street from behind an obstacleits sad that it happened but a human driver couldnt have prevented that

534,by next year you will br able to do this safely hes just jumping the gun a bit
535,people will be outraged but if these systems really are safer should they be
536,people will be outraged but if these systems really are safer should they be
537,whats the point of a self driving car if sleeping isnt an option its either safe or its not and if its not then i dont understand the appeal
538,arent teslas super safe when its slower and with a bit heavier traffic and how did he bypass the warnings if he was completely sleeping
539,i just feel any automation takes away from the reaction time of the driver if he doesnt have his hands the wheel and feet on the pedals i doubt he will be able to do much in the event something goes wrong self driving cars are definitely the future but till its completely safe to fall asleep behind the wheel they shouldnt be on the road
540,still safer than most of the assholes driving right now while on their phones lol
541,still safer than most of the assholes driving right now while on their phones lol
542,i find this both fascinating and maybe for lack of a better word stupid i think as a whole most of us humans are morons you can see it happening and im sure other prior events can do the same with the invention of smart phones people would rather answer a text than surveying the road as they drive or on a bike or when walking down stairs or walking in general you can put to the imagination all the accidents that do and will occur i used to joke about this sleeping in cars and now its happening doesnt matter if ai is safer than human driving its like trusting a stranger to watch your kid for minutes as you go to the bathroom

544,or expectations havent caught up with the tech that car drives more safely than most drivers not saying this is okay but the narrative is pretty much shit
545,i immediately thought of all the stories of people falling asleep at the wheel a causing accidents maybe its people purposely sleeping but theres definitely some people that are accidentally falling asleep and for them its much safer
546,i immediately thought of all the stories of people falling asleep at the wheel a causing accidents maybe its people purposely sleeping but theres definitely some people that are accidentally falling asleep and for them its much safer
547,but nobody was hurt right the autopilot safely did its job if the windows were dark tinted would they have even known something was amiss
548,theres probably going to be significant hiccups before this becomes a truly safe function of a car as long as there are other people driving poorly on the road self driving cars will be riskier than actually driving yourself
549,maybe we just need something like an idiot button you have to press every five minutes or so to prove youre awake if you dont press it maybe an audio cue and it automatically pulls over something like that i know it wouldnt be quite that easy still when you consider how many horrible accidents already happen when people fall asleep at the wheel id feel much safer if mr sleepy was in a tesla

551,psst trains are more efficient go faster than mph and you can sleep more safely on them autonomous vehicles require significantly more resources labor and energy to be able to transport the same number of people as a train or bus
552,this is the reason im not crazy about anything other than self driving when it goes to driving automation yes driver assist systems are meant to make driving safer but it can also be a crutch for poorly skilled or inattentive drivers as well possibly with disastrous results with lane change assist for example how many people know how let allow check their blind spots when changing lanes when they have those systems just because you have a system that does it when you forget doesnt mean you should stop doing it what if the system fails for some reason just as youre making the lane change self driving cars becoming commonplace cant come soon enough for me

554,i wish people would focus less on the idea of how it will be awesome to take car naps and more on the fact that the car manufacturer has put out an obviously unsafe feature yes obviously the guy who fell asleep is to blame and is most likely a complete idiot but responsibility isnt something that theres only a finite amount of and whilst this guy had a responsibility not to fall asleep at the wheel the manufacturer has a responsibility to not release features that will lead to unsafe use
555,theres a song about this dream youtuberyqvbovxdi and they may say its not for children of course it is and they may say its not for you its for you in a short while well be riding in cars that drive themselves chorus and well all just cruise can we just cruise and well all just cruise verse were climbing over the consoles in our sleep were marveling at how far the seats go back in a short while well be guided by stars that guide themselves im losing you itll be so safe and so helpful chorus and well all just cruise can we just cruise and well all just cruise
556,im sorry but every aspect of the current systems is designed to have a human paying attention and ready to take over at a moments notice its not good for snoozing on the highway its downright dangerous and its exactly the behaviour that is putting self driving back as it needs to be idiot proofed from people who do exactly what is being done by this guy on the highway an even bigger issue will be when people start being comfortable enough to fully turn around or lay back in their cars in the event of an accident whether their fault or not none of the current safety devices will protect from injuries as someones body hits the steering wheel side on or any other position not considered level will be a long long way away in all but the most controlled circumstances

558,you really do want to race us to the bottom huh catching zs on your commute might sound cute until it becomes the norm its great to have safety features which mitigate the risk of falling asleep or micro dozing of course but this has some greater implications to consider for the technocrats designing this

560,it dings increasingly loudly to try and alert the driver to take control and then safely brings the vehicle to a stop and turns itself off pretty sure theres videos on youtube of people testing it ive seen one at least
561,if the driver was sleepy drunk enough to consider sleeping passing out in his seat would it be safer for him to drive his car manually or was relying completely on current imperfect autopilot tech the safer course of action same logic but i doubt anyone would think this way

563,as an owner and an active participant in the tesla community i dont hear anyone talking about this in any way other than a guy being extremely reckless behavior like this whether its sleeping or trolling is incredibly frustrating and people who own and love the cars are regularly educating those less familiar with the current limitations of the tech this is the future and we can all talk about it that way because in the future it will be safe to do this after the technology is ready and federal regulations have been passed it is not safe to do this today not even close and these people are putting lives in danger by not understanding or willingly ignoring the limitations of the technology what i think probably happened here is this guy got sick of the tesla nag that requires your hands to be on the wheel and defeated it by tying some sort of weight to the wheel incredibly reckless move and then accidentally fell asleep incredibly reckless move despite this he hasnt crashed that is the one positive to take away from it the technology prevented a driver who fell asleep from injuring himself or others despite his reckless behavior its ok to applaud that while continuing to iterate to make this sort of thing harder to do recklessly
564,a self driving car is safer than you buddy

568,as someone who lives in southern california and drives around the and basically all of orange county all day every day i can safely say that this guy may be an idiot but him sleeping in a tesla is still safer than half the fucking idiots driving here and theyre actually awake i want to find the motherfuckers at the dmv who hand out licenses like lollipops at the doctor

570,this tesla are playing with fire and vastly over selling the safety of what is slightly smarter cruise control and this sort of shit is what happens its all fun and lols until that guys tesla hits a situation it cant handle which can include a badly painted lane marking and wipes out a family in a minivan while matey is asleep at the wheel

572,why do teslas not have a camera to ensure the driver is looking at the road while autopilot is active from the totals of the article i thought it was going to be an article about how dangerous this was and how tesla needs to update their safety constraints

575,looks like an asian guy too everyone is probably safer
576,i look forward to not being slaughtered by idiot human drivers computer driven cars will soon be then times safer than human drivers its coming problem is we have no safety net for the people who make a living by driving gonna be a nasty problem if we keep electing republicans

581,riskier riskier are you crazy even in these early days of automated driving theyve already proven to be much safer than human drivers do you know how many accidents humans cause compared to automated cars per capita maybe do some homework friend and that ratio will only spread more as tech improves

583,this is true but it can also be true that people kill other people on the road constantly without the help of automation and even with jerkoffs like this automation is way safer than manual driving even in the seminal state its in now you cant argue that its an easily provable fact

585,bout years ago i figured the safety reflectors on the highway could be used as solar powered radar or radio transmitters or light sensors all either of which could be understood by the cars navigation system
586,bout years ago i figured the safety reflectors on the highway could be used as solar powered radar or radio transmitters or light sensors all either of which could be understood by the cars navigation system
587,exactly how auto pilot responds when steering wheel doesnt detect your hands after that auto pilot will penalize you for x time so you cant enable it until the timer is over in addition to this i wonder if tesla cars one day will connect to your smart watch to detect your health like in the event you have a stroke or something and auto pilot will safely stop the car put hazard lights and call or hell even drive you to a hospital
588,we all know that this guy would have driven anyways and not taken the safest course of action
589,you are saying this like someone here is cheering for the guy and saying that what he did was totally right its obviously unsafe but its still an interesting example of something that would be sci fi a decade ago and is very real now
590,for some values of fully automated driving waymo is but uber killed someone after about million miles driven the national average is per million miles sure its a single data point but it definitely doesnt reinforce a blanket statement of fully automated driving is already safer than human driving

592,and it doesnt even matter everyone involved is now unsafe whether filming or sleeping the driver and everyone else knows this stunt will distract other drivers why because its illegal behavior on the road causing a scene
593,no and i hate to just go straight flamewar on someone but shut up and stop condoning people hacking their cars to sleep on public highways saying ridiculous things like robots can drive better than people is a childlike fantasy tale and no current tech or law should have anyone anyone tesla or not running around doing hack overrides of their cars safety features so that they can sleep while they drive this is so infuriatingly irresponsible and only undertaken by the biggest selfish turds who are trying to use a shared dangerous space to create viral youtube content to go viral on reddit there are hours of the day that you can sleep that dont involve going to bed for a useless minute nap while stunt driving on the sole road tens of thousands of people are using to get on with their lives who are not distracted and have to deal with someone next to them who is literally asleep just like we dont let jeff gordon guzzle jack daniels while going mph even though he won a bunch of nascar races the tech will be cool thats it right now its not and thinking anyone anywhere has the right to pull these behaviors is gross selfishness

595,this has nothing to do with automated trucking this has to do with someone intentionally falling asleep in their luxury sedan and being praised online by irresponsible idiots who dont care about public safety one is an acute danger involving attempts at shilling viral content online one is a macro concern

599,to be considered safer than a human driver it has to kill at most person per million miles the technology has not proved itself to be safer than a human driver despite what tesla pr says

601,which is my point a plane is arguably a much safer situation for an autopilot to fail and yet if both pilots were asleep during flight theyd be fired on the spot i dont see any situation in the remotely near future where people are allowed to be drunkasleepfuckingreadingwhatever while the car drives which is where i see this getting tricky because were not even close to that situation and people are already doing it anyways

607,i agree with everything you said and look forward to a future of self driving cars mobility would increase drastically and the economic benefits are enticing add cross country bullet trainsit would be so nice however the one hiccup i see is in the transportation of children they need car seats as a child passeneger safety technician instructor of car seats are either wrong seat for the child used improperly installed wrong or any combination thereof add having to put them in and take then out for every tripi only see that worsening parents sacrificing safety for convenience will also increase happens already about age unfortunately a car with car seats pre installed may sound like the solution but each child needs their own configuration to fit the seat properly and in the right direction all seats would need to be the same so parents know how to use it properly each brand has their own gimmick or special thing which is a pain in the ass and each family has a different number of kids with varying ages this is the majority of our population and then theres special needs children with even more specialized seats cars are designed around the safety of adults car seats adapt children to the safety features because their little bodies cannot withstand crash forces nor fit a standard seat belt without one until cars are designed for infants and children car seats will always be needed and our hopes of a fully autonomous vehicle world with be burdened with this issue edit fixed some words

610,totally agree i only have a concern on the safety department commuting while workingsleeping will be safe under the assumption that the other cars or the majority of them are self driving cars too if not there is always a risk on the other hand is driving the car yourself after work probably tired safer than let a self driving car to do the job

615,i think a hurdle with self driving cars being accepted will be the types of crashes the accident rates will be lower overall but well see some really stupid autopilot accident a human would not do and find it hard to trust also we accept humans make occasional errors but anytime autopilot makes an error even if safer overall everyone will be sue the car company out of existance etc im sure well get there but it will take a while

644,i acknowledge that there are diving situations and factors that create genuine accidents but there are many that happen do to ignorant people doing dumb illegal shit sure but a self driving car is better than a human at dealing with those people too p all the stuff you had to do and the things that had to go right for you to miss having an accident last night the autonomous car would have started handling faster seen coming from further away and reacted better and more safely accidents will still happen until we outlaw humans from public roads which is going to come because humans are terrible at driving but self driving cars will reduce those accidents and the severity of them dramatically

672,i dont buy the assumption that self driving cars are safer where is the long term data
673,not a bad problem to have i mean literally thats what donnation means i dont need it anymore compare that to the situation of charities that report because so many people scam online there are less and less people willing to donate online the general idea was we have unneccesary deaths people die one from a gunshot wound to the head the other one from a missing liver translant lets cut that short by taking the otherwise still useable gunshot victims liver and sowing it into the other patients body we can save one of them guaranteed the idea was never we have a right to those organ numbers we have a right to now demand those organs the idea was never we now get to complain because large numbers of organs are not there where we need them the general idea is innovate your way out of this for example allow some donors to decide for themself how their organs will be used for example i myself would have no problems with my organs being donnated to a poor schlob who never won anything to specify that if my reccipient has plans like climb mount everrest ride the bike or have an active and healthy social life go tell him to fck himself and prioritise the bottom of the list these people whom you wouldnt trust with a fresh vegan liver give them my liver put a smile on their faces shit on the guy who plans to run with the bulls or who has an instagramm account donnate your heart to the bottom of the transplant waiting list your liver to an recovering alcoholic your skin to someone who looks like a two and otherwise would need skingrafts from their own ass and your dick to someone who put chronic masturbation under hobbies let my shit go to people who actually appreciate it not take it for granted i could see a lot of people out of their free will donnating their organs and actually feeling good about it skin blood liver shit i take it like with the computer if anything can be reused before you toss it into the biohazard bin and burry it in an abandoned mineshaft be my gust grab what you need to when it is clear that i dont need it anymore just dont give it to the prick with the hope and stars in their eyes give it to themiserable bastard that has never won anything and make them for once feel like they own the world the downside would be that you would actually have to respect those wishes and such you know i will not be around to check anymore but i am sure it would be a hoot to tell mister schmidt from b that the medical board has a heart for him even though the medical board cant legally give that heart to anyone else but too often when a board decides who gets the organs and who gets a second chance i wanna wipe the smug grins off of their faces and go yea she ugly as fuck but shes a two so the rmeistermalkav clause grips and she gets his skin yes all of it see what she needs cut off the rest make a trendy bag out of it and this is where i see the problem the doctors would never agree to actually respect the donors wishes and hand over their power they would allways push for this little bit of extra of finger waving of such and of course there would be the the people that go i want my body parts to go to someone who is white i know it is harsh but better then publically whining about how fewer transplants we will have because more and more people will surive would be to take the good with the bad just increase the numbers every racist bastard who gets his wish means one fewer place on that list needing to be filled an other option would be medically assisted suicide i am dead serious on that one if all you care is get places of of that list go fuck your ethics board untill they bleed from both ends and offer assisted suicide have a suicide coaster in the back that kills you in a painless safe and guaranteed way in exchange for the right to harvest the organs of course respect these peoples wishes what they want to be done with the organs and the grafts but in the end if you are good enough to whine publically about the list let me remind you that if you pushed for harvesting rights to suicide victims bodies your numbers would look quite different yes there would be the option about not doing harm but that could be done with a patient activated mechanism or and this would be my preferred option actually look into technology look into artificial hearts look into stem cell research and make sure all your people on that waiting list understand that if they vote the people against stem cell research out of office they may actually do the world a bigger favor then by leaving them in and just signing up to be donors just you know become single issue voters for an election my best case only hand the advertising contracts to inform about organ donnations to people who are donors make fun fact sheets allow me to specify my wsh that nobody who is an sjw should get anything from me but if there is any miserable sick son of a bitch that is just a grouch give him my body and tell him to toast me once in a while staple it in and see how it goes use what you can from my body and go fuck your ethics board if you can get it out of my body without retching uncontrollably you are entitled to have it if any of my body ends up in an art project go buy a big pack of smokes for the nearest smoker and tell him my story but i would rather rot completely intact underground and make sure maggots and shit get my body then go to the afterlife with the secure knowledge that my bodyparts are taken for granted and to be distributed as seen fit by a team of medical experts
674,self driving cars will exacerbate organ shortages unless we start killing more people in car crashes how can we possibly blame safer cars for this problem i dont think the solutions mentioned in this article are good enough we should address the common and preventable cause of disease that warrant transplant elimination of tobacco smoking abuse of alcohol abuse of narcotics

676,self driving cars are going to be one of the biggest epitomes of totalitarian orwellian style enslavement in the future the joking comments on here about programming them to crash and kill someone every so often actually isnt far off from what will happen in real life i can almost sense the cognitive dissonance of half sarcasm through my computer screen yes you can bet your ass that the likelihood of an autonomous vehicle mysteriously driving you off of a bridge will be higher if you end up on too many of the governments naughty lists that should be common sense for anyone with a pulse and who doesnt have their head up their ass as for the overall lowering of the mortality rate it would appear that the proponents of driverless cars are missing a very important point that a one in chance of dying due to human error is better than a one in chance of dying due to a computer error its the same reason that people who have no problem driving a car on an mile an hour highway where they know full well that they have a better chance of being killed than in a plane crash are terrified of flying and its for a good reason its not some irrational thought process that goes on in the human mind its about being in control of ones own physical well being which is a right by default it goes hand in hand with the proverb of those who are willing to give up a little freedom for a little security deserve neither and will receive none i liken the push for autonomous vehicles to the war on guns and the war on cash only to the half witted yuppie imbeciles is it about the promotion of things like safety for the common good and convenience for the individual to ignore the obvious dark side is to drink the technocratic cool aid

680,and in other news there was a protest by buggy whip manufacturers that going over mph is medically unsafe
681,what a problematic dilemma to have i dont think we ought to give a second thought to adopting new technologies which increase personal safety just because it will mean fewer people lose their lives to save the lives to other people

687,well luckily for people on the transplant list nobody wants a self driving motorcycle and theres still a large opposition to compulsory helmet laws its morbid but true and no motorcycle fatalities will not be entirely eliminated by the self driving cars around them riding will certainly become safer but iirc the majority of fatal motorcycle accidents are caused by rider error if you ride check the donation box next time you renew your license

689,my concern with increasing automation is the loss of jobs sure saving lives is a good thing but self driving cars means we wont need cab drivers or uber drives so less jobs there police forces wont be writing as many traffic tickets so theyll need less police and have to find other sources of revenue less doctors will be needed tow truck drivers city repair crews you get the idea safety is a good thing but i cant help but think its only good to a point if high levels of automation cause long term misery by removing gainful employment

691,the bigger problem with self driving cars is how slow they will go to keep the passengers safe
692,yeah this isnt the terrifying part what we need to start doing is training the massive workforce that are truck drivers to learn a new skill do you think they will want to pay a person to do the job a machine can do more efficiently cheaper safer oh and they dont have that problem of sleeping this will be a pain point on the economy because once the change happens it will be so rapid they wont know what hit them

698,isnt it a little silly to say that these two processes need to or should be be related d printed organs would greatly improve medicine with or without organ donations from car crashes assuming automated cars cause less deaths that is a great improvement regardless of increased deaths from those waiting for organs how many people die in car crashes per person saved from organs obtained from a car crash how many people could be saved today with d printed organs i did some math transplants were performed in i read in or transplants come from car accidents so people were saved in from car accident organ donations however people died in car accidents so for car accidents to donor transplant every one life saved about people die this doesnt count how many of those were failed transplants i think it is fair to say lets lower automotive deaths asap about people die each year waiting for a transplant even with car crashes i think it is safe to say lets lower that via advanced technologies asap
699,im thinking that the first wave of self driving cars will be able to deal with motorcycles motorcycles are already in the roads they wouldnt be able to put cars on the road that completely ignore bikes more self driving cars will make motorcycles much safer to drive

701,self driving cars will almost certainly make riding safer half of all motorcycle fatalities involve another vehicle ive had no shortage of close calls that were entirely due to an idiot behind the wheel of a car a self driving car on the other hand would be looking at me teslas autopilot can recognize when its a bike in front of you vs a car

706,you cant have one without the other its either freedom or safety
707,you cant have one without the other its either freedom or safety
708,if self driving cars are a safe as they are expected to be it wont take too long for insurance rates to reflect that owning a manual drive car could eventually become a relative luxury given that they should be vastly more expensive to insure
709,i used to agree with the idea in the title now after seeing the accidents coming from tesla and uber im not so sure that were using a good enough safety framework even if we allow the code to be closed source we should allow the general public a way to find and submit bugs currently theres a pilot in these cars and heshes supposed to take over in case something goes wrong yet in the uber case the driver wasnt paying attention id make it mandatory to have a system in the car that alerts the driver if hes distracted farm distracted driver detection and exceeding a quota should be treated as reckless driving another thing im suggesting is a database of all accidents where a self driving car was involved and if the police can provide a way to recreate the conditions of an accident all makers of self driving cars need to pass all previously known tests before releasing major updates

713,okay im going to disagree here i completely agree that the end goal requires massive investment and will be worth every penny but i disagree that the investment has to be human life i would also add that the deathsdistance driven ratio isnt in favour of self driving cars right now so our current underdeveloped models still dont meet the criteria in the headline there are a number of new technologies that people look into that need to be trialled in industries where safety is critical aircraft and nuclear are the names that jump to mind the safety systems are tested rigorously and continually developed in light of new information designs are constantly scrutinised both in plans and once built and arent trialled unless it can be justified the investment to have a rigorous testing procedure should be paramount the uber testing procedure seems way too nonchalant considering that the fatality they caused happened when there was a single tester who was bored to distraction imagine being told there was a test nuclear reactor with a single operator distracted by their phone as much as uber are hoping to get their self driving cars to market i dont think they care enough about if they work to ever get there otherwise theyd fill each car with a small team

715,people are going to die at first get over it is probably not the greatest stance to take if youre trying to promote widespread adoption in order to flatten the learning curve for the driving algorithms when theres a perfectly viable alternative available that people have been using for years most people will be happy to say no thanks let me know when youve worked all the kinks out and then ill think about it even if they are statistically more safe in an autonomous vehicle the technology needs strong adoption because truly safe autonomous driving is going to require millions upon millions of miles driven so that nearly every combination of scenarios can be encountered and appropriately mitigated through software learning then theres the whole casualty insurance elephant in the room that no one seems to want to address
716,complete and utter bullshit if these corporations cant find the money and resources to do this safely then they need to find another business it is absolutely possible to simulate the environment they aim to operate in they just need the data which they should be paying to collect en masse this is no different to developing any other critical system you simulate the production environment and test in it before you deploy to production proper its in the article title they are trying to do autonomous vehicles on the cheap at the expense of human lives by slamming underdeveloped models into production i say they can take their lobbyists and piss off in the interim to reduce deaths on the roads governments need to make it difficult to get and maintain a licence as what passes for driving nowadays is pathetic theres way too many on the roads that have no aptitude for defensive driving for those who agree with the bullshit are you happy to be one to drive one of these underdeveloped models and sacrifice your life for the greater good
717,it is not rational for an excellent driver to cede control to an inferior machine it is reasonable enough i suppose for a bad driver to cede to a superior machine then again it is even more reasonable for a bad driver to pay attention and adopt safer driving practices so im not seeing us reasoning our way into self driving vehicles that kill us tl dr statistical improvements in survival rates do not necessarily translate to what make sense for individuals

719,i agree but think a lot of laws need to be worked out soon who is responsible for any accident thats the ultimate question who pays for damages and do we convict the makers or the person who is behind the wheel what happens if it is a complete accident on all parts i remember reading some cars will put the safety of the occupants of the vehicle above all else as a luxury design to be sold almost like a safety feature that takes it as collateral damage cars like that should be highly illegal imo imagine if an automated car chooses to hit a person on the sidewalk because there is no other way to avoid a collision and save the occupants that in my mind is unacceptable morally right now human drivers are at the mercy of the human condition with the eventually increase of automation we can literally pre program ahead of time what we want to happen this is just one tiny facet of so many questions that will need to be answered

721,i never understand this mentality self driving cars will never be accepted if you are asking people to accept that self driving cars can kill people its like asking people to get on a roller coaster ride but people may die on it randomly but people should accept that risk for roller coaster ride sure you might argue that human drivers have higher statistics of road accidents than self driving cars but youre ignoring that people think that in human driving those who drive properly and follow rules have significantly low risk of being in an accidents and its true too to some extent so theres an element of control here so human psychology has a tendency to think that if i drive properly ill be rewarded by safety pay attention follow the rules and my driving will keep me protected but thats not the case with self driving cars even if youre a good driver it does not have any outcome on how car drives thats like taking away control from the hands of humans its like playing russian roulette where its totally upto luck and not your driving whether youll be killed on this particular car ride or not so everytime you get in self driving car it may be your last ride and you can do nothing about it i think this will be a significant barrier in mass adoption of self driving cars unless they make their system perfect

723,nah you shouldnt have to just accept loss of life if self driving cars will kill people they shouldnt be on the road youre an idiot at least with human drivers theres accountability no one is held accountable for self driving cars killing people yet we have the means to make them safe wannabe tech bros like you think lives dont matter to progress lol clown
724,and one more side effect of complete autonomous driving at least in developing countries one i live in is that lot of traffic congestion can be avoided no one follows lanes here actually on most of the roads there are no marked lanes most of peak hour traffic is due to people trying to outsmart others by cutting to the front of slow moving lanes by breaking away and trying to get ahead of the lines which just adds more to the problem at least autonomous algorithms wont be this dumb they will definitely make the roads safer and consume gasoline or electric charge more efficiently because they wont rev mad when there is traffic ahead

726,if people dont come to accept self driving cars maybe manufacturers will just continue loading them with standard safety features like automatic braking and collision avoidance then even more advanced ones until driving is basically like the close door button on an elevator the wheel and pedals will just be there to convince us we have control

744,i feel like we currently have the technology to make cars safe in the event of a major crash we just dont apply it bc its inconvienient or looks dumb like a full body strap in
745,retrospectively this is true but i think accepting such a fact will lead to manufacturers abusing and cheating safety measures as they already do now their excuse probably will be this exact reasoning if were too normalized with this fact
746,retrospectively this is true but i think accepting such a fact will lead to manufacturers abusing and cheating safety measures as they already do now their excuse probably will be this exact reasoning if were too normalized with this fact
747,yep the fact that there are few enough accidents involving autopilot that they still make the news should be an indication that they are safer than human drivers the autopilot is programmed to give a shit about other cars on the road humans not so much
748,yep the fact that there are few enough accidents involving autopilot that they still make the news should be an indication that they are safer than human drivers the autopilot is programmed to give a shit about other cars on the road humans not so much
749,if they get them safe enough the manufacturers can build payouts to those killed into their business model then ill start to believe they are ready for mass deployment
750,yeah its insane how much death we tolerate as normal on the roads with human drivers but anecdotal accidents with automated systems are treated like some epic disaster its the same craziness that happens with human spaceflight a chopper with marines crashes its one day of news a space shuttle blew up with astronauts and the entire space program ground to a halt for years afterward and today we dont even have human space launch because nasa is insisting on proving the safety of things before even flying them experimentally meanwhile how many people just died on the roads in the time it took me to write this irrational priorities hold humanity back we tolerate death where its least meaningful and act like its an unacceptable sacrifice where its highly justified to take risks and deal with the consequences

752,i struggle with this a bit i just dont like the idea of self driving cars ive driven now for years not so much as a scrape or any infractions to speak of im a good driver and others will often comment on my spidey sense that i can tell what people around me are going to do before they do it little things like their lane position etc and i know if theyre coming into my lane without indicating or anything thats going to cause me to alter my path i struggle to think that a computer will be better than me at this im also pretty sure my brain can process more things at once than a computer programme science may prove me wrong in this theres other moral things like how can you pre programme a response to the trolley cart problem that is a decision that could only ever be made in the moment as a pretty much reflex action computers cant do that and whilst im sure theyre pre programmed to save a driver cars are relatively safe places so maybe it would be better to hit an object rather than a person who cant take the force of it we dont know until we get to that moment also at that point lets say the driverless vehicle hits a kid whos fault is that the cars the manufacturers it seems like its just me who suffers this others i speak to seem to love the idea but i love driving id hate to be penalised because i dont let the computer think for me just a note im not talking about additional sensors parking sensors etc are pretty useful in larger vehicles and anything thats going to give the driver information about an area he cant see easily is going to be good im referring to removing the driver from the thought process
753,the article has an inherently flawed view of the situation presently driverless cars arent even close to being as safe as human drivers
754,if somehow the lawyers are prevented from suing the automobile industry out of existence for ai related fatalities i think we are going to end up with a situation where people who can afford to trade in their cars every three years or so and thus maintain certification will be granted special privileges that we take for granted today such as driving on the interstate highway system while everyone else will be restricted to surface streets and low speeds overall safety wont be improved but transportation will become much more convenient for the upper class for once im rooting for the lawyers

756,yeah no humans are actually excellent drivers incredibly good as long as theyre doing the actual driving and not fucking about have you ever seen pilots view from f or redbull air race shits insane and they very rarely crash absolute majority of road incidents are due to driver error if we remove the human from that seat then id expect all associated causes for a crash to go away with it i dont want an sdc thats safer than the average human because average human texts behind the wheel goes over the limit when its not safe to do so overtakes on blind corners etc i want sdc thats safer than a really good attentive responsible driver if they cant provide that well then i guess ill stick to driving myself

758,self driving cars will be turned against us in a time of war any nominal gain in safety will come at the cost of future freedom

760,if these things are going to be as safe as they say they will there will be a side effect to that fewer car accidents means fewer organ transplants most transplant organs come from mvas one hundred thousand people die every year while waiting on a list for an organ transplant now and the longer you are on the list the less chance you have of being healthy enough for the transplant should the organ become available if you are rich you can get screened at multiple facilities around the world and get on more than one list in other countries more poor and middle class will die not from car accidents but from not being able to access a suitable donor in time
761,its a weird dilemma when our lives are in our own hands we feel like we have control even tho were statistically less safe than having a robot drive for us hm
762,im going to be starting my masters in control systems engineering with a focus in autonomous vehicle communication in about a year my firm believer about self driving vehicles is that they are safer but only in a system composed mostly of autonomous vehicles reduce risk of human error create a self referencing grid ect this will never happen because the cost of the technology keeps it out of financial reach of most of the population so people will continue to die and we will continue this debate till were blue in the face

764,we will never eliminate all deaths from vehicles there are just too many people and cars interacting the shear numbers involved almost demand that some bad things are going to happen im ok with pedestrian deaths by self driving cars as long as its still less than the deaths caused by human driven cars one person could die everyday and it would still be the safest form of transportation in human history ill even take it a step further we could have to sacrifice one person everyday to feed the bloodlust of the deranged automated cars in order to keep their kind in check and it would still be the better option the highest fatality numbers from automated cars will be fractions of the lowest numbers of fatalities from human driven cars
765,every time im on the freeway during rush hour i see how badly we need self driving cars this will be a game changer in the us because it will give people a lot of their time back we are way too busy as a nation and self driving cars will allow us to do other things during our commutessafely
766,i think this is the same reason itll be a long time before air travel is fully automated and there will always at least be a technician or somebody similar on board in case things go wrong right now the airline is working towards taking th first officer out of the cockpit but even that will take time to change faa rules company policy which also requires faa approval for an aircraft to be developed and approved and then for the airlines to be looking to buy a brand new fleet which requires new support staff new multi million dollar simulators etc and thats too still have a pilot in the plane those issues aside i cant imagine the pilot less plane will be welcomed by the general public for the exact reason you stated many see that we can develop the technology to a very safe level but there will probably always be a paranoia about it by the general public the city of atlanta tried to put in a conductorless metrotrain and there was such an outcry about it the city pays somebody to sit at the front in a uniform but no controls to do anything i dont remember the exact story and cant find a source but its a story a heard about might be bullshit but i think the point is the same about people freaking out about it as driverless cars become more popular people may become more accepting of it but only time will tell
767,for many and you can see posts hinting at it in this very thread its not about safety or convenience or whats best for everyone they just dont want to give up control same as the gun debate privacy vs security debate and so many others especially in the us if anything is going to happen the decision makers have to accept that its going to piss a lot of people off and just do it

769,will most likely theyre already much safer the only things that make them unsafe are the poor infrastructure and the few freak scenarios where our physics calculator brains are useful out only gets better from here man i cant wait until old beat up autonomous cars finally hit the tertiary craigslist market so i can afford one
770,will most likely theyre already much safer the only things that make them unsafe are the poor infrastructure and the few freak scenarios where our physics calculator brains are useful out only gets better from here man i cant wait until old beat up autonomous cars finally hit the tertiary craigslist market so i can afford one
771,this whole argument presumes autonomous cars are better drivers than people theyre better drivers than some people the vast majority of people are reasonably safe drivers thats why its not a non stop bloodbath out there so the question is are they better than the median driver
772,pfuck that main moral dilemma is what is valued more occupants time and wellbeing versus safety of a pedestrian

774,i drive a lot and not a day goes by where i dont see all three of the following idiots nearly rear ending someone due to texting idiots driving mph over the speed limit weaving through freeway traffic idiots tailgating at very unsafe speeds im all for self driving cars
775,i generally like the idea of self driving cars and electronics in vehicles overall until we start having the conversation about the fact that government is likely going to be able to control our vehicles remotely by law one day itll be billed as a huge advancement for public safety for law enforcement to be able to disable someones vehicle remotely but thats some orwellian shit i dont want any of

777,i think the real problem with avs is going to be when one does kill someone and someone now needs to determine was the av or the deceased persons more at fault if it is decided that it was the av who is responsible the owner of the vehicle or the company or companies behind the avs safety equipment which may be a lot more than just one company and this is with a simplified scenario depending on what the final technology requires what happens if external sensors or signal broadcasters are required by avs just to function reliably im thinking especially of snowy or icy conditions where the cars on board sensors may not be able to detect the edge or center of a road reliably right now roads and road signals are mostly paid for by the public if an av kills someone and it was icy and there is a question about whether some road implanted signaling device failed does that make that citycountystate partially responsible this is likely to provide for entirely new departments of lawyers being required in many legal firms to handle the increased demand for both prosecuting and defense lawyers

779,i feel like people are so afraid of change that as soon as there is one bad sign they freak out bad stuff happens regardless of technology people die every day because of human error the future is autonomous cars so its time to embrace the future and move it along quicker because the faster we move it along the faster that it can be safe
780,pehaps we should have self driving war machines first humans seem to accept new things more easily when they were explicity desinged to kill and were then made safer and more useful
781,pehaps we should have self driving war machines first humans seem to accept new things more easily when they were explicity desinged to kill and were then made safer and more useful
782,thank you i have been telling people this for a while now there will always be accidents but in the end humans will always cause way more than self driving cars currently the media is part of the problem they always highlight when a tesla crashes but never mention how many miles they have also driven safetly not to mention some of the crashes are indeed cause by human error
783,the key point is not only do they start out safer than the average human driver they get better over time something you cant say about the standard of human drivers i dont think it will be many years before manual human drivers are banned from key roads together with motorcyclists and cyclists and there will be many more prosecutions for jaywalkers

785,i feel like we all know there will be loss of life although every time it happens the media acts all crazy and completely ignores the fact that self driving cars once networked will be far safer than people the media sucks

787,tldr scary to use humans to test new tech the world is desensitized to loss of human life similar to companies under the fda autonomous vehicle companies should prove their products are safe and effective before using you might die but thats okay slogan this is terrifying ideology for example a woman killed her newborn in a town elsewhere in my state by shaking it because it wouldnt eat the ct scan showed six blunt force injuries on the brain everyone finds this abhorrent how is abortion not on the same page a human fetus is a human too i digresspeople die in cars and that is a terrible thing to happen someone dies in an autonomous vehicle and thats for the cause someone getting killed is such a desensitized event in the world now that the selling point for future tech egautonomous vehicles is that some people will die during testing and that is okay some people died at sandy hook elementary was that okay in order to improve security at schools no and if you think it was you extremely need to rethink some things about yourself heres the reality of the situation loss of life is never okay every person is unique and wonderful and beautifully made never should there be technology or ideas that we explore where human mortality is not the utmost concern autonomous vehicles shouldnt be sold under the notion that youre an early user so you may die but thats a sacrifice we are willing to make because our product is better at driving than you a la lord farquad youtubehikuxfcsreu its nonsensical death comes for us all thats the consequence of our sin yes we accept that but sacrificing people for technological advancements isnt that illegal not to mention hugely unethical enmwikipediaorgwikiunethical_human_experimentation read the united states section the kefauver harris drug amendment to the federal food drug consumer act requires companies to prove safety and effectiveness of their products theyre prioritizing human life and wellness now as law requires why arent autonomous car companies trying to sell their products with the focal selling point being the best safety and effectiveness too surely this is being investigated surely the autonomous vehicle companies arent experimenting why should we accept a product that isnt proven effective and safe in the highest degree i dont think we should accept it not until its been shown to be safe there are good and bad drivers on the roads every time we get in a car we risk our lives but we take penicillin because we know its been proven effective and safe and labeled as such i drive my particular car because its been proven safe and effective at keeping me that way i buckle my seatbelt for the same reason its proven to be safe and effective why shouldnt an autonomous vehicle be subject to the same parameters im okay with downvotes felt like adding my two pence this is a hot topic rall we need to be discussing this

789,hmmm in other autopilot type environments such as aircraft ships etc there are two variables that wont translate well into the autonomous vehicle situation cars are maintained in a vastly different manner professional maintenance teams of highly trained persons ensure all the systems are operating properly and even then things fail with the home user neglecting repairs maintenance there will never be the same level as in the professional transportation industry think along the lines of an old unsafe car burning oil because the owner doesnt maintain the car people will never be as diligently trained as the professional transport industry they wont care theyll play around with the technology and cause general mayhem think your neighbor burning rubber you son that keeps getting into accidents or those motorcycle riders that are aggressive to the point of being dangerous there will need to be a fundamental change in these two arenas to have a functional safe and efficient av
790,itll be safer in the end when all cars are self driving
791,itll be safer in the end when all cars are self driving
792,an improvement over a human drivers ability except captchas s im honestly sorry but i think even the most underdeveloped models will most likely be an improvement over some human drivers abilities some of us have gone our entire lives without being in an accident when ai can rock a vehicle out of snow anticipate oncoming and upcoming potential problems shoulders uneven terrain etc then then perhaps theyll be an improvement over a human driver yes accidents with ai will occur and in good conditions theyll function safely and autonomously but the processing power needed for improvisationforesight is a ways off in my humble opinion
793,yeah nah theres no way in hell im giving up my right to drive cars are my life blood and im not giving them up because some bastards afraid of driving want to take power away from us and give it to machines under the guise of safety

795,no we dont have to accept that we can just build transit systems that are intrinsically safe instead of retaining the horse and buggy without the horse now with a computer trying desperately to emulate a human which is brutally hard skytran for instance if you have to design in criteria like ok we have an emergency who should the car kill pedeistrains or the occupants youre designing a shitty ass useless system that has no justification for existing i just cant believe this massive blind spot everyone seems to have cars are a bad technology for transporting people theyre also a very bad technology for transporting goods both those things can be done immensely better with something like maglev rail passive or active maglev depending on size people traffic on the local plane should be walking cycling or electric buggies that move pretty slow the transit systems that move people further should be at least meters in the air to make collisions impossible why wouldnt we build faster safer and cleaner options naah its too hard and you have to build too much lets just keep maintaining these stupid ass expensive roads and kill people on them with metal boxes hurtling out of control that makes so much more sense what

797,the real issue is taking that portion of the economy which can be as high as and ripping it out of the hands of the in a time when social safety nets are under attack that will definitely kill a lot more people than driving ever did

799,a couple years ago all the big players in the self driving car business came forward one at a time and basically said they would self insure all of their own cars basically no car owner is going to be willing to own a self driving car if they would have to pay for its mistakes and theres a pretty good chance that even if individual people did sign up for that it wouldnt take many expensive accidents before the courts would start assigning damages to the car companies also transportation is one of the few areas in the us that still has relatively strong consumer protection regulations partly because the national highway transportation safety board has veto power over which vehicles get to use the highway and the nhtsb would insist on the manufacturers running the insurance im not positive how exactly the insurance is funded whether these companies are parking the risk with third party risk assessment companies for a smoother potentially lower price or if theyre just going to flat out pay any damages from the company slush fund

801,what they are also considering is to connect the insurance to the individual car and not the person such that a car which has made no crashes in the last years will get a cheaper insurance or a car from a manufacturer with cars with a great safety record will get a lower monthly fee

803,insurance companies will surely develop a new policy for that given that they are said to be safer than drivers they are therefore better for insurances it means more profit for them i predict there will be at least three kind of insurances for self driving cars the one were the manufacturer themselves become an insurer a car insurance where you are not allowed to drive the car which will be much cheaper than the cheapest one at the momentless accident means more money for the insurer a mix of both where you have a manufacturer insurance and a normal car insurance who is liable will depend on who was driving at the time of the accident

806,i have my commercial license i have driven medium trucks tankers dumps flatbeds excavators backhoes and operated around gas electric steep slopes etc etc with all that i feel safer around leaking gas lines and failed power lines than on public roads ive seen that some people simply have no business behind the wheel but in the us its a necessity to drive whether or not you can or should you do thats the problem so im all for sdvs and mass transit make a license harder to get and maintain also use your signals you stupid dicks if your merging you dont have the right of way

814,i see a huge dip in safety between driver assist features and level autonomous because there is confusion as who is in control there is this attempt to blame human drivers for not catching the mistakes of auto pilot but even if youre paying attention youre going to wait for the auto pilot to react this adds a second or two to your reaction time with driver assist features like pedestrian braking the car catches your mistake not the other way around

816,my ex works programming self driving cars and what you are saying is a frequent topic of conversation in his office that most people including the ones working there arent willing to accept once theyve swallowed the self driving car kool aid self driving cars can really only ever be a safe reality in cases like garbage trucks where you have a pre planned route and a safety handler present shuttle routes on places like campuses which are a comparatively controlled environment enhanced cruise control like tesla and possibly services like uber where you would have a driver remotely controlling the car the idea that youre gonna have cars driving themselves all over the freeways is absurd as long as people drive in those roads theres just too many variables that make the self driving cars into an enormous liability however he thinks that might be the plan once everyone prefers self driving cars you could turn the highways into routes for the cars in the way few people can drive manual today few people will drive at all and just rely on this service and yea it will be a service people wont own cars anymore so self diving eliminates our autonomy and need to drive its amazing technology for some applications but not all

818,i get it you think you are in control and that youre not at risk but you most definitely are good drivers die every day by the dozens and this technology will reduce the fatality rate immensely yes it introduces a new agent into the equation robo driver and that robot wont be perfect but it will be better its natural to fear this new risk and to want to stick with what youre used to but the net risk is going to go down big time allow me to illustrate hypothetically lets say your chances of dying of cancer in the next years is but a new free pill came out on the market that can almost eliminate your risk of cancer dropping your probability of cancer death to however that pill also adds a side effect that may cause it to actually give you cancer the probability of that happening is so this new pill lowers the probability of cancer death by a huge amount but in very rare cases it actually causes cancer death should you take that pill of course you should take that pill which will reduce your probability of cancer death from to it would be dumb to get caught up on the fact that the pill adds a new risk of cancer when it more than offsets that new risk by eliminating of the current risk the pill way improves your probability of avoiding death overall so dont be a dummy use it by the same token we should adopt the new safer form of transportation sure the robot could fuck up and kill you but the odds of it happening will be lower than very good human drivers yourself included killing you there will be no reward for taking the extra mortality risk associated a human driver the machines are already better than humans at most maneuvers and it is a matter of time until they dominate us across the board it will be very soon only hard headedness fear of change distrust of machines and ego will hold this process back prepare yourselves to take this damned pill people it will almost certainly improve your life and the lives of others like the elderly it will reduce fatalities and injuries it will solve traffic jams it will be soooooo much better embrace it

820,totally agree everyone here seems to think the tech already exists and is completely safe when the best that is out there is enhanced cruise control long long way before fully autonomous
821,while in most cases with non self driving cars one or more human drivers is responsible for a crash there are certainly cases where a car malfunction is the cause in such cases its still possible for the malfunction to be the drivers or owners fault a result of improper maintenance for example but if it can be proven that a faulty design is responsible the cars manufacturer can definitely be held liable for financial damages in a self driving car theres still a possibility that the driver may be held responsible due to their operation of the car or its maintenance so drivers may still need to be insured corporations certainly are risk averse but they can collect revenue from the sale that can be applied to the cost of liability insurance a safer self driving car will cost less for the manufacturer to lay off financial risks to an insurer we can only hope that arrangement stays in place so the public isnt forced to pay for the risks and costs of poorly performing self driving designs for example if manufacturers get government to hold them harmless for crashes in self driving cars the public will have to eat the cost either by driverowners insurance or people just plain not being compensated for being killed or injured

823,the issue though comes from the bad drivers who believe they are good drivers and who therefore do not adopt such practices as they will not do so the ai is safer in their case but what are the odds of most such people using the ai if not forced via legislation or simple consensus

825,it depends on the level of augmentation if you allow the driver to relax it can be a lot worse as they are no longer paying attention to the road this is why tesla now forces you to basically keep your hands on the wheel but safe driving demands constant attention ai assist could be helpful but more autonomy can mean unsafe driving until the tech is perfected
826,the logical solution would be to protect the vehicle and its occupants from injury if it prioritized saving the person running out in front then people would eventually just take to the assumption that this will happen every time and not take pedestrian safety so seriously and thus increase accidents over time its not just what happens in that moment its the statistical human behavior change that evolves from it

828,most manufacturing in the automotive industry is done by robots yknow the hidden parts of the car you probably wont even inspect let alone cant even see without taking half the car apart until something goes wrong robots built that you might as well already be screwed the moment you get behind the wheel since you dont actually have all the information on your car that you might need to properly drive and neither did the people who put it together in the end and yet you dont feel unsafe do you
829,whats the difference between being an airline passenger and a passenger in an autonomous car would you argue that airplanes should be less safe just so people can have more control
830,not following as i type this waymo has cars driving around arizona without safety drivers they just ordered k cars for their robot taxi service so it is happening

832,the issue with the uber fatality wasnt that the car didnt see the person it did but they had turned off the braking because the car breaks randomly otherwise so much for safer

834,we actually dont have to accept that this is just plain ignorant just get the code right that simple eh there are far too many variables to consider to wait until the code is perfect before we move forward in the mean time self driving cars will be a hell of a lot safer than human drivers

836,its kind of pointless to compare human vs automated safety records automated cars need to be significantly safer than human drivers or they will never see the light of day are there any other applications where people accept computers fucking up as much as humans improving accuracy and efficiency is why automation exists

839,so what youre saying is that itll become another manufacturing expense that gets passed along to the consumer insurance will still make their money gouging manufacturers and manufacturers will pass it along to the consumer with a bit of markup for their trouble what that means for the immediate future is that cars with autonomy features will be more expensive than they otherwise would as the roads adjust to having more autonomous vehicles and fewer humans and as autonomous vehicles get safer the rates insurance companies will have to charge to turn a profit will go down assuming regulators arent corrupted by the insurance lobby the amount they can charge the manufacturer will be capped and so the cost to the consumer will decrease commensurately basically itll have the same cost curve as a function of time as any other major technology thats inherently unsafe but also incredibly useful

843,german driver licensing is vastly more strictly than north american licensing or so ive heard as a canadian we barely need to know more than how to operate the machine as a german you need to know how to safely operate it again so say the rumors
844,yes but the purchase price is a known factor that you can take into account during your decision to buy the manufacturer should know the risk of the system they have built and so have a basis for how much that liability will be for the life of the vehicle but theres zero chance of any consumer being able to independently evaluate that liability before or after purchase in the manufacturer pays case if a manufacturer is liable and understates the risk then their insurance provider will charge them more or refuse to cover it the consumer might lose some of the value of their car because they get a poor reputation for safety but in all likelihood it will be in the manufacturers best interests to remedy the problem asap as well as the consumers in the customer pays case the customers are accepting an unknown and unknowable amount of liability when they purchase such a vehicle the insurance premium could go through the roof they could effectively be rendered uninsurable and the only incentive for the manufacturer to fix anything is bad press or if they are forced into a recall

846,im actually pretty optimistic about self driving being safer than the average human but like any new tech we need to make sure its properly regulated and like any business model we need to make sure liability and profit are in the right places in order for the market to function to the general good there will be cases where a self driving car will kill someone that an alert human driver would not there will hopefully be a lot more cases where a self driving system will avoid a fatal incident that a distracted driver would not the former will be easy to measure and should be properly investigated the latter we will only be able to understand statistically that doesnt mean that we should give more weight to the former but it does mean that we need to carefully and continuously weight the costs and benefits of using such automation when competing implementations exist we need to ensure that the most financially rewarding option for manufacturers is to continually improve safety not to pass liability to blameless consumers or hide behind hard to measure statistics placing the liability for such incidents squarely on manufacturers is the only way to adequately incentivise the behaviour that we want to see

849,i respect how dangerous driving is and how many people die from it its awful to think that there are people out there causing accidents for stupid reasons like texting and driving or whatever it may be on the other hand there are a lot of people out there who really love driving if everybody in the world thought driving was a chore self driving cars would be widely popular and probably already implemented everywhere people enjoy controlling their vehicles and enjoying the sense of freedom it brings ideally id like a self driving car that can be self driving when i want it to and lets me turn that off and drive myself but would take over control if i make a mistake that way people like me who love driving are happy that they can still enjoy that and cars will still be safer

851,the technology has not been proven to be more safe than an average driver all of the companies with self driving cars combined have not driven enough miles for an average driver to have had even a single fatal accident they have had multiple accidents most likely some of the companies like uber that have had a fatal accident are actually much less safe than a typical human driver
852,im just trying to make the same point that the highways safety people were making though the number seems arbitrary and id make it higher emph mine the head of the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa for example believes autonomous vehicles need to be twice as safe as human drivers before theyre allowed to roam the streets

854,noits not using human statistics shows us how awful we are on our own at driving given the fact most car accidents happen at the intersection shows how prone humans are to just following a green light and others ignoring a red light and automated cars are significantly safer we have to consider the fact that we are most concerned with the shittiest of drivers the people who drive drunk run red lights or fall asleep at the wheel computers in this scenario are fucking up way less than humans considering humans fucking drive drunk and kill people every day to say automated cars fuck up as much as humans is a joke

856,my thoughts exactly itd be ridiculous to hold the manufacturer fully accountable that would jack up the price of cars and thats unfair to people who go safer routes keep up on maintenance and pay attention in order to catch mistakes before they happen i dont want to pay for other peoples decisionslaziness it would however make sense to have manufacturers pay a small portion like in cases where its determined if possible that the self driving technology was at fault that would encourage them to continue working to make the tech safer

862,i think this is over played its hard to base a safety case upon sensors extrinsic to the vehicle because its difficult to verify data integrity in any case the vehicle must be safe in isolation eg it must pass an elk test in fog at night either by seeing through the fog or driving within the limits of its sensors intra vehicle data cannot replace conventional signals because human drivers are still legal at eis so the manoeuvre cadence cant increase vehicle manufacturers have little incentive to share data because if eg fords cooperate with fords then network effects will favour big players freeze out disruptive new entrants legislation may therefore be required to force sharing however integrity is harder if the standard is open this sort of distributed asynchronous system is really hard to police no i dont think blockchain is the solution i suppose it could be done with public key cryptography a really big database of vins but then integrity verification would depend on internet access which might not be dependable eg in tunnels or remote areas i therefore think it will be limited to more controlled environments like road trains controlled by single operators or non safety critical uses better traffic data for strategic routing decisions as distinct from tactical manoeuvre decisions

864,british roads are pretty fucking safe driving standard is generally great and road signage is amazing
865,first of all the average us driver has one accident roughly every miles in google announced that its self driving cars had done miles in a wide range of conditions without an accident but more to the point the technology has improved over time and is still being improved its gotten safer and safer with each passing year

869,exactly and they have a shit ton of fail safes and thats what the autonomous cars will be like
870,and that number is smaller than the average number of crashes per mile driven in the us that just means that their car is safer than the average driver but average driver includes people who drive drunk high aggressive and just plain stupid teslas car is probably not safer than a really safe driver which is why its still in development

873,youre still going to need safe distances youre not always going to have perfect traction and a couple inches of separation wont cut it there
874,when they can drive in unplowed snow safely and deal with road work ill think about it right now i feel like people need to be ready to jump in at any second but thats not how people will use them its like the uber car that hit the pedestrian driver is fussing around letting car drive not ready when car fails
875,im a bad driver id buy a self driving car for the safety of others around me my spacial perception is just really bad

877,it is indeed still a capacity issue but keep in mind that near optimally driving ai driven cars would multiply the capacity of existing road infrastructure you could have highways with everyone safely tailgating everybody else for example i agree that making traffic more efficient is treating symptoms instead of curing the disease bad city planning
878,what are you talking about who said justice who said vengeance it is the justice system with judges and chief justices but from your wording it seems nobody is at fault or ceos of computer programmers get immunity against this people go to jail for insider trading building a business and cutting corners on safety resulting in somebody being killed seems way worse to me

880,maybe but there arent many really safe drivers around and they still get in accidents
881,not necessarily the most efficientsafest the most efficient may be the emergent behaviour of multiple independent actors in fact its highly likely given everything we know about economics and group behaviour in other species the no arbitrage no free lunch principal depends on there being multiple independent actors and would be very hard to replicate centrally
882,people are always so fast to dismiss ideas on the grounds of i dont want a self driving car doing mph in a rural environment at night in winter in fog with my lights switched off its not going to be like that on day one phase one could be motorwayinterstate roads fast wide safe roads with every car going the same direction at effectively the same speed phase two could be years later following multiple software revisions hardware upgrades and improved safety records phase two could be urban roads limited speeds with both onboard and roadside sensors and monitoring phase three could be even more years later rural roads with even more software and hardware improvements realtime satellite updates of dangers unseen etc etc by the time we get to phase iii itll be so commonplace to allow autodriven cars on the fastest roads that my hope is that we will have stopped allowing the evolved chimpanzees to drive themselves on the major roads

888,you couldnt have highways of people safely tailgating each other the first deer to come along would result in thousand car pileups ai doesnt magically change the physics of tires and brakes distances would be shorter but still limited by the physics of stopping distances
889,uber are desperately attempting to catch up with waymo in the autonomous vehicle scene the pilot intervention statistic in that article is from them not waymo or other platforms which have statistically have far fewer cases of intervention the biggest failure with the uber fatality is allowing the platform on public roads without adequate government scrutiny more reputable companies may have pushed for those laws but in the end it is up to law makers to ensure the safety of public roads not to dismiss uber are absolutely to blame as well telsa auto pilot also is basically glorified lane assist and shouldnt be included when considering the safety of proper autonomous vehicles with lidar systems which at the moment are essential so for competent companies with proper systems the fatality rate is zero and from my knowledge the number of accidents where the self driving vehicle is at fault is zero or in the single digits this technology is already proven it is on the near horizon and will radically change the world making millions of jobs obsolete we should be planning for that outcome not scoffing its inevitability

891,lol nah yeah should have put only one pedestrian however they still are far safer than human drivers and the technology hasnt even been perfected yet lemme ask you though that subset of the population that can only afford to get to work in their dollar beater we kill those people right or do you have some magical thinking ubi bullshit that miracles that problem away too uhhh no itll take a bit for them to become mainstream but once it is we can just have services where you order a self driving car from your phone kind of like an automated uber and if you want to buy a car theyll be the only thing available theyll end up being affordable and actually carry far lower insurance premiums of course most jobs are going to be automated out of existence and well start feeling more and more of the pressure when these come out especially since theyll kill a lot of transport industry jobs ubi or some other program is going to be necessary when most people are out of work

893,you dont need to eliminate accidents though you need to make them safer than humans i think what we will see is more and more self driving features a human will be required but the advanced cruise control features are going to get even more advanced than they currently are go test drive a new audi a and see how it goes its amazing

895,in my country we place fences along the highway in forested areas periodically there will be a bridge covered in shrubs and trees crossing the highway the fences lead animals to the bridges and they cross there safely
896,going to be hell on deer then although ive been saying those fucks should wear reflective safety vests for years

898,nah i understand the concept of a zipper merge although i didnt know thats what it was called and i have no problem with people waiting until the lane is ending to merge it was really more the fact that he waited until the lane started to end and then stomped on the gas and tried to pass half a dozen cars and merge in front of them and then acted like they were the assholes for not slamming on their brakes to let him in had he just kept speed he would have ended up in front of me and i was already slowing down to let him merge when he decided to speed up and try to pass as many people as possible but also the fact that he saw every single car other than himself get in the right lane and still decided to stay in the left if you see every car but yourself get in the lane that isnt ending its probably going to be safer to take any opening you can prior to the lane ending instead of waiting until the last second and trying to squeeze in edit also my wording was kind of bad of us didnt go from the left lane to the right lane we were kind of evenly distributed between the two lanes and then those of us in the left lane just moved into the open spaces in the right lane as the lane was about to close

902,so dont get me wrong self driving cars will be significantly safer than human drivers deaths a year in the us so even if it reduces by half that is deaths per day that is a lot of legal work and reviewing of software to prevent recalls i wouldnt know of any software engineer who would be into working on updates for recalls because the rate of deaths from your self driving company is higher than your competitors the non stop requests to go speak to congress to plead your case in why they dont shut your company down how many is enough of a reduction in deaths to not become an issue is a day below the threshold to continue to not have to fix the issues with the software is okay the good thing about people driving is that the responsibility is fully on the human driver they are worse by the responsibility is distributed across the entire driving population it isnt the responsibility of a couple of companies its these problems that mean self driving cars wont be legal in our lifetimes

904,thats because its meant to be done when traffic is going slower than normal anyways taken from those articles it states just that first one when not to do the zipper merge when traffic is moving at highway speeds and there are no backups it makes sense to move sooner to the lane that will remain open through construction the bottom line is to merge when it is safe to do so second one if roads are clear enough that everyone is already driving close to the speed limit zipper merging isnt as effective
905,in what way i dont think i said anything particularly controversial i thought you might even agree with me on the need for better regulation of this type of technology i think we both agree that allowing potentially dangerous vehicles on the road is unacceptable but the question is what happens when they are demonstrably more safe than human drivers
906,where did i say i was better lol indeed am very safe driver people are already so dependant on assisted steering etc i drive a manual toyota pickup with bald tires and drive better than a lot of the newbs i see new trucks in ditches every time it snows and my is just fine even with no sandbags its sketchy af if you dont know what youre doing you will spin out but im very tender with her anyway i dont trust the automatic cars yet just wait til a school bus or something gets rammed also im not the entire country of the us and drive waaaaaay better than most
907,that goes against the assumption we made in the beginning that the cars are safe than normal drivers if the chances of you getting in an accident are drastically reduced then you cant say it was programmed negligently
908,integrated thats an interesting way of saying on actual roads with people around they already have i meant not in full public use thats kind of the idea isnt it the point is that theyre already pretty safe we have a pretty good idea
909,computer programmer here city driving is exponentially more difficult than highway itll hit long haul trucking first as they implement hub to hub routes plus its simpler legally to allow them on interstates than just anywhere theyll still need people to drive from the hubs to the final destinations i think youre safe that cdlsll be in demand for at least years but beyond that it gets murky certainly it wont be all autonomous by then but even some changes the demand for drivers and can price you out if you feel the call of the open road then i think its fine to ride the wave while the surfs up even if you know youll have to jump ship eventually but i also understand not wanting to pursue a career path that may eventually be a dead end
910,a thing to take note of is that most self driving marketing has focused on consumer vehicles i cant recall a single ounce of hype regarding commercial trucking despite it being a gold mine for self driving technology and having relatively simpler use cases further you may note that most self driving demonstrations are in highly controlled environments the technology is just too limited at the moment so id wager five to ten years until you see general application for just average drivers regarding trucking theres likely never going to be a point where you have no driver involved not that the technology wont be able to replace but because the risk factor is too large ai applications invariably have a margin of uncertainty its just how the world works when youre talking about the scale of how far commercial trucking must travel and the economic cost of a damaged shipment not to mention the collateral of a truck crashing into something its just more economic to hire a driver as a failsafe there will likely be pay cuts since you become a glorified babysitter but it doesnt make sense to me to simply eliminate the profession
911,i think well see major automation specifically for warehouse to warehouse or dock to warehouse shipping where the vast majority of the traffic and navigation will be on highways local pickups and deliveries arent going to be as easy to automate through every local circumstance so those jobs should be safer for longer

913,how far along are self driving cars they are safer cheaper in the long run assuming enough are made to make up for development costs and more reliable than human drivers should i be worried for my future as a truck driver no politicians dont care as much about something being safer than human drivers as they do about allowing this would make truck drivers vote for the other guy after all people that die in traffic accidents can no longer vote or but even if ten times fewer traffic accidents happen ill get blamed for those ones

915,im lucky to be really fanatical about dieting and lifestyle i fasted for hours a day last week as part of an intermittant fasting diet i plan to supplement it with vitamins to meet my daily needs in the future and work life balance is important but there comes a point where being poor having no money having no insurance or stability starts to harm you more than slaving away but being safe would but i understand perfectionism and being a workaholic is something i have struggled with in the past and im well aware of it
916,xb mid thirties single with k usd in cash no house no debt my physician career too stressful do i just push on for more yrs do i start over and retrain as software engineer my childhood dream no you do not push on for years hopefully if you are a decent physician you understand the negative effects of mental stress and daily unhappiness many people have changed careers much later in life than mid s xb could i smartly invest large chunk in cryptostock to make money and do low paid job crypto seems like an unreasonable risk to me there are much safer reliable and predictable investment options you can discuss this in rpersonalfinance

918,id like to see how your career change unfolds ive found your post while looking for career options for myself im also a physician in my thirties im considering codingprogramming as a strong possibility because i like it wouldnt mind studying it and working on some valueable certification i assume its something that could be done part time and remotely so i wouldnt have to quit my job until i could do so safely i assume its a field where you could get a job without a degree and learn as you go i assume i in my thirties and no prior experience have a fair chance of getting employed abroad to work remotely so even a low paid job is worthy because of exchange rates id like to hear your thoughts on these assumptionsoverall plan do you guys think its feasible its just a wild dream because someone on my position would find it extremely difficult to get employed in the area
919,the difference between a mechanical failure and an ai failure is difficult to understand i had a mechanical failure just before christmas where my breaks couldnt be pushed down and therefor couldnt stop but because this is a troubling issue that does happen there are other mechanical solutions built into the vehicle i was able to safely stop my car before anything horrible happened because of this ai is a whole different situation and its hard to predict since we dont know how the programming is going to look like in its final version these self driving cars are going to be making choices without our own input just the input of whoever programmed it do you stop or swerve for an animal does that decision change if someone is behind in front or in another lane would that choice be the same for a human instead of an animal in the road if there isnt time to stop and multiple things are in the road what do you hit do you hit a pedestrian or risk killing the driver and passengers how are these choices made who is at legal fault for anything that happens its wayyyy more than just what if x fails and its instead about a lot of difficult moral choices we as humans make these choices based on so many things in a split second an ai is trained to make these choices even if it goes against our own morals what if the self driving car was coded to kill men over women pedestrians over the driver elderly over children what if its trained to not stop for j walkers since theyre breaking the law what if it isnt trained to avoid a bird or small animal in the road there are so many what ifs so many situations so many potential situations that could be missed and not programmed and if it does something you disagree with on a fundamental level how do you live with that if theres knowledge that the car might choose to kill you in an emergency would you still buy the car
920,cars depend on computers and sensors you as a human can recognize when something is wrong and correct it a small failure not accounted for with failsafes redundancy or in the program can go very wrong if it fails to recognize a obstacle it will run into it we have not been convinced they will be able to work inside all conditions or humans wearing any clothing
921,if i press the brake pedal and nothing happens i may attempt to steer off the road if there is a safe place to do so i may engage the emergency brake i may put the car in park for non drivers this last option would do extensive damage to the transmission and require a costly repair it would be a last ditch effort to avoid a fatality at this point in time i have not achieved any sort of comfort level with how a self driving car would evaluate those options we continue using cars because some of us really dont have reasonable alternatives to conduct our necessary business
922,in a bus or any vehicle where you pay money the persons goal is to keep everyone paying safe including themselves because they can die in one where you dont pay then that person is probably your friendfamily and is trying to keep you safe as well we themselves plus a friendfamily member is going to hold many of the same morals as you do and make many of the same choices this moral aspect is part of the reason why people say a bus taxi uber etc is more dangerous the different and unknown morals makes the drive unknown and therefor a bigger danger in several aspects aside from morals a self driving car doesnt have a will to live as it has no instincts and cant live or die so it is only driven by programming not by trying to survive like a human driver
923,safety driver also humps paperwork to the office yes in the st century when youd think drivers could just text a qr code and get all the drop off and pickup info they needed paperwork has to be humped does the twice a day vehicle inspections as well as setting and updating route in case of detour or something

925,i guess what im getting at is that the union will make it difficult to get to a cab less truck a great example is an old segment with tucker carlson and ben shapiro that i cant be bothered to find a link for at the moment carlson amongst his many other negative character traits demonstrates that hes an anti progress statist that would advocate against autonomous trucks regardless of the net positive to society and safety due to the impact it would have on trucking jobs he goes on to say that if it were up to him he would manufacture concerns about safety and infrastructure in order to undermine autonomys adoption while carlson is a shit lord this will absolutely be the truckers union playbook once autonomy becomes viable

927,im perfectly aware i used to work at an sdc company but when theres a safety driver theyre there for well safety not for liability if a company was at the point where all they cared about was liability they would pay for an insurance policy which would be much cheaper than hiring a driver the whole point of deploying self driving cars commercially is to save money

929,the most impressive thing was honestly the parking lot it seems like the most complicated and unpredictable environment it handled in some sense its the least likely environment for someone to get hurt but easily most likely place for a fender bender overall its a small geo fenced area and they are avoiding highways but this is real progress theyll be measuring miles with out safety drivers in the millions real soon interested based on this where do folks think they are likely to be in a year or two im trying to update my priors

939,theyve been working on it with safety drivers for sure the thing is in phoenix distances are often far you want that mile commute at or with traffic and stop lights make that a mile ride and youd get really unhappy on the milk run and that was my point in phoenix a mile commute is common so even to do the rest of phoenix that needs to be viable

948,keep in mind that safety driver in waymos world means people driving the car not one so they reduce to one big deal its still not driverless
949,keep in mind though that compared to usual there will be wayyyyy fewer cars on the roads either way so even if you only see as many waymos as usual that doesnt really tell you that of them were completely driverless and had safety drivers

953,if anything it would be hurtful give the passengers a false sense of safety maybe if they had the car return to the depot after each ride to wipe down it would be better

955,they can serve the community make the case for automation and make the public case they are safe they can just pile on the fully autonomous miles while it wont improve the driving it can be a useful test for scaling up actual driverless operations testing remote software testing running hundreds of cars without drivers etc
956,i mean this is literally the perfect use for it too go out get drunk robot drives you home safely
957,the deserted cross roads googlmapsafekxqbrvvknepa where he pans around is pretty much just used for the school out and park the two main roads mcclintock and chandler blvd they take do get busy but i guess it was quiet over the weekend
958,video description weve been early adopters for the last couple years but this was the first time there was truly no safety driver
959,video description weve been early adopters for the last couple years but this was the first time there was truly no safety driver
960,maybe i should clarify that by confidence i mean reliability probability that an accident will happen without safety driver every mile or million miles as you can see clearly in all these tesla videos they cannot go millions of miles without touching the wheel disengaging autopilot this is what is necessary for actual self driving
961,maybe i should clarify that by confidence i mean reliability probability that an accident will happen without safety driver every mile or million miles as you can see clearly in all these tesla videos they cannot go millions of miles without touching the wheel disengaging autopilot this is what is necessary for actual self driving
962,but it depends entirely on what you want them to demonstrate shared a video of what i like to see a tesla capable of it does not have to do everything in the video but something even in the ball park vflihmrewq so you think a tesla can demo something in the ball park within months it would require tesla drastically improving what they have today personally see zero chance of that happening i do not believe tesla will be able to accomplish even within years id be shocked if the lidar approach ends up reaching level self driving before computer vision really odd statement lidar is addition not subtraction but i also do not believe we will see level in the next decade personally think there is zero chance that is going to happen has nothing to do with lidar level is also not necessary and is always going to be less safe than level
963,but as i said its completely irrelevant if theres a driver in the seat or not all that matters is interventions and when tesla finds it safe enough to do away with a driver is not the same time that jurisdictions will allow it and yes i think tesla will deem it safe enough in a couple of years but to demonstrate that you can go through phoenix without interventions will not depend on whether theres a driver in the seat or not and i absolutely expect that next year
964,well if nothing else well get our first real data on how safe these vehicles actually are albeit in limited scenarios it will be interesting to see if they report how frequently their mission control or whatever its called has to intervene as well exciting times
965,i am super excited for sdcs from a technological and general convenience standpoint i am an engineer so i love the tech and of the time i would not mind having my car drive itself while i nap or work or whatever the only thing that gives me pause however is that sometimes i use my car in ways that i dont think sdcs will easily support sometimes i like to take the long way home just to unwind and see the scenery sometimes i just drive to the park during lunch and take a nap in my seat sometimes i sit for longer than necessary in the walmart parking lot in order to catch up on texts sometimes i pull a sudden u turn because i saw something interesting i still support the development because safety trumps all of these little conveniences but still im a little sad to potentially lose that kind of freedom

967,i dont know man maybe i agree routing will need to be flexible but i think well for sure lose some freedom pulling a random u y it just wont be as easy so it probably wont happen its the difference between saying i want to go that way and simply turning the wheel versus i want to go that way take out my phone pull up the app cancel current route confirm cancellation somehow draw out the new route pay fine for additional time in car etc im probably exaggerating the process but only to make the point dont get me wrong im still excited and want sdcs but i think we have to be honest with ourselves and recognize that well likely lose some ease and freedom of travel i dont see any way short of reading my mind that using a constantly monitored and controlled sdc will ever be as free as your own hands on the wheel but the trade off will be safer cheaper travel with big brother always watching and given that plus percent of the time im just going from a to b ill make that trade

969,not at all and yet in the example youve given it seems trivial for a human who can fully devote his attention to tracking a subject and giving voice commands to the vehicle can be more effective and much safer also while it may be a matter of semantics its possible for a vehicle to be self driven and still have a joystick or other interface for granular human control while the vehicle itself actual retains control and ensures safety because this conversation started by someone suggesting that manual driving would cease to exist entirely you didnt answer the question why do motorcycles need to exist lots of technology comes and goes as new technology takes over

972,its possible for a vehicle to be self driven and still have a joystick or other interface for granular human control while the vehicle itself actual retains control and ensures safety no that is no longer autonomous why do motorcycles need to exist i didnt realize you were suggesting banning them how about this motorcycles need to exist becausewe have this thing called freedom where things arent outlawed just because they dont conveniently fit into your idea of how thing should be sdcs are supposed to give us more freedom not less and if your only solution to problems is to take away existing options you really dont deserve a place in the conversation

980,nah bikes arent going to be self driving or need laser range finders theyre just talking about having more information about what the cyclist is doing or going to do so for example if you turn the front wheel the car will want to know that so it can predict which direction youre going to go and if you begin to slow down the car whose sensor might not be as sensitive might want to know this in advance and both of these functions could be accomplished with a small device you stick on the handlebars which has an accelerometer and gyroscope in it like your phone in fact your phone could perform the function with an app and they already sell cell handlebar mounts for cellphones finally this could be optional an additional safety feature like a helmet im sure the cars wont require this information to drive around you but being able to predict your movement will increase safety if you suddenly decide to cut left across traffic for whatever reason for a child this could be a life safer and all you need to do is stick that little solar or usb powered thingy on there and theyre good to go could even integrate the bell and a headlamp into it

995,my bad i get it youre looking for more info i figured it was just easy to clarify as the same sort of thing exist swhere i live so i just connected the dots the city is just trying to reduce traffic on certain streets for safety reasons usually and the waymo cars i inferred are set to comply and just stay right out of those areas if they dont actually require access theyre not car free zones just attempts to discourage use as thoroughfares

1015,the trolly problem has no basis autonomous cars do not evaluate based on age quantity or pop morality they simply sense something exists then attempts to avoid sharing physical space with the detected obstacle the cold reality is that none are ready for primetime nor will they be without significant computing advancements so the stupidity of the average driver is safe for a very long time
1016,if self driving cars achieve an equal or better safety record than the average human then no i dont see why the occupants of a self driving car should be prepared to assume control any more than train passengers are people get killed every day on the roads but we consider that an acceptable risk due to the relative infrequency and benefit to society that cars provide self driving vehicles are no different in fact humans do a pretty shitty job of driving on average so from an ethical standpoint we should feel compelled to get them out of the driving seat crashstatsnhtsadotgovapipublicviewpublication

1021,not sure if they are safer even in highways
1022,traffic is overwhelmingly caused by poor drivers its due to people not leaving enough space ahead of them to only slow down instead of stop and go in a jam because humans are very inefficient at stopping and going there is a natural delay that gets multiplied by each car in the jam they start because people dont drive safely and give themselves enough space in front of them which is exacerbated by merging or lane switching drivers to get in their lane without slamming on the brakes if people drove better and left enough room ahead of them to buffer out those stop and gos or merges throughput and speeds on roads would increase dramatically and jams would clear up rather than lasting for hours after the issue is gone

1045,i didnt read it either lmao but i have seen the statistics before tesla has them on their site for q it says on autopilot there was a crash every million miles driven human input with safety features on there was a crash every million miles and the average non tesla has a crash every miles looking at these again trying to find bias though id imagine a large percentage of autopilot miles driven are highway miles and the majority of crashes occur off the highway so its hard to compare the two trying to find a statistic for average crashes per mile specifically for highway miles driven but no luck currently also not sure how they define crash

1053,thats something of a correlation though it doesnt necessarily prove anything every person is a little different and every car is a little different do you have a specific source of statistics you can quote while being less reckless than a bad driver or safer than the average driver is good is it better than a relatively good driver or the peak performance of an individual in any case self driving cars arent the only solution that might increase safety having more viable mass transit would help and so would fewer drivers ie a lower ratio of cars to people plus id bet money that impatience stress sleep deprivation etc contribute significantly to accidents and reckless driving problems

1056,of course not i suppose you could argue ai in addition to human drivers is good those statistics are available too and are also significantly better than regular human drivers i would just think weve been perfecting safety features for decades and robot driving is just a baby in terms of development this is obviously just speculation at this point but i imagine in another decade well come a long way in that department

1058,since when do regulators need an excuse if it can affect the safe operation of tens of thousands of vehicles there need to be rules in place to ensure changes are safe before deployment if tesla cant produce and adhere to those rules themselves then its in the power of the state of federal government to step in and insist they do so
1059,besides the public bias against self driving the relevant question we should all ask ourselves is how the safety compares to other cars

1066,upon confirming the full self driving rollback musk said occasional issues are to be expected with beta software which is intended to be tested in a variety of conditions to iron out problems nah its cool man its still in beta s apparently costs to be a tester full self driving is the latest iteration of the companys software now in the hands of roughly drivers who paid as much as to upgrade and received early access or passed a safety screening

1070,this is why it is rolled out to the top rated drivers before anyone else that is the testing phase and where it was caught drivers at this level have complete control over the vehicle at all time and are able to quickly take over if the ai does something strange if you have an issue with their test make sure you at least know how they test tesla self driving mode as it sits safer than your average driver

1074,arent safer on autopilot so researchers calling for driver monitoring may be right
1075,arent safer on autopilot so researchers calling for driver monitoring may be right
1076,seriously it was really not a big deal it drove great to the park on the way back i had to turn off fsdap and forward collision warnings and drive home like a muggle so i was just as unsafe as everybody else that trip and it was literally fixed before i got home
1077,there is not faa like verification process which auto manufacturers have to go through to demonstrate the safety and engineering robustness of their software systems and the automotive software today is more complex than the aviation autopilot systems combined with tesla flagrant denial of the predictable abuse issue which we know exists and we have a major problem with safety

1079,but are anecdotes data of the m miles between accidents in manual mode would be on freeway and m off of it for the m miles in autopilot m would be on freeway and just off of it so the manual record is roughly one accident per m miles off freeway and per m miles on freeway but the autopilot record ballparks to m miles between accidents off freeway and m on freeway in other words about longer without an accident in manual with forward collision avoidance on or tacc than in autopilot instead of being safer with autopilot it looks like a tesla is slightly less safe if i am testing the fsd beta i will probably be paying more attention than i would be actually driving myself its going to make driving so much more fun we know from decades of research that this is not true

1081,so many people in this thread complaining about autopilot that have never used it its like if we got road policy advice from a bunch of teenagers with learners permits if regulators want to learn how the system performs they should ask the people who use it or just follow the statistics which show that using autopilot with human oversight is substantially safer than driving manually

1083,but this technology is saving lives already but its also costing lives not to mention research showing autopilot is not any safer fsd only appears to be even more dangerous its called the step in problem and humans are just bad at it not to mention the predictable abuse issues other automakers actually tried to solve while tesla dug in its heels

1092,it doesnt really matter that these are special beta testers i mean thats better than random people but the problem is that these are still people on the road these people may be working beta testers but by extension theyre making everyone else on the road inadvertent beta testers the fact that you have actual real safety concerns here raises the bar for what should be considered the readiness level of an update normal beta testing is done to help weed out and find any lingering bugs you go in with the assumption that bugs exist and youre trying to address them before full release in this instance beta should be the final test to make sure there are no existing bugs if you find one that should be cause for serious concern because it means your other safeguards failed it should be seen as unacceptable and should be cause for interval review

1094,testing in prod is not really testing more of a trial and error drivers even super safe drivers dont know what to expect from a car like sudden stops on a highway also other drivers driving along a tesla should not be forced to participate in this beta stuff
1095,safety critical systems shouldnt be beta tested on the public at all let alone having your customers pay for the privilege of assuming that risk never mind that software this buggy shouldnt have even made it out of integration testing

1097,you cant just roll out unsafe cars and say its fine its just in beta thats fine for a video game but cars can kill people theyre regulated just a bit stricter
1098,so the article is incorrect administration and issued an official recall notice detailing the problem which affected as many as nearly vehicles even if its only a handful of beta testers if theyre going to be on the public roads doesnt that fall into the same safety issue maybe tesla tested it thoroughly in a closed environment then rolled it out to a couple of beta testers caught the problem before it was rolled out to thousands of vehicles and everything worked perfectly shouldnt an external auditor make sure that the entire processes safe and is actually being followed

1100,how is that apples to oranges its the entire purpose of developing the tech if the technology is made to improve the safety of driving and doesnt its a problem if the data shows it does then maybe it should be encouraged if you are replacing something a driver with something else a driverless vehicle then it warrants a comparison doesnt it

1102,company has k out of its million cars beta testing software you have to opt into the program and have to be a proven safe driver there was a bug in the software and it was corrected within min
1103,they want the cars to drive by themselves the company is assuring us that the software is safe and they shouldnt need to have any outside testing done on it were supposed to just allow them to download updates which may or may not release the cars upon our roadways like a menace the company says its safe and that were supposed to trust them when the cars suddenly start slamming on the breaks in the middle of the highway they just say oops that was a bad update the company doesnt want any oversight or regulation about this they want to be able to test and then implement anything they want without any supervision or input from anyone its crazy to allow them to do this
1104,the problem is that you cant really train an ai like this by playing it safe if all it is trained on is private roads where nothing ever goes wrong then it will fail the first time it encounters something outside of spec technological progress has always required breaking a few eggs if you want to make an omelet
1105,these folks just keep spewing unfounded marketing statements as if its fact i honk theyve watched too many ted videos of the m miles between accidents in manual mode would be on freeway and m off of it for the m miles in autopilot m would be on freeway and just off of it so the manual record is roughly one accident per m miles off freeway and per m miles on freeway but the autopilot record ballparks to m miles between accidents off freeway and m on freeway in other words about longer without an accident in manual with forward collision avoidance on or tacc than in autopilot instead of being safer with autopilot it looks like a tesla is slightly less safe

1109,i think tesla has a poor model and misleads very often on how effective their systems are where does tesla mislead on this do you have any examples of tesla claiming they have it solved on the current build or that the rider can sit back and not pay attention of course you dont the media invented a story about fsd being sold as a completed and safe thing and people parrot that back also people hear tesla talk about how their current system is good enough to lead to a driverless future and they arent smart enough to know what that means so they assume it means their current build is a robotaxi
1110,would you rather be on the road with a properly licensed regulated responsible driver who is not just half assed tested once in his entire life back in the teen years and in a society where we dont pressure people into driving when tired and give people ample cheap public transportation and remove unfair stigmas against it so they can use alternate transportation when needed or let technology we dont even trust to run our dumb little phones correctly do something as important and mission critical as drive a car something that not only can potentially endanger the passenger but people in other cars and property around them regulation and change has to happen technology isnt the solution to everything since technology isnt perfect and can potentially be far more dangerous than a distracted driver our over reliance on technology has gotten us into a world full of anti privacy and anti freedom as well as so many other things that has dehumanized us to a point where we are essentially a slave to it technology has to be a tool not a means to an end we cannot allow automated driving to exist as it would cause so many more issues than it would solve as well as further erode privacy and freedom yes humans driving are problematic but solving that issue by doing common sense things to help our society eliminate a large number of these problems is a far better solution than further enslaving ourselves to repressive big brother technology im a lifelong sysadmin and programmer ask anyone like me and theyll say the same dont let technology run our lives its not anti technology its anti control and technology isnt reliable or secure enough in any situation to allow it bugs and hacks will happen and theres no way to safeguard it
1111,i dont have to imagine the scenario because i see it all the time its extremely unsettling when the oncoming driver occupant responsible for safe operation of the vehicle isnt paying one bit of attention makes me want to hang up the helmet and participate in the arms race of trucks where bigger better just to survive my commute
1112,youve heard of safety engineering but have you heard of hazard engineering its the way of the future
1113,youve heard of safety engineering but have you heard of hazard engineering its the way of the future
1114,exactly literally every other car company well lets put rivian and the other tech focused startups aside actually has to make their cars safe at risk of being sued into oblivion so why and how tesla is allowed to conduct glorified alpha testing on public roads is astounding to me i really hope they get reigned in and soon because what theyre doing right now is beyond irresponsible its likely going to cost lives before we know it
1115,seriously i mean even excluding safety and just looking at build quality they have panel gaps because theyre still working out the kinks theyre a tech company working out how to make cars which is way harder than the other companies doing the opposite the panel gaps are still nowhere near acceptable for what you pay the door jambs arent painted because its a cost saving measure and for less waste if they can do it on a k polo they can afford to do it on your k model y or at least not make it look so shitty stop making excuses because you wanna ride elon more than your tesla

1117,theyre not wrong the easiest way to progress quickly is to move fast and break things thats fine when you accidentally break peoples access for a few hours to large scale knowledge database that has only existed for the last years or so thats not fine when the things you are breaking are users bones bodies and lives tesla takes the attitude of software design sometimes all that said tesla actually does a lot of heavy testing and checks the problem of being at the edge is that theres edge cases that only happen of the time and its really hard to fix remember when toyotas modification of accelerators and mats resulted in a huge amount of accidents to pay million in crash settlement mats still to blame it took over years since the issue was identified and toyota would still deny the obvious teslas engineering is top notch and their cars have had less security issues and better fixes than their competitors throughout the years blame the culture and management but the engineering is top notch human and sometimes making mistakes but as good quality as any other car maker as a matter of fact that will be the problem that self driving cars will have there will be errors and failures that will result in deaths but even if self driving cars do only slightly better than the average youd have to go to tens of thousands of deaths before it wouldnt still be a better idea than not doing it but people dont see it like that its the airplane fallacy someone would rather go drive cross country out of fear of dying on an airplane crash when in reality the moment they have the highest chance of dying on a flight is on the drive to and back from the airport a cross country trip is incredibly dangerous in comparison but because seeing someone die being run over or due to a car crash is an every day occurrence no one really talks about and we dont think but airplane crashes are so rare we obsess over them the safer car gets the more national news a car crash will be in this specific case though musk shot himself on the foot imho had he been less combative this wouldnt have escalated into an issue that is national news the tech is not at a point thats ready to ask for regulation revisits and offering more freedom on it while it may be mature enough that this would be beneficial we really dont have enough data even if tesla is doing it right its not easy to imagine what regulations must be set someone else could come with their cheap version that screws everyone and sets back the regulatory evolution of self driving cars a decade there is such a thing as too soon

1119,theres joy in being an early adopter and eas are who help push a lot of tech forward that said self driving cars are not an area where this level of risk to others is an acceptable tradeoff for advancement and tesla has shown they cannot be trusted to deliver safe products without strict regulatory oversight
1120,reason you have to pay attention is the self driving relies on a computer algorithm based on reinforcement learning the more data they can collect the better it will become but they have to collect that data somehow its like the idea of learning algebra if you came from an understanding of basic math learning algebra isnt too hard but if youre trying to jump from elementary school math straight into algebra youre going to be lost right now theyre trying to teach something that has never understood driving to drive so you can think of the people using the software as teachers and the more time they put into learning the better it can be but without them the right at which itll improve will be dramatically slower so in order for this sort of technology to take off and to be safe it requires a lot of training because how can it expect something like a pedestrian jumping into the road or an animal darting across or even another car swerving in front of you these are all very rare situations that may never happen to most people
1121,driving at a speed such that you can easily stop when the light turns yellow is safety unexpected hard braking and hard braking in general indicates you were driving too fast and may result in people rear ending you

1123,safety critical systems shouldnt be beta tested on the public at all then how should tesla gather training data for their neural network
1124,safety critical systems shouldnt be beta tested on the public at all then how should tesla gather training data for their neural network
1125,apples to apples this would be like boeing installing some software they tested in simulated hardware into beta planes out of airplanes in service and then when they noticed the beta planes were braking erroneously during pre flight checks and they were getting altitude warnings while still on the ground they rolled the software on the beta planes back to the previous version this is what caused the rollback to occur on the beta tesla vehicles false collision warnings and unnecessary auto emergency braking events might occur translated out if a beta car had someone tailgating at speed and there was a false collision warning then there might be an emergency braking event and that might lead to an accident due to the human driver following closer than is safe not quite the headline news event is it
1126,im not aware of any crash happening as a result of that update its more like if boeing finds a safety issue in a line of parts they made for s and recalls those parts
1127,im not aware of any crash happening as a result of that update its more like if boeing finds a safety issue in a line of parts they made for s and recalls those parts
1128,youre correct they have to beta test the software before its rolled out tesla beta tested this software saw feedback from the beta test that there were false collision warnings even a couple is plenty and because that could lead to unwanted emergency braking they had to roll back the beta tester cars to a stable release the headline should read tesla doing a good job of playing it safe with beta testing vehicles
1129,i only see anti tesla bias and a pro safety bias where is the anti automated driving
1130,i only see anti tesla bias and a pro safety bias where is the anti automated driving
1131,why teslas entire comparison on why their cars are safer doesnt actually show their cars are safer theyre using a sly apples to oranges comparison that doesnt make sense

1137,did you sign up for teslas beta test youre not listening just persistent in seeing this from one view this is about public safety first technological progress has always required breaking a few eggs if you want to make an omelet this is such a sociopathic statement those broken eggs are human beings do you know how many inhumane scientific experiments have been conducted with this inhumane justification even if we as a society decide to embark on this journey its not at teslas sole discretion

1139,it doesnt it requires monitoring it encourages supervision and oversight when im using ap im using a small amount of mental energy on monitoring the car behavior and actually find myself spending more time monitoring other traffic and the situation really no different than when i fly using autopilot you eliminate menial work tasks and spend more time on higher order stuff which ultimately improves safety we cant forget that shitty distracted drivers always exist autopilot doesnt make someone a shitty distracted driver

1141,the article discusses a version of software that was live from about am to am for about thousand people one sunday morning before being rolled back i was one of those people and drove for about miles during that time and had no issues yes its a problem when any vehicle drives unsafely but we dont know what of the k were affected only that some users reported issues this was also software labeled as beta that users had to go through up to a month of proving they were safe drivers to gain access to and had to sign off on the potential risks and are being monitored for attentiveness by the internal cabin camera they kick you out of the program if you are not looking at the road i really dont know how much more safely you can develop such a program
1142,i am under no impression that fsd is perfect or even good but the bar is pretty low for exceeding human capability lets do some quick math the fatality rate for human drivers is deaths per million miles traveled statisticsdetailstate by state tesla has about million cars with autopilot on the road cleantechnicacomover tesla vehicles with autopilot on the road the average driver drives miles per week cut our driving in half is it time for pay per mile insurance shbadaad so telsa drivers alone are collectively averaging million miles per week this means that even if the tesla autopilot got into a fatal accident once a week every single week that fatality rate would be more than twice as safe as human drivers i think you severely overestimate what it takes to be better than the average driver and just perceive a higher risk because its a loss of control not cause its actually riskier
1143,thats an impressive false dichotomy statistically the safest place to be in america even safer than your own home is on an airplane being flown by an autopilot think about that for a second yes i would love to live in a society that prioritizes public transportation and doesnt hand out licenses like candy i hate to be the bearer of bad news but we dont live in that reality in the real world someone is on their th bender this week and is right now starting the ignition on a giant minivan and hoping they dont get pulled over right now somewhere the state is reluctant to take away an almost blind grandmas license because we havent prioritized public transit for decades and her family is gone so she is reliant on the car to get her groceries and medicine i also have worked in tech all my life youre right that its a giant house of cards and theres no way to safeguard it but is anything in life get your head out of the clouds man if we always waited for wed be extinct by now i want cars to be as safe as airplanes and that means taking all but the best humans out of the loop

1149,it gets interesting when you consider how bad the average motorist is so early rolling out of a system thats not completely safe should be safer than not doing so provided its still statistically safer than not implementing it ive got no idea how bad this recent update is it anything btw or how other manufacturers systems are performing under closed testing but at some point while they are still quite deadly they will be safer and thats close to the right time to implement them imo

1161,them being willing to pay has nothing to do with the safety of it it isnt just their lives being risked its the others in the car and people outside of the car too also if you car suddenly veers into a pillar at mph switching over to the human is pretty much pointless as its already too late

1163,if we are talking about safety chritical a human can take over at any time thats not considered a reliable fail safe for a couple of reasons humans cant react as quickly as computers can so if a computer makes a wrong decision it will take a human longer to make a right decision and at mph that can be deadly additionally theres a wealth of research showing that people monitoring automated systems just stop paying attention after a while so the odds that the driver will catch an error in time drop dramatically as trip length increases

1170,good info thanks id still prefer an external auditor to ensure that the process in place is actually safe and that tesla is actually adhering to the steps every time theres a release but i dont care if its a government audit or a third party private auditor as long as they are able to verify it
1171,its funny isnt it not that we shouldnt hold high standards for driving safety but humans should be held to just as high of a standard as autonomous systems are probably the reason people arent held to that standard is because if they were the number of people holding a drivers license would instantly be cut by
1172,its funny isnt it not that we shouldnt hold high standards for driving safety but humans should be held to just as high of a standard as autonomous systems are probably the reason people arent held to that standard is because if they were the number of people holding a drivers license would instantly be cut by
1173,most people who die in car accidents are either breaking laws or the victims of people who have broken laws i dont think its an acceptable standard to decide that as long as robots do about as well as or somewhat better than humans at driving that everything is cool since that also includes all the humans who have died because they were doing something that we have made illegal like speeding distracted driving drunk driving etc the benchmark we use should not be how well does autonomous driving do against the sum total of all humans it should be how well does autonomous driving do against all the humans killed in accidents where they were not speeding not drunk not texting and not sleepy and actually a robot has killed a person yeah it was stupid and yeah youll think its bullshit but there really was a person who was run over by a car when they were walking with their bike at night there have been more cases of people killed by ignoring instructions to keep their hands on a wheel and then self driving cars would fail to see semis in front of them its only zero ever if you decide to ignore fatalities that have happened with people who ignored instructions to keep their hands on the wheel but theres a difference between the duty of an engineering team to design something that is hard to misuse and the realities of people who get distracted teslas team of engineers could have made it impossible to use self driving in unsafe ways if they wanted to but instead a person fell asleep with autopilot on and got decapitated by a semi thats an annoying inconvenience to address but its still there
1174,i dont agree that haywire or calamity as another on this thread called it is remotely appropriate if you imagine a perfect drive buggy software seems imperfect but humans dont have perfect drives die every year in the us alone add to that the number of injured and the billions in financial damages and you have the true real world baseline for current driving so does a beta software released to s of specifically safe drivers all of whom have been told that the software will likely make bad choices at the worst time qualify as going haywire when it randomly hits the brakes hell no the user can take control instantly the user is supposed to be paying attention they are holding the wheel they are warned in advance the user is selected from a small group of humans specifically based on their ability to consistently drive safe predictably and smooth the situation is far less dangerous than a squirrel running across the road in front of a regular driver is a squirrel crossing the road in front of a car indicative of a super dangerous situation would you have told your friends your drive went haywire on the way home if that happened of course not you probably wouldnt have told anyone because its not newsworthy just like this whole post

1180,of the m miles between accidents in manual mode would be on freeway and m off of it for the m miles in autopilot m would be on freeway and just off of it so the manual record is roughly one accident per m miles off freeway and per m miles on freeway but the autopilot record ballparks to m miles between accidents off freeway and m on freeway in other words about longer without an accident in manual with forward collision avoidance on or tacc than in autopilot instead of being safer with autopilot it looks like a tesla is slightly less safe

1184,early and safe are inherently contradictory when talking about software in order for it to be considered safe it needs to be thoroughly and rigorously tested data collected and analyzed since the only information i have about their process right now is that they themselves consider this software early and they are rolling back this update because it was causing safety issues it was ipso facto not tested thoroughly enough at least giving them the benefit of the doubt that they did not intentionally release unsafe software either way it is very clear that they do not have any data to prove that this software is safer than a human driver

1187,its early release software that is currently being rolled back because it was causing cars to go haywire its not safer than a human driver you can make the argument that computers have the potential to be safer drivers than humans due to reaction times or whatever but that doesnt automatically mean any software you write to drive a car automatically is good and safe the software needs to be meticulously engineered and rigorously tested not rolled out like a shitty early access video game and set loose on public roads

1189,nothing about this requires a certification in automotive safety its click bait tesla did a beta test to a controlled group of cars and instantly reverted the software when they werent happy with user reports of invalid collision warnings the actual facts make this story a positive for tesla it shows they arent taking risks inside their beta program

1191,im sorry but youre parroting the same shady thing tesla did tesla does not tabulate the same metric as the nhsta but instead uses a more severe crash instead of accident to make it appear as if fewer of them happen if ford came out and releases safety data only looking at times the airbag went off i dont think you keep your same opinion you just cant randomly make up apples to oranges comparisons arent safer on autopilot so researchers calling for driver monitoring may be right you also cant compare mostly freeway miles to all miles thats just laughably statistically biased

1200,first off if your hands are on the wheel or not doesnt directly indicate driver engagement it is a surrogate for driver engagement which is why there is a timer on it and it will lock you out secondly hands off the wheel for short periods of time does not constitute complacency the overall monitoring of the system performance is still intact complacency is a choice when the vehicle operator chooses to operate the vehicle in an unsafe way

1210,i want to really sit down and chat with the guy who answers the former instead of the latter i dont like the way tesla is treating the idea of putting full on self driving cars out there as if its some cute little windows update for people to try on but what matters more than anything is the actual impact this has on human lives straight up if self driving overall reduces the number of vehicular fatalities and injuries even if it causes accidents where otherwise there objectively would not have been one it is a net positive and i fully encourage putting it out there in the safest way possible its hard to get over the mental flip out with the thought that maybe the robo brain in someones car decides to swerve for no reason and kills an innocent pedestrian but we dont react with the same blanket damnation over human driving when some drunk or tired driver goes careening into someones house and crushes someone whos sleeping in their bed the objective analysis needs to be the deciding factor self driving can be improved human error is much harder to govern but at the same time that also doesnt excuse a high error rate from fsd it will get better cant be an excuse if theres a net negative today

1217,the only truly important regulation would be car makers are liable for all accidents caused by the self driving car that alone should guarantee that they will spend billions of dollars in research ensuring that the car is both safe for autonomous driving as well as secure against remote hacks any other fixed regulation will just get them to comply with the minimum legal requirements and there isnt any guarantee that those regulations are perfect or even optimal for self driving car safety in fact the government has even hinted that it doesnt want to impose too many regulations on the car makers because its still an infant domain it makes sense but as i said if they were reliable that would be all the incentive they needed to ensure maximum safety and security

1219,i highly recommend test driving a model s tesla with auto driving it was so incredible i just kept thinking how is elon so far ahead of everyone else and why doesnt every car have this its not just self driving as if you can take a nap its the fact that the steering wheel and throttle and brakes gently nudge the car keeping it in the center of the lane and a safe distance back which is so much nicer in crowded driving conditions
1220,we mostly need the laws so they can sell the tech not because people will actually follow them speed limits exist too meanwhile everyones cruising over everywhere and keep in mind its still extremely early days for this stuff even though it is safer than humans its not and wont be people are still going to die in the hands of self driving cars just with any luck itll be tens per year and not tens of thousands

1233,we do need laws we do need regulations we do need guidance i fully expect many of these will be fairly light handed and nothing underhanded speed limits share a very explicit purpose many people frequent roads that they dont drive frequently posted speed limits inform the drive what speed is safe for the road and what speeds the road was designed for sure you could bring up some fringe case like the autobahn but that road does have frequent speed limits as someone who has drove on it and people know it is reasonable and safe to drive faster on that road because it was designed for excess speed
1234,isnt that the current failsafe on human driving too
1235,in some oncoming decades manual drivers might be a little miffed about their insurance premiums going to high z because theyre literally making other cars on the streets less safe by manual driving just like how people dont ride horses down busy streets youre going to be looking at manual driving being relegated to tracks
1236,a car stepping in to stop you crashing is a long way off the reaosn self driving cars are safe is they avoid dangerous situations theyre not actually much better than most humans at averting an imminent crash
1237,why as a human youre much more dangerous other people are at risk even to the extent that compulsary rd party insurance removes the risk of you costing other parties money theres still the risk you could maim or kill them should people still have the option to drive extremely old unsafe cars in many juristictions classic car enthusiasts arent allowed to take their old cars on the roads also synergy between autonomous vehicles means the road networks will work better without human drivers even a small number of human drivers will cause problems
1238,the problem is that were going to hold back something that is demonstrably safer because were comparing it to the way things should be and not the way things actually are
1239,the problem is that were going to hold back something that is demonstrably safer because were comparing it to the way things should be and not the way things actually are
1240,i think what they mean is that premiums will go up for those choosing to control and drive their own cars because they arent going to be as safe on the road for and compared to other drivers wholl be riding in self driving cars and not controlling them so because self driving cars are safer premiums will go up for those who choose to drive themselves

1242,im all for every car on the road choosing safety of the time i also dont see that as being much of an issue again due to their better response time a computer will be able to safely drive faster than a human could and if having to leave for work minutes earlier so driving recklessly isnt necessary is the only downside id say thats a damn good compromise leaving aside the absurd idea that driving like an asshole gets one to work any earlier

1244,people prefer to be in control and result in the death of people than let a robot be in control and potentially kill if a driver kills its an accident if a robot kills its bad programming and intended its going to be a long time until people accept the new av paradigm as safer and even if right now many people already know that they are safer they will still dont release the wheel

1246,car broker here if you buylease any base luxury car they wont come with many standard safety options a lexus k nx base doesnt come with blind spot you need to add a k option trim level to get it yet a k sante fe comes with it all of those commercials you see on tv about auto braking are bs virtually none of the cars come with them standard you would need to go up in trim levels to get that function think that outback you see next to you has eyesight braking does not come standard except at one trim level which costs more than the base model the base model outback doesnt even allow you to chose it as an option you must spend k more on a higher trim then add another k in for the eyesight which means that is a k option which you are now going to pay interest and tax on so call it point is we are getting there but your avg car lasts years and its going to take some time until just the basic safety gear is ubiquitous

1248,and that their own mad driving skillz wont save them from the drivers they already know are bad honestly though even knowing how much safer self driving cars are its a weird feeling knowing that you really have no influence over the risk despite knowing that it is reduced thats another hurdle even after you get people to accept the numbers

1250,people arent really the problem honestly if you give people the ability to have a self driving uber show up at their door and drive them wherever they need to go whenever they need to go for a fraction of the cost of automotive ownership people will use it in droves the problem is all the industries people having that level of convenience and safety disrupts those industries auto manufacturing petrochemical insurance rely on every commuter needing or wanting their own personal vehicle they dont make enough money otherwise and if that means they keep driving over a million dead bodies most of whom are children a year to do it thats exactly what theyre going to keep doing and why they bribe governments to kill self driving technology

1252,its not entirely an illusion though your safety depends a lot on your own driving after all
1253,its not entirely an illusion though your safety depends a lot on your own driving after all
1254,in this context imperfect means not guaranteed to never crash self driving technology is already safe enough to be unlikely to crash and potentially already better than people
1255,reportedly its already twice as safe as human drivers but they are aiming at x safety all teslas being sold today are fully capable of driving themselves but regulations prevent them from doing so
1256,reportedly its already twice as safe as human drivers but they are aiming at x safety all teslas being sold today are fully capable of driving themselves but regulations prevent them from doing so
1257,im not arguing that they dont drive safer than humans im arguing your assertion that its not difficult for machines especially when encountering new situations that a human would have little to no trouble with the fact that we can drive without eyes in the back of our head centimeter precise depth perception radar that can see through nearby cars a literal trunk full of computation and storage and detailed pre collected maps of exactly every road we are driving on is how i know that its not easy for computers let me know when a computer is safer at driving just by having two cameras and two microphones and ill tell you its now easy for cars

1259,we didnt evolve to be able to drive we evolved to handle that sort of input and real time analysis however you still seem to be arguing about the relative abilities of cars vs computers which im not talking about im pointing out that its difficult for a computer to drive a car thats why its cutting edge technology with a handful of companies even trying to make it happen you know what isnt difficult for a computer spreadsheets databases that stuff thats so easy foss programmers give it away for free its not at all easy for computers to drive cars and it wont be for many many years even if theyre already better at it than humans its not easy for them and its not easy to improve them if it was easy to improve them when they made a mistake we wouldnt teach them how to avoid the mistake by giving them hundreds of thousands of miles of driving wed say dont turn left in front of oncoming traffic or wed say a flashing left yellow arrow means you can turn if its safe it wouldnt take examples to teach them the difference between a real stop sign and a stop sign on a roadside billboard as part of an advertisement
1260,yeah its an actual ban on driving manual on public roads thats the point just like we ban unsafe vehicles from public roads now just because we accept a level of death and injury today doesnt mean we have to continue to accept that status quo indefinitely regardless of advances
1261,of the m miles between accidents in manual mode would be on freeway and m off of it for the m miles in autopilot m would be on freeway and just off of it so the manual record is roughly one accident per m miles off freeway and per m miles on freeway but the autopilot record ballparks to m miles between accidents off freeway and m on freeway in other words about longer without an accident in manual with forward collision avoidance on or tacc than in autopilot instead of being safer with autopilot it looks like a tesla is slightly less safe tesla refuses to release the data or confirm on why it insists on using a different crash metric which only filters more severe crashes to make it look like theyve had fewer if it were better why play all these tricks

1263,regulation doesnt halt progress it usually just guides it this particular regulation issue was so obvious that i wrote about it years ago in uni before fsd was even a thing in this case we need an independent agency to verify all self driving programs are as they claim safer than your average driver its very easy to mislead people who dont have a masters degree in statistics and machine learning about these things if tesla is genuinely as good as everyone claims they are then there should be nothing to worry about hell they can even take the first step and help make some testing guidelines we need a yard stick for car ais

1265,it depends on which metrics you care about counting every mph ding where no one gets hurt isnt going to give a good indication about whether its safer or not so if the metric you care about is personal safety then you would exclude accidents where there isnt harm if you care more about property than personal safety then you would include all accidents
1266,it depends on which metrics you care about counting every mph ding where no one gets hurt isnt going to give a good indication about whether its safer or not so if the metric you care about is personal safety then you would exclude accidents where there isnt harm if you care more about property than personal safety then you would include all accidents

1268,are you saying that they dont use the same rules for counting manual and autopilot accidents according to their safety report methodology listed on the bottom of their safety report page methodology we collect the amount of miles traveled by each vehicle with autopilot active or in manual driving based on available data we receive from the fleet and do so without identifying specific vehicles to protect privacy we also receive a crash alert anytime a crash is reported to us from the fleet which may include data about whether autopilot was active at the time of impact to ensure our statistics are conservative we count any crash in which autopilot was deactivated within seconds before impact and we count all crashes in which the incident alert indicated an airbag or other active restraint deployed our crash statistics are not based on sample data sets or estimates in practice this correlates to nearly any crash at about mph kph or above depending on the crash forces generated on the other hand police reported crashes from government databases are notoriously under reported by some estimates as much as in large part because most minor crashes like fender benders are not investigated we also do not differentiate based on the type of crash or fault for example more than of all autopilot crashes occur when the tesla vehicle is rear ended by another vehicle in this way we are confident that the statistics we share unquestionably show the benefits of autopilot there isnt a differentiation between the manual or autopilot methodology in here so its very apples to apples

1270,because you cannot do that without bias tesla does not report the same statistics if you compare them its not apples to apples and tesla will look like less because they have only more serious crashes included if you use biased data youre going to get biased results tesla carefully chose their language and recklessly compared different data arent safer on autopilot so researchers calling for driver monitoring may be right

1272,there isnt a better way to compare them nhtsa and tesla source their data differently nhtsa only has police reported data tesla has its car reported metrics the best you can do is teslas own data compared between autopilot and manual which per mile shows its safer to use autopilot if you want to change that result by weighing metrics over whether or not freeway miles count as much as ruralcity miles you are going to need to be rather methodical about it

1274,ah yes because thats the important detail and aside from that human drivers are notoriously safe statisticsdetailstate by state
1275,first and foremost its something of a logical fallacy yes on average self driving cars have a lower accident rate but if youre a safe driver you might have a lower accident rate than a self driving car also you have control over how safely you drive whereas in a self driving car youre not in control of the risk factors tesla is known for covering up high profile crashes with their autopilot system you can read more on that if youre interested

1278,i would say self driving cars are safe to a point i still wouldnt trust a sdc with the moral quandry of preserving the life of a driver or pedestrian and having to make the choice of whether the car should or shouldnt hit a pole to avoid the pedestrians
1279,the solution is that we dont focus on very very unlikely scenarios to test self driving cars in which scenarios even a human couldnt make the right decision if they even made one and not just acted out of panic and start focusing on the every day safety of a self driving car a self driving car ye theres a lot of repetition xd already drives many times more safely than a regular driver

1281,it might be obvious if the cars were always self driving the problem is that at the moment they are only partly so and that will probably continue for a long time this means that the car will hand control over to the user at times and may do so at short notice when the user is not paying attention if a crash results is that going to be legally the fault of the user or of the company which designed the car which handed over control while the user was pouring coffee if the company goes out of business must any cars of that brand be taken off the road despite a good safety record i can see the arguments for holding the company entirely responsible and i used to take this line now i think that it cant be simplified that much

1283,is that going to be legally the fault of the user or of the company which designed the car which handed over control while the user was pouring coffee this isnt what current semi autonomous vehicles are meant for as much as i think the tech is dangerous i cant really blame the manufacturer when people fail to follow what is legally required of them if the company goes out of business must any cars of that brand be taken off the road despite a good safety record i can see manufacturers being required to have insurance covering this or for all of them to pay into a single pot to cover it

1285,its pretty easy actually all items that are sold in this country need to pass a certain certification standard you simply write into the lawstandard what a car must be capable of doing to be fit for sale you simply regulate what is required of an automated car like all cars the vehicle must pass an mot this could also include software updates that comply with the standards therefore the company is responsible for the safety of these features while the user is responsible for ensuring the vehicle meets the standard agreed upon

1287,easily the manufacturer will insure the car except they wont they wont have any need to insurance is useful for low risk catastrophically costly one offs where when something goes wrong its a struggle to pay for whatever it is from cash flow so for a person car crashes and house fires would be those things for the likes of ford and toyota however absorbing the cost of much much lower risk autonomous vehicle car crashes would be near negligible and so absorbed by routine cash flow we are still a couple decades away from autonomous vehicle safety reaching this point but eventually they will kill off the car insurance industry

1289,car insurance is compulsory due to the high rate of expensive accidents otherwise it wouldnt be needed it isnt compulsory for bikespramsroller skates because the rate of claims would be vastly exceeded by admin costs so yes with safe cars insurance could cease although probably wouldnt since old habits die hard
1290,you would have been responsible for stopping the car speeding up to mph if you are supposed to be supervising you must be supervising all of the time not just when an accident happens you would be responsible for ensuring not only that there isnt an accident but that the vehicle is driving safely if the car is doing up to a blind corner then you have failed to supervise
1291,fully charged has a good episode this week there are claimed level self driving vehicles now operating in china teslas are level requiring constant attention from the driver level allows the driver to take her eyes off the road but be ready to take over if the car gets stuck level must transfer control in a safe way level will do everything and might not need driver controls but is restricted to certain suitable roads level can basically do anything a human driver can do youtuberpjxtqs i remain a little sceptical even if a computer can handle any normal driving event what about when a bouncy castle suddenly blows over the roundabout edit i tweaked my explanation of the self driving levels as i read the law society report pdf s eu west amazonawscomlawcom prod storage jsxouuyquploadsautomated vehicles joint report cvr pdf
1292,okay ill re phrase that because to me it was clear we were talking about normal individual people you dont think car insurance should be a legal requirement for normal individual people and im asking about it currently not if extremely safe self driving cars become the norm also as of it seems like royal mail have some amount of third party liability car insurance too
1293,a level self driving car will not just dump an emergency in your lap it must transfer control in a safe way so for example might stop on a dirt track and require the occupant to take over if a level car is on a motorway and there is a crash ahead it will take evasive action otherwise its level
1294,i think ultimately these responsibilities will delay the fully automated driving with these companies just trying to avoid that potential liability and we will end up with a lot of cars that could be classified as level but still retaining human controls to avoid the manufacturer taking that leap im not sure whats best a lot of drivers are already driving distracted so it may end up making things much safer even if its not ideal

1298,i dont know if there is a change of view they would have to retrofit lidar to all their cars if so the graphics i have seen of a teslas view of the roads look as impressive as those of waymo or baidhu that said i am just a little sceptical that anyone has managed to overcome the problem of a car driving at level able to deal with any ordinary driving occurrence but it needs to be able to safely transfer control with extreme reliability when something outside its experience happens
1299,yes it does mean some computer science work to be done maybe rather than communication it could be done by having the traffic lights and crossings operate on known schedule to the second and the cars know that schedule i think they would need to be able to see red lights too as a failsafe i rather wish there was more appetite for road maintainers to work with car makers in developing features to aid autonomy all a self driving car needs to know at the most basic level is where is its path and is there anything in the way
1300,imo this technology will never reach the point where it is safer than human drivers i really cant understand why companies are pissing away so much money on something that is really not needed what is going to happen when the computer that makes the whole thing work crashes the sensors fail or some mud gets on the road and the vehicle in front of it kicks up the mud and it covers up the sensors and the autonomous vehicle cant see the car in front of it or the edge of the road i also want to see what happens when one of these self driving cars meets a farmer driving a huge tractor or a combine on a narrow country road is the computer going to be able to pull the car off onto the shoulder to let the machine pass or is it going to get squished under the huge tires like the junkers at a monster truck rally i get so fed up with new technology sometimes that i am really tempted to just go join the amish they live pretty much the same way my grandparents did until the end of wwii and there is a lot to be said for that lifestyle my grandparents got their first car circa but didnt have electricity in their farmhouse until and my grandad farmed with horses until only two decades before i was born

1304,one of the big problems is all this damn technology they are putting in new cars people are too distracted by their in vehicle infotainment system and too busy fiddling with the touch screen on the dash to pay attention to the damn road i dont care if you have bluetooth and it is hands free if you are talking on the phone while driving you are distracted our roads would be far safer if all of this new technology were banned by the ntsb and automakers were forced to go back to making cars like they were years ago with simple easy to use knobs and buttons

1316,its not unlikely to come up it will never come up it doesnt come up for human drivers for a reason why should it come up for digital drivers why dont we teach young drivers how to choose who to run over when they face this choice using all of the traction available to stop while staying in the designated lane of travel is not equivalent to killing the person on the track its equivalent to not killing anyone in almost all cases this is why we instead teach young human drivers to watch out slow down in certain situations and hit the brakes if things go sideways cars have a finite amount of traction available to be used between both turning and braking unlike the trolley problem which has infinite traction available for turning and zero tracking available for braking in most cases if a pedestrian steps out in front of you and you have a choice between driving onto the sidewalk and hitting some pedestrians driving into the other lane and hitting some pedestrians or hitting the brakes real hard the correct choice is actually the brakes if the car was traveling at a safe speed which it will be it can stop before it hits the pedestrian especially if it has attention and sub human reaction times you dont code it to weigh the value of each life you just code it to safely avoid the accident if possible and if not possible minimize the impact forces theres no railroad switch because choosing who to kill is a false dichotomy based on imaginary physics

1321,i certainly hope that liability shifts to the manufacturer but there are other ways to do it you could make it a consumer liability by having them bear the costs of insurance making consumer awareness of safety ratings of vehicles important with that being the driver of insurance costs manufacturers would presumably compete to have the safest cars since safer cars translate to lower costs for the consumer being able to tell a consumer hey your insurance would only cost a month with our vehicle providing you in savings over ten years compared to our competitor one reason you might want the liability to at least partly rest with the consumer is to drive consumers to do proper maintenance

1326,youre damn right this supposed dilemma has no relevance to anyone making an sdc in real life youd think anyone who has been driving a car for years without having to make a similar decision would understand this right away but its still every armchair pundits favourite talking point especially if you meet someone socially and you tell them you work on sdcs but this isnt even the trolley problem the original form of the trolley problem is that you have to choose between letting the trolley kill n people but its not your fault or switching tracks so it will kill person but you did it at its heart its a question about acts of commission vs omission blame and liability and its been the core of the auto industrys approach to driver assist for at least the last years probably longer the corresponding dilemma for the auto industry is this say you have a new emergency braking system that prevents some percentage of fatal accidents so if you deployed it in all new cars it would save x lives per year but its not a perfect system so sometimes it might brake or swerve unnecessarily costing y lives per year but the x deaths that happen if you do nothing are not your fault or as the legal system works youre not liable for them whereas the y deaths that might happen would definitely leave the manufacturer liable in a perfect world maybe the choice of whether to ship the system would be whether x y maybe youd take into account some other factors like it would make people drive more recklessly endangering more lives that you hadnt accounted for or the deaths caused by the system are more or less traumatic for drivers that could be an interesting moral discussion but the auto industrys solution to this is that you only ship the system if y theyre quite happy for drivers to kill any number of people with their cars so long as the manufacturer isnt liable the number one phrase used by people who write safety critical software for the legacy auto industry is but what if it makes it crash into a bus full of lawyers children thats why the first aeb systems only started braking after the driver did and its why the idea of robotaxis where theres no driver to shift liability to is so disruptive to the industry its still not very relevant to anyones day to day work as an sdc engineer but the trolley problem well a legalistic reading of it is key to the formation of the sdc industry

1328,yup my teslas autopilot isnt full self driving but its not trying to detect if im going to hit a car building bike woman man kid etc its only trying to stay in its lane and avoid hitting anything while following driving laws also much more safely than many drivers following too closely or zig zagging between cars to save minute of their drive its indeed more of a philosophy problem than a fsd ai programming real life topic
1329,tldr some decisions need to made and the serious competitors in the space understand that it is highly situation dependent sdc will need to robust to some situations that need to have decisions made ie attempt to brake vs change lanes if you are on a high way and something falls off of a truck blocking your lane and you have an empty shoulder to your side i find it hard to justify not swerving into the shoulder if the braking distance is too short similarly if you are driving down a residential road and a child runs out into the road i expect the majority of the public to agree that the vehicle should attempt to avoid hitting the kid even if it ends with the vehicle hitting a parked car i dont think we will see cars getting to the point where they need to reason between very particular classes ie hit the nun vs the child the chances of these decisions coming up are rather low but i do think that we will see vehicles classify the occupancy grid around them as empty space person vehicle collidable object and non collidable object most sdc companies take their employees to a track to learn defensive driving and they teach how to swerve around obstacles for a reason they also cover situations such as how to recover from a spin due to a bad tire or the vehicle oversteering in a turn xb i think we see that companies which are reasonable while erring for caution and prioritizing safety will win out in the end ie the waymos and auroras of the world as opposed to the ubers

1331,there are definitely situations swerving can work that stopping doesnt at highway speeds it takes the length of a football field to stop even assuming ideal road conditions and a properly maintained vehicle assuming something runs out in front of you its quite possible for it to be possible to swerve but not stop the real reason trolley problems have practically zero real world relevance is theyre exceptionally rare and predicted safety benefits from autonomous vehicles are magnitudes larger even if autonomous vehicles exploded ever time they were faced with a trolley problem and killed everybody within feet it would still be largely irrelevant

1333,surely the catch all solution would be to stay in your lane and brake depending on how fast youre going this could hurt the passenger although i agree that its probably easiest to control the safety inside of the car and make external decisions based on what improves safety outside the car why would there be time to swerve if there isnt time to brake because you keep going forward even when you brake even if you were to immediately crush the wheel by pressing relentlessly hard on it the wheels arent attached to the road so its still going to skid the idea of swerving is to redirect that momentum at a safer target that said some of these trolley problems are kind of contrived city and town roads are rated for their safest possible speed so its on par with your hair dryer burning your house down yeah technically both can happen but its so rare that we dont really plan society around it youd only run into trolley problem stuff going highway speeds but those are typically inaccessible to pedestrians and graded to maximize visibility the more likely dilemma is probably is it better to swerve into this other car right now drive off the highway or let this other car hit me which would likely send me into this other car anyways the answer is probably deploy airbags and drive off highway but i actually dont know that one but thats a little harder to visualize so people go with the pedestrian example

1336,i wholeheartedly agree one point i want to add as i assume you will tell others in the future computers can make multiple decisions at the same time the reason we dont have outer airbags to protect in case of collision is that humans wouldnt be able to react fast enough and think about deploying them the braking distance is near when you can deploy anchors into the tarmac you can have like tens of fail safes for all unlikely scenarios and a computer can deploy them in time a human however can only swerve a wheel and press a pedal
1337,thats still not a dilemma if its safe to swerve and avoid the obstacle then do it the on board computer will be much better at determining what kind of evasive maneuver is safe than a driver ever would
1338,if a pedestrian lunges into the street without time to react any human driver would hit them too in fact a human would have significantly less time to find a safe alternative than an sdc
1339,if theres a pedestrian close enough to lunge in front of the vehicle then it already should have slowed down or changed lanes the same can be said about blind spots if were concerned about this slowing down traffic then we either need to make more sensors available to vehicles shared vehicle sensors stationary publicly accessible sensors or change our road designs like weve already done with highways to limit access and enhance visibility just because a vehicle is capable of going mph doesnt mean it should be going that fast if its not safe
1340,thats what i was thinking about that and the bone breaking forces on anything short of a full body seatbelt tbh i think well go the other way and let people move around freely because youre driving slower and with more safety
1341,thats what i was thinking about that and the bone breaking forces on anything short of a full body seatbelt tbh i think well go the other way and let people move around freely because youre driving slower and with more safety
1342,if youre really concerned with everyones safety in that hypothetical story networked self driving cars are the best chance of no one getting hurt the cars will detect the child moving toward the street long before a human would and can run through all contingency plans and find the best one in addition the car will already be driving conservatively based on data obscured sides of road in a way that most humans wouldnt i suppose there are rare situations where something changes very suddenly and the laws of physics now dictate that something is going to get hit but even then the car can plan faster than a person could and minimize the damage

1344,dont forget the edge case kid jumps in front of car at some distance robot reaction brings the car safely to a stop the ms or more for a human driver to react means the kid is hit while there are cases where no one really wins human and robot drivers both fail there are other cases where the robot clearly wins
1345,other than the issue that utoomuchtodotoday brought up that potentially the law could dictate that you do different things based on the age of the person i think the law states that if you swerve to avoid an accident and end up causing another one then you are at fault therefore the car shouldnt swerve of course i would assume that if the car detects a safe way out of the accident then it would take it as i pointed out in another comment none of these issues are unique to sdcs and already have a body of laws and litigation dictating what the correct course of action should be if a car is programmed to follow those standards then there shouldnt be ant problems the issue is that people have a problem specifically deciding that a specific innocent person should be injured over another ahead of the fact they are much more comfortable with such decisions being made in the heat of the moment by a human being because you can more easily sweep it under the rug as just being an accident thats harder to accept when the decision was made years ahead of time on a computer somewhere
1346,im not so sure it is as clear cut as that human and sdcs have to make assumptions about how others will act in order to function after all on a road without a divider any oncoming car could swerve into your lane at any point the only way to proceed is to assume that they wont likewise a pedestrian on the side of the road could jump out into the road at any time too traffic isnt going to slow down because someone might jump into the street however children are an exception to this rule most people will be more cautious around children a possible issue with sdcs could be that they might not be able to classify moving objects into categories fine enough to distinguish an adult from a child even if that is the case the superior sensors of a car should be able to make up the difference theyll be better at some things like not having blind spots or being distracted theyll be worse at others like not being able to recognize a situation developing that would cause a person to suddenly run into the road like for example another person about to throw them a ball taken as a whole though between the better sensors and reaction time sdcs should be much safer

1348,copied response below from another reply ill also add that you arent under any responsibility to injure yourself to help someone else even more importantly you definitely shouldnt injure an innocent third party to protect someone else we wont program these cars to be heros well program them for the minimum legal liability and greatest passenger safety minimizing legal liability is what we as a society have decided is the right thing to do you also have to remember the context in which im making these statements buffet said that these types of situations would be a hinderance to sdc adoption im saying they wont because we as a society have already decided what the solution should be these situations are not unique to sdcs in addition simply breaking with a perception and reaction time greater than any human is a perfectly acceptable solution no sdc is going to get in trouble with the law for not swerving into oncoming traffic also no emergency driver assistance system on a car today would even think about swerving and nobody bats an eye if anything would be a hinderance to sdc adoption it would be if people knew that their car was designed to crash into oncoming traffic for the benefit of someone else so i say again the solution is simple the car should break as hard as it can and hit the child there is no legal problem with doing that and that policy isnt going to spook potential ownerspassengers of the car

1350,i fully believe that on the whole sdcs will be far safer than human driven ones i am just acknowledging that there could be some specific cases in which a human would be better thats going to create interesting discussions if out of situations a self driving car is better than humans in of them will people still focus on that other for reasons not to use them after all it will be those that will get all the news coverage no one is going to know about the of accidents that were prevented other than a general reduction in overall incidents

1352,and if i walk straight in front of the car stopping distance is now feet what if i cross the road in what feels a safe distance to me but the car feels otherwise
1353,and if i walk straight in front of the car stopping distance is now feet sorry that doesnt make any sense to me what if i cross the road in what feels a safe distance to me but the car feels otherwise you are going to have to be more specific braking distance at mph is meters the real question is how much can a car swerve at that speed while braking can a car swerve both left and right effectively in one movement because swerving only works if the object you are looking to avoid is stationary or moves in the opposite direction to the vehicle
1354,waymo is ahead because google wanted to do this over years ago they have had it on their mind as they build all their other stuff so today google has more data of the physical world than anyone else that they can leverage they know when there is an accident with waze they know when there is a traffic jam they can see the traffic light patterns and when the pattern changes they can see the data where there is a stop sign or even a stop sign has been removed waymo is using a database the cars drive from so if the database indicates a stop sign they stop they do not have to see the stop sign but if the database indicates a stop sign and there is non that they see they create an exception that is logged and the situation is looked into but google can also verify what is happening by using the human driver behavior that they get through google maps and google waze they know if a protest closes a road in real time if a parade they even know how busy a store is at a particular time they know when the stores open and close google has built up their data in prepartion for the data for self driving car robot taxi service and having far better utilization than anyone else but not just the data google has the infrastructure to support you need the ability to handle lots of data coming in make sense of it and get events to cars in real time sound familiar ultimately self driving cars is a software engineering problem google attracts the top engineers in the world so they basically get more first round draft choices than anyone once the cream of the crop comes in and is hire they then can take the cream of the crop of the cream of the crop and send them to waymo google created a virtual california that they can inject diffrent situations this is just vital for doing automated testing i have zero clue how gmforduber and the others are doing this i suspect they just are not why i cant see them getting to a safe solution you are making software and model changes you need to be sure that your change is not breaking something else you need to be able to first do virtual testing there is just so many other factors that favor googlewaymo than just being the only ones that have it working without safety drivers google has b in the bank for example with less than b debt they could buy gm and have plenty left over if they wanted to the piece googlewaymo is missing and nobody has is the car durability data today taxi companies buy regular cars they are not optimized for using as a taxi waymo will now collect data like there has never been before on the cars and that data will drive improvement in durability well beyond cars of today that will enable them to drive down the cost of self driving cars robot taxi service to be cheaper than using your own car within years ultimately waymo will use that data to build cars as it will ultimately be a competitive advantage but they should buy cars until they get the data gathered and then they should buy car making expertise and not do it organically then there is an entirely different angles that google has advantageous that nobody is close at having right now of the top apps used on all smart phones are owned by google enwikipediaorgwikilist_of_most_popular_smartphone_apps gm ford honda combined do not have a single one so there is discovery to summon a car google is unmatched in this area no other company close so you type car into search and a car shows up or you add a calendar event and you get a pop up do you need a car you write an email to get dinner with a friend next week and you both get a pop up do you need a car i saw a stat recently that new email accounts today are more than going to gmail they now have over billion active accounts but it is not only on your phone google in the smart speaker space has moved ahead of amazon even thought getting to the market years later move over amazon echo google home now sits upon the smart speaker throne home most popular speaker so you with google you can just be in your house and say car now and a car shows up gmfordhonda do not have smart speakers honestly never understood how any of this could be debated it is not like it is close now i am someone that does not believe people will be buying self driving cars does not make any sense to me that is people thinking the old world i also do not believe level will happen for decades and possibly not in my life time we have no idea how to do it it will not be as safe as level but there is probably not the financial benefits to spend the billions to do level ultimately it comes down to money we have no idea the processing power that would be required to do level it might be we are a long way from having the silicon to support i think it is far more likely level rolled out like you would roll out cell service area by area with the ones that make you the most money first with self driving cars it will also be driven by government regulation you can get to coverage in probably the next years with level you will then connect city to city so you do phoenix and do tuscon and then you do the highways inbetween eventually you are covering most of the us btw the confusion with level is caused by musk he is way smarter than i and knows better he says things that are simply ridiculous then people believe them the one i find most funny is having the hardware to do level we do not have the algorithms to do level so the idea of having the silicon to support is absurd how can you know that if we do not have algorithms

out like you would roll out cell service area by area with the ones that make you the most money first with self driving cars it will also be driven by government regulation you can get to coverage in probably the next years with level you will then connect city to city so you do phoenix and do tuscon and then you do the highways inbetween eventually you are covering most of the us btw the confusion with level is caused by musk he is way smarter than i and knows better he says things that are simply ridiculous then people believe them the one i find most funny is having the hardware to do level we do not have the algorithms to do level so the idea of having the silicon to support is absurd how can you know that if we do not have algorithms
1356,think youre misunderstanding how the sdc era will bring along new hardware that the automakers are better prepared to deal with youre right sdcs wouldnt need the external devices you mentioned however the car interior and exterior will be a brand new playground cars could be giant pods with couches and tvs inside or moving offices etc gmford have the factories in place to design and develop this stuff my roommate is an engineer who works solely for a big automaker seating they spend millions on seat durability and safety testing for new style vehicles and could fairly easily continue to shift production to new age seating waymo will have to partner with other parties which is expensive can lead to compatibility issues and will lose the integrated efficiency of big auto lastly gmford depend on this market like this is literally their only play google is going i to a million different directions i think we are going to underestimate their focus so while waymo may and likely will win all the early battles by nature of them partnering with less successful companies like chrysler i think they will eventually fall behind to a gmford who can mass produce new age sdc hardwareinteriors with their already state of the artincredibly tight margin businesses they currently run i see the automakers winning this war guys

1358,do you have any sense for how long it will take for waymo to operate without safety drivers in their vans seeing the vans everyday around chandler im conflicted i both feel like the future is here and feel like were still years away seeing a safety driver in the drivers seat with hands on the wheel makes me feel like waymo will be no different than uber or lyft for a long while i do understand that it takes a lot to go from level to level autonomy but in the meantime its difficult to determine who is actually in the lead other than taking the companies word for it

1360,it is going to take a lot of resources plus it looks like waymo wants to do it fast it is why alphabet having b in cash in the bank and less than b debt is critical google has all that cash and yet will not do a dividend or any material buy backs suspect that is to get to scale as quickly as possible the law in california was just changed to not needing safety drivers but you can not offer commercially if that changes waymo can do california and cover an economy that is now bigger than the total of the uk waymo has k cars on order and they need a bigger area than just arizona to use that many cars imo but waymo needs to get to the infrastructure to add k cars a year this is a scale business and they need to get to scale quickly once they do it will be very difficult for anyone to compete with them

1364,waymo already does cars in arizona without safety drivers but they are rolling out the commercial service this year they also have k cars on order and then a deal with honda you do not buy cars to have them sit in a garage somewhere they also have worked out insurance munich re taking the risk maintenance with avis and then several other partnerships for the service

1366,as i type this waymo has cars driving around arizona without safety drivers so is sooo long as in months they also have k cars on order for the service think this is happening in a relatively short window of time they could very well run into issues and the roll out slowed but they have now done over million miles of testing in the physical world so be hard to imagine they would run into anything that would materially slow down the roll out now getting the service to say of the us population will take time and that could be easily years maybe even longer but suspect it will happen quicker than people are thinking

1372,i live and work in the center of where waymo is testing in arizona i havent seen a single car on the road without a safety driver i see a minimum of vans a day im also not convinced that the vans understand how to obey directions from a police officer for example when theres an accident and the police officer is redirecting traffic or when theres a traffic light out k order is a commitment to order not an actual order with a set delivery date from what ive read

1378,thats a good point but one problem with using high school grads is year olds are statistically much less safe drivers
1379,thats interesting thanks and a bit disappointing when you saw the line of cars and drivers waiting for a call were the drivers all sitting in the drivers seat i had hoped that waymo would be mostly driving around with safety drivers in the back seat by now which is what they announced late last year

1393,thanks i forgot i wanted to watch that part of google io i wonder if when they remove the safety drivers if they also need disable the steering wheels i cant imagine that waymo would risk a year old trying to see if they can make the van hit something

1395,guess because i am weird ha never had anyone say that before cruise went k miles in they do not have virtual world so zero virtual it is not about sucking anyones dick as you say it is just what the facts are how both waymo and gm and everyone but tesla is doing this it is a very manual development and miles driven has a linear relationship to where you are at in development obviously variety also plays a roll waymo far more variety and far more miles and so far ahead it is not complicated i am only talking the self driving tech aspect gm is way way more behind when you include all the other things needed for a commercial robot taxi service they do not have the digital infrastructure to support they do not have the human driving data which means cant make safe google knows what intersections people blow through with their google maps data and waze so can be more careful and avoid an accident where gm does not have that data just one example also why you see gm cars crash so much even with going so few miles
1396,i already read that article on le it focused on what happens if the waymo vehicle crashes i just read about the remote control stuff today im impressed but i still would like to see early riders in vans without safety drivers before i am convinced that waymo is light years ahead seems like im not the only one who doesnt believe were as far along as waymo tesla and others say driving ai winter full autonomy waymo tesla uber

1398,i would also love to see a third party video waymo claims they have removed the safety driver in at least some cars i have no reason to doubt them but it would be nice to see independent verification third party video may also give us a sense of the magnitude of waymos no safety driver efforts ie is it just a handful of cars or is it most of the fleet

1402,the average age of cars on the road in the us is years if fully autonomous sdcs are introduced in just a few years and it takes a few more for them to be widespread there will be dangerous morons behind the wheel for at least the next years it might not be your kids doing the driving but even a brilliant car is going to have trouble dodging someone driving drunk your kids kids yeah theyll probably be safe from cars
1403,as a parent of a and year old i would love this tech to keep my kids safe
1404,i did an informal survey of my engineering friends about years ago to a person not one of them would let any of their kids anywhere near an sdc the kids ranged in age from to and included parents of driving teenagers where they admitted their kids were a hazard to themselves and others on the road they tended to worry about really strange rare situations where they admitted that even if they were with the younger kid or if their older kid was driving the outcome was still essentially chance but they would rather they or their kid killed themselves rather than software for younger kids they imagined roving gangs of kidnappers despite being aware of the mind boggling low rate of this occurring now less than per year for older driving age kids they still worried about the kid being kidnapped because the kid couldnt steer the car to safety or something like that for all ages the fact that they were x more likely to result in the death of their kids than an sdc still didnt hold up because while they agreed with the premise statistically they thought that they in particular could have better odds the good news is that none of this matters economics will push people to sdcs and well reap the benefits

1409,as an engineer myself but you guessed that based on the fact i have a bunch of engineer friends i get the mentality completely ive engineered several semi sentient systems in my career and im still amazed how they react good and bad to real world circumstances that said i think even a large group of incompetent engineers could build a safe system compared to a human no one would want to use it but it would be safer apply a little market force and better engineers and you get both a system you would want to use and one at least as good as a human the good news is that every slightly qualified engineer in the field is being well compensated to work on the problem hopefully they are at least slightly above average

1413,i was once in a highway and driving confortably at the speed limit going into a wide curve the traffic was completely stopped i had a hard time stopping in a curve high speed but because i noticed there were cars behind me i had to stay on the break limits and stop immediatly behind the car ahead at point blank barely touching it and making sure to give maximum space for the car behind me this was a snap judgement ive made in a unique situation an auto would probably give way more safety distace and get rear ended

1415,true but every situation is different i think it will be a bit hard at the start but it will become statistically safer as more cars become selfdriving
1416,true but every situation is different i think it will be a bit hard at the start but it will become statistically safer as more cars become selfdriving
1417,it can happen if someone pulls out in front of you for example your choices might be to either hit his car or swerve to avoid it but in doing so hit people crossing the street a self driving car would need to be programmed to hit the car instead of veering into the people even though that is the safer option for the occupants i have seen plenty of examples of those situations just visit rroadcam

1419,a self driving car would need to be programmed to hit the car instead of veering into the people even though that is the safer option for the occupants why a human is under no moral obligation to hit the car in such a circumstance and risk greater injury to himself i dont want my car determining my life is worth less than someone elses

1421,why would it be sarcasm its virtually guaranteed that sdcs will be constantly barraged with bizarre incredible rube golsberg esque scenarios involving trolleys and levers and crowds of children and children shaped animals among which it must make strictly utilitarian murder plots in order to be anywhere near as safe as current manual vehicles
1422,your original question was that plowing into the people was safer for the occupants of the vehicle and im sticking to that in such a case what i would do is irrelevant what is moral is and in such a case its perfectly moral to react by plowing into the people to avoid collision also while ianal im not aware of any legal grounds for punishing a driver who makes such a choice to protect themselves

1424,a good thing this failure to recognize objects never happens with humans it happens all the time everybody acknowledges that sdc need to prove a significantly better driving record than humans before they are accepted after that all these hypothetical who do we choose to die situations are purely stupid because on the whole humans do a shitty job driving and frankly quite often making moral decisions furthermore computers in controlled situations gigaomcommicrosoft says its new computer vision system can outperform humans already recognize objects and persons faster and better than humans mediumcomthe physics arxiv blogthe face recognition algorithm that finally outperforms humans cadbffc again it has to be proven in sdc cars by a safety record

1426,it is machine it will fail there is no machine in existence which has not failed at something and i am not talking here about cars i am talking about machines in general beside the point the point is if machines fail less often than humans then we will end up favoring the machine human error is far more acceptable than machine error no both are unacceptable we prosecute humans all the time for manslaughter with cars who is at fault when the machine fails the manufacturer will be at fault they will defend their case with copious evidence that they were not at fault there are lots of sensors and therefore tons of evidence sdc will drive very defensively and i bet they can get it to the point where the liabilityrisk is worth the reward theyll probably carry liability insurance per the number of sdc carsmiles driven the cost of this insurance will drop as the number of safe miles driven piles up now having people killed because a smartass somewhere thought ill make it hit the smaller object is not an acceptable outcome in any situation again you might think youre awesome and not a smartass but i recommend you listen to the horror stories from people who have killed people on bikes or children who ran out into a road and tell me whether or not you think you can do better than them computers can and will do a better job driving than humans accidents involving machines that make their own decisions happen already with machines a lot dumber than these cars they will continue to happen all humans have to do is make sure the tradeoff between human decision making and computer decision is safe enough to try did you know that airplanes land themselves on a regular basis that in fact they land themselves in conditions that humans would find difficult http enwikipediaorgwikiautoland
1427,interesting bit about the saftey drivers its like your teenage child driving a bit rough and the parent wants them to stop however the child knows what he is doing even if its efficient fast and safe and is in no danger
1428,i mean they have driven well over a million miles without any accidents for which they were at fault with the majority of the accidents being rear ended at stop signslights true we dont know how many times an accident was avoided due to intervention by the safety driver but in those situations they analyze the cars data including what the car would have done if left alone they know if the car would have been in a wreck and if so the engineers address the behavior that would have caused it

1432,the minute these cars are only twice as dangerous as human cars id be legalizing them and allowing them to sell to the public saving millions of man hours of drivers time and freeing it up to work or play is worth that alone some vehicles on the road today are already half as safe as others so it isnt really any worse than allowing a few more trucks with shoddy brakes on the road as soon as they start exceeding human safety records id be looking into making the technology compulsory in new cars to save lives just like seatbelts crumple zones and airbags are compulsory today

1434,i feel like quietly is unnecessary in the headline what do other redditors think casual passer by i have not read the article edit having read the article i think its important for google to publish transparency reports at this time im a robotics engineer in silicon valley and i understand that self driving cars are a technology that can work but i also feel like its a matter of public safety that we know who is testing self driving vehicles on the road and what happens with them google has business interests here but we also have public safety to consider im not worried about public safety with google but i am worried about the newly funded start up that thinks they can be secretive even when their tech is experimental ive heard rumors of self driving car start ups that test highly experimental software on public roads google can set an example here if they choose

1436,i dont believe well see fsd reaching l and i dont think were going to see any of the av companies get to l for a very long time but for different reasons than your post i do see fsd reaching l on pre validated stretches of road ive been following fsd for about a year now and your write up today demonstrates progress months ago the typical post mortem reddit post would have listed far more safety disengagements on the same amount of mileage i dont feel that the non safety disengagements you listed are reasons to doubt fsds foundations standardized conditional speed limit signage and contextual hand gesture recognition are both within the realm of possibility to be programmed into a computer today my guess is that tesla has their efforts focused on more fundamental aspects of fsd that have more unknowns such as their vision only perception we do know that the perception engine is capable of perceiving unclassified obstacles in the road though the visualization doesnt show them anymore i do not know what kinds of work theyve done to be able to classify objects as being safe to drive over but again this isnt really an unsolvable problem and doesnt require human judgement so im not really convinced by your first or second point theyre fighting an uphill battle with their comically under powered sensor suite yet im impressed with how far theyve managed to get with it yes their vision only system does have a big error margin but it doesnt need to be tightened much further to make it suitable for a lot of driving i dont see fsd reaching l until they do the following fully embrace high fidelity mapping implement a teleguidance system that can loop a human in when human judgement is required double their compute power to offer full redundancy add sensor redundancy and improve sensor positioning however even if they do not do these things i feel that the system could one day be capable of l driving on pre validated roads particularly closed access roads and highways imo this would be great to have on a personally owned vehicle

1438,regarding the speed limits i think if and when autonomy is realized we will need a more foolproof machine readable way of indicating speed limits a localized broadcast a real time ota update a qr code on the signs something like that one of the big challenges with autonomous driving is we have to start at the hard end of the problem humans driving in a human world over time as there are fewer humans on the road the roads themselves can and will be equipped to aid the robot drivers to be more efficient and safer

1440,i wouldnt put much faith in the voxel map first the fact that its being built entirely from fairly low resolution images alone means its accuracy is at least moderately suspect from the beginning again great tech demoits impressive they can even do that much but its not enough when lives are at stake every demo ive seen including greens bears a pretty tenuous connection to the cars actual surroundings i might trust it to keep me away from curbs and other cars but certainly not to avoid a shards of broken glass for instance both the accuracy and spatial resolution are way too low second it doesnt change the ontological problem herethe system simply needs far more contextual understanding and common sense knowledge than it likely has to make intelligent inferences from what it sees whether its pixels voxels or both the system may know a flickering cluster of giant cubes is feet ahead of my bumper but what exactly does that mean is it safe or not this is a question about facts of the worldphysics materials causality etcnot mere geometry third even building a genuinely accurate voxel map would require more ontological awareness than the system appears to have in other words the process is circular just as it is in the human visual cortex we use depth cues to recognize the objects in front of us then use our understanding of those objects to refine and disambiguate those depth cues and repeat the process until we achieve a stable view of our surroundings the process doesnt just go in one direction so feeding in a rough pass of voxel estimation is only a first step many iterative steps remain hence i remain concerned teslas live in a dangerously cartoonish version of reality
1441,ah yeah interesting thanks for writing up your observations i enjoyed reading it i guess one thing to wonder is where you are in the distribution of drivers for instance if you are careful have a tesla and have a high safety score maybe you are in the top maybe even in the top of drivers i guess its interesting to think that maybe if youre like x better than average then a tesla could still be x better than the average driver and still worse than you if that makes sense which is a kind of weird way to think about it

1443,computers have exceeded humans in text reading for a while now only if you mean visual recognition of letters and words even large language models like gpt are nowhere near human level comprehension its best results are still largely cherry picked and it makes face palm inducing mistakes all the time nowhere near ready to safely navigate roads based on the text comprehension of signs and other safety indicatorswarningsetc

1445,remote operation would require a safety critical zero latency high bandwidth connection given the issues that the connected vehicle piece is having with dsrc then i dont think we will see such a capability for at least another decade if then insuring such remote operations would be a major issue surely much more efficient to just have some roving technicians a bit like the automobile association tow trucks that can turn up and resolve issues on the spot

1447,g networks have a round trip latency of about milliseconds you can buy hobby kits that allow one to pilot a drone or rc car over a g network over a video feed how safety critical it need be i suppose would depend on the nature of the intervention googles cars seem to get hung up in unusual situations like construction zones accident scenes or even chaotic parking lots places where a remote human operator doesnt need to go very fast at all to navigate the problem

1449,toyota is the least conservative among the japanese ones toyota is also pretty bold by investing heavily in sw recently almost like a transition to a tech company from what i see working for some of them japanese oems are not only more conservative but also take a bit different approach some of them rather see it as a safety feature also a japanese company would never release a half done solution like some of the us ones some of them have pretty good tech but also aware of the limitations and know it very well that full self driving is still very far on the other hand the smaller ones fall more and more behind because they dont have enough money to burn on massive rd projects

1451,well ive got no problem with that its a safety precaution and when a technology is as new and untested in the real world as a two tonne machine rolling past the public at up to mph without a human in charge it does a lot for the publics state of mind to require a human behind a steering wheel and presumably a foot hovering over the brake pedal too

1453,how about instead of simply requiring steering wheels and humans behind them we start thinking about legislation on how to safely remove them that would be acting like a leader in self driving technology and not just as a follower if we wait until the technology is ready then comes the question how do we know its actually ready what tests do we need what proof is convincing shouldnt we start trying to answer those questions before the technology is ready to avoid any unnecessary delay after all human driving kills people there is no lack of incentive in shortening the deployment of full autonomy
1454,youre right uber is at fault that doesnt mean sdc tech should be at fault this uber did not have technology that is safe for driving on its own on public roads it had incomplete unfinished technology and uber knows this therefore uber did not and has not deployed this technology thats why they were testing it so they can make it better this accident is due to human error and perhaps poor company practices
1455,this is the big opportunity aviation used to be quite dangerous relatively speaking but the ntsb and the accident investigation of every single plane incident has made flying the safest form of travel in or years self driving cars will be equally as safe
1456,look at all these people with opinions anout who is at fault its like nobody has heard about accident reviews or the systems in place to ensure air travel is safe no lets just engage in a witch hunt because everyone loves a good lynching get a grip people
1457,a technology operating at this level can simply be not be allowed to have failures this is not true sdcs can have lots of failures as long as they are safer on average than humans they are still worth using

1459,i think by the rules of the road if the uber was a human driver they would be ok this probably means they arent legally liable but they will no doubt pay a tidy settlement to make this go away the issue is that autonomous vehicles should be achieving a higher standard of safety not the legal minimum it might well set back their av program with the regulator

1461,i dont think your point of uber going into oblivion seems correct air accidents were common one day eg enmwikipediaorgwikiair_inter_flight_ but that didnt cause airbus to shut down we are today at a point where we dont have a regulatory body governing safety of self driving cars the creators of the technology should take responsibility rather than trying to get the matter to be forgotten

1465,i could see the argument if the testing is done on a closed trackcoursefacility but if the testing is done on public roads why would sae levels not apply the important distinction is that for l the car manufacturer is not responsible as you mentioned in this case its kinda moot because the safety driver was an uber employee i wonder if this accident will cause a shift in the industry where everyone fires their safety drivers creates a separate driver staffing company hires their drivers back and puts them back in the cars that way if another accident happens uber can say we are not responsible this was an l car it was being operated by a safety driver and we do not employ him you will have to talk to the staffing company rebu

1469,yeah most places in the world that have a the driver who rear ends other driver is at fault has a clause about the fact the braking must be done for safety or legal related reason people are jerks and someone somewhere and in the wrong day it might even be me tbh about it will cut you off just to get back at you for the fact that you did something that person didnt like at the wrong time

1471,the tesla would have kept a safety distance
1472,the tesla would have kept a safety distance
1473,i gave a broad answer because in the us is very state dependent and theres always the case of other countries which i have some but not much experience with for example ca is a partial fault state so the fact that you cut someone off as reckless driving doesnt reduce the fault of the person behind not keeping a safe distance and being unable to stop in time unless that cut in was done in a way that the driver behind was unable to keep such distance or in most south america countries where it is the driver in the back responsibility to prove the front one was reckless tldr this can get tricky and nuanced quickly very fast to the point it doesnt fit a reddit discussion but i agree with all you said depending on where in the world you are
1474,with proper safety distance as long as the tesla wasnt blinded by something else im pretty sure it would have had no issues stopping after all proper safety distance is the distance it takes you to react the distance it takes you to stop with much better response time of the computer compared to humans we should expect a self driving car to stop à few car lengths before the crash

1478,initially i can only see some highways bypasses or even just a separated lane on certain roads becoming sdc only to the benefit of safety and efficiency we might also see neighborhoods with specific ordinances or tax breaks encouraging homeowners to own and use sdcs i honestly cant see human driven cars going away completely for a very long time culture will preserve them for as long as they can be maintained or restored also great portions of rural and even urban areas arent marked or well maintained enough to accommodate the theoretical sdcs without controls owners of human driven vehicles will definitely push back against any new laws or government funded infrastructure that does not apply to them you know nimbyisms and such

1484,if autopilot fucked up and steered your car into another lane with a car in it tesla would absolutely be on the hook for that you cant release whatever bullshit garbage safety feature you want to and then walk away when it doesnt work my concern is that you would have a lot harder time saying suing a third party software company that was installed by you after the fact maybe you could do it but i have a hard time believing it would be just as easy as proving fault with an oem
