0,self driving cars are just another sign were living in an insane asylum run by the most dysfunctional inmates i dont believe that the technology will work anyway but buses trains and trams are already fine for getting people around and far simpler

2,i think its control the ultimate planned obsolescence product an electric self driving car a simple software glitch or update and the battery life falls off want to fix it it only costs the cost of a new car just buy a new car uncle sam loves it because he can finally tell you when you travel and when you dont uh oh you took part in a unapproved anti government protest freedom credits your car no longer functions i have yet to see a single smart bit of technology that actually worked for the person its always control consumption is control technology is not being used to free us its going to enslave us its always a product a service something you dont control on a related note somewhat the more i read into the quality of renewable fuels like ethanol and biodiesel the more oil seems like the biggest scam i have ever seen rockefeller backed temperance movements with millions to wipe out the ethanol industry his biggest competition the modern car is a money sink and it doesnt need to be designed to fall apart and get you to buy another i just want a simple repairable motor vehicle that i can run on homemade ethanol something i can fix it doesnt even need to be fast if i could i would go mph tops

4,self driving cars just one more thing not to buy nor pay any mind to its groundbreaking technology that could change the lives of a great number of people for the best we cant outright dismiss it i agree that the autonomous car jacking for money grabbing reasons is disgusting but there must be something we can do about it

6,i agree im not totally against the idea of a self driving car and i love the type of car service subscription you have described i just think it allows for the introduction of extraneous advertisements and serious drawbacks to the vehicles that might make me hesitant to use them if there was a service the way you described and they utilized it from the get go or even phased it in the way youtube ads have been for example i would be very hesitant to use the service not only is my psyche being manipulated so could my wallet or my waistline everyone is ultimately responsible for their own actions but imagine a lawsuit in which someone wants damages from the car service because it drove them by a mcdonalds every day since they liked it on facebook and their bank account shows a mcdonalds purchase x a week and now they gained a ton of weight and needed surgery it opens a lot of doors for too targeted advertising target and the pregnancy outing with their targeted ad and potential litigation were already bombarded with ads and have to try to use self control in some cases to avoid the impulse purchases to eat healthier etc why would we willingly engage any possible technology or features that could make it even harder to control

8,i think the deciding factor here is whether or not the route is actually optimal or if it wastes more gaselectricity getting you to your location if i drive past a mcdonalds everyday anyways whatever but i dont want an advertiser nudging me any more than they already do to buy buy buy i can make my own decisions on what route i want to take and why i can make my own decisions on what to splurge on and what not to at the end of the day even with this technology people still have the choice to go inspend or drive on by but advertisers are inching way too close to that line with this technology imo

10,and as soon as you grow the backbone to resist enough that its no longer profitable their algorithms will reflect that until then i cant really buy that you wouldnt have just gone there anyways im not for adverts in fact i spend a lot of several seconds getting applications to minimize them for me assuming that new tech is inherently bad because x is just as alarmist as every other bland non forward thinking person there is always a way around it even if it means direct payment or inputting your own rout directly its not a technology related issue its a service related one cue the bitching about internet providers

12,i think people are quick to become alarmist about new tech because their lives are already intruded upon by advertisers and big corps using data to predict purchases suggest products and learn who we are as consumers i think a lot of people myself included and definitely those who sub to ranticonsumption are those who are trying to actively decrease their spending or their need to buy a vehicle that uses this tech directly contradicts this philosophy its not about growing a backbone and i think thats kind of a rude way of putting it would you tell an alcoholic to grow a backbone as they drive by a bar or liquor store every night would you tell someone with an obesity problem to grow a backbone as they pass a cinnabon every morning before work those examples arent perfect because anticonsumption isnt a disease in the way those are but its the same idea if you want to spend less you actively try to remove factors in your life that would promote or encourage consumption less stops at the gas station or target using adblocker skipping commercials using dvr reducing the amount of television watched and in this case actively avoiding routes that could cause your budget to go out of flux when your car suggests something that you dont really need also on the tech side who is to say that the algorithm would change if you decline to visit the storerestaurant it suggests from the article it could be that drivers and passengers can instruct cars to avoid certain destinations putting aside the question of why we should be imposed upon like this at all if the car were to drive to those verboten destinations anyway thats probably wrong recall in isaac asimovs novels that the second law of robotics is to always obey human orders where they dont violate the first rule to not cause or allow harm to humans however resisting humans is a major point of autonomous cars we humans are often error prone and reckless while algorithms and unblinking sensors can physically drive better than us in most if not all cases an automated vehicle is designed precisely to disregard our orders where they are imminently risky thats to say refusing human orders is sometimes a feature not a bug its unclear then whether opting out of certain destinations or opting in is reason enough for cars to comply with those commands
13,no i would never support a ban of non autonomous vehicles there will always be people who are not comfortable with the technology plus it is extremely unlikely the technology will be accident proof in our lifetimes or even before or possibly after the technology would have to be absolutely accident and failure free before anyone jumps in with of course it will be safe by xxxx year you need to go back and look at the things predicted to be commonplace now that arent here yet or even coming along anytime soon

15,driving a car is probably the least free and most uniformly regulated of all activities on the planet no matter how liberal or conservative the jurisdiction its an interesting matter for practical technological discussion but to anyone who steps up and says what about my rights my only question is what rock have they been under all their lives

17,freedom inherently comes with risks some safety measures should just be encouraged not enforced i mean it would technically be in the publics best interest to stay home all day and never interact with strangers but a free society is always going to be vulnerable to dangers and the effects of bad decision making
18,honestly i would like to see this once the technology is there maybe have autonomous vehicles only on the main highways and leave the side streets and things of that nature to regular vehicles

20,no just like other safety features and designs three point seatbelts airbags sloping hoods so pedestrians go over the vehicle instead of under it in the event of a collision etc the change will occur naturally over time that technology is still long way off and even when its finally arrived it will be expensive to implement a total ban on vehicles that dont incorporate the technology would present an undue burden on the public since most people wouldnt be able to afford the switch immediately but sooner or later just like backup cameras it will become a standard feature of all vehicles even economy ones so as time progresses all cars will naturally be autonomous unless youre suggesting the government implement a massive trade in so that every american gets one for free but even then that would probably just create a monopoly for whichever company creates the technology first which would also be bad also until true ai is a thing even autonomous vehicles will require manual driving for lots of things rural areas would be particularly hard hit by such a ban since the technology as its currently progressing only works well in urban and suburban environments anyone who drives long distances on the regular will tell you how often gps will drop when youre out in the boonies

22,i think the onus is the expectation that non autonomous vehicles will always function and perform perfectly technology is prone to glitches and failure rates do i think that non autonomous vehicles that never crash or cause injury are ideal of course but we dont live in a utopian society and i dont believe this technology will exist in our lifetime

24,exactly but the cross over period were entering it now where autonomous vehicles and driven cars share the road im wondering how long that will last i imagine once the tech is good enough and new cars start to come with self driving features itll just be a matter of years i could imagine autonomous vehicles by and then by it being very rare to see someone driving or people just driving for fun im probably off on my timeline but curious what others foresee
25,i mean it would technically be in the publics best interest to stay home all day and never interact with strangers thats a very different riskbenefit calculation than the one that is the the topic of this article american were killed by cars in in my estimation whatever jollies people get from being behind the wheel arent worth a single one of those lives
26,what about the freedom of someone to drive a car they can fix themselves id imagine a lot of technology in self driving cars is proprietary and would stop people from having the ability to take personal responsibility of their own property or even have the liberty to use it on public roads

28,i dont think it would be acceptable to ban one form of transport for safety reasons for another that was not safe in addition if its between someone being able to get around or not because they dont trust the technology then they should be able to drive themselves comfort has always outweighed lives saved approximately million people are killed in fatal crashes each year on average thats about deaths a day globally an additional million are injured or accident statistics no one has banned cars yet

30,thats a fair point to raise but its still an arbitrary point to place a line in the sand it has less to do with legal freedom but most people already have no freedom mentally or physically to cross the sea most have to rely upon technology or professionals to make that trip why draw the line there on how farwhere you can travel without the reliance on others the easiest place to draw the line truly is with walkingbiking if you have the need to travel great distances thats going to require some level of sacrifice no matter how you look at it also more specifically addressing your concern we already do not have the liberty to use any old vehicle on public roads in many places it has to meet certain standards and its tested periodically according to those standards emissions safety etc a transition to autonomous is just one additional rung up the ladder you might not be okay with that but to me its very arbitrary and i disagree that its a concern for the losses that well experience we will gain just as many benefits with a transition to autonomous

32,in addition if its between someone being able to get around or not because they dont trust the technology then they should be able to drive themselves what if i dont trust you to drive yourself can i be able to have the technology drive you instead comfort has always outweighed lives saved approximately million people are killed in fatal crashes each year on average thats about deaths a day globally an additional million are injured or disabled no one has banned cars yet yeah thats objectively bonkers excuse me for not wanting to sacrifice myself so you can operate your cool toy

34,we dont because its too burdensome to subject people to that level of liability just so they can get around but if we had reliable autonomous driving tech people who choose not to use are volunteering for that liability
35,ok what about the what about the rights of your fellow street users what about my right to cross the street without worrying if the car approaching is going to stop at that stop sign or the right not to be bullied to yield at an intersection when i actually have the right of way thats why traffic laws and drivers licenses exist an individuals right to drive should not be taken away for the general publics right to comfort neither are protected rights technically good drivers should not lose autonomy over their vehicle because bad drivers exist public safety should be protected through better training of drivers and stricter enforcement of preexisting laws not loss of rightsprivileges for those following the law
36,dont generally worry about those things now anymore than i worry about buildings collapsing on me when i walk down the street we have laws signage and licensing for a reason we also teach our children to watch out for cars i worry about these things all the time because i live in a city where everyone drives like a raging psycho and routinely run down pedestrians without anyone being held accountable what i do worry about is my and my familys safety in the event of the failure of any one of the hundreds of systems required for autonomous driving clearly the technology is not there yet in terms of reliability but we will get there in any event non autonomous cars break too i worry that if the cascadia quake hits and cell service goes out then i cant get anywhere in my truck be it to get supplies like water or to get my family to our trailer an emergency manual failsafe would almost be the easiest thing in the world to include

38,thats why traffic laws and drivers licenses exist yes they do a piss poor job but theyre what we have for now when something better comes along we should do that an individuals right to drive should not be taken away for the general publics right to comfort neither are protected rights technically neither is the right to drive thats why you need a license to do it good drivers should not lose autonomy over their vehicle because bad drivers exist why not why should people be entitled to endanger others when a safer way exists public safety should be protected through better training of drivers and stricter enforcement of preexisting laws not loss of rightsprivileges for those following the law well if that worked then we wouldnt be having this discussion
39,yet americans were killed by cars in if the technology gets to the point where it allows us to take a huge chunk out of that number perhaps virtually all of it we should do it and if you lived where i do youd wonder about those drunk year olds

41,by virtue of the technology existing it will take a huge chunk out of that number anyway we dont have to expand government control to police the small minority of people who enjoy driving the old fashioned way

43,depends on in what sense you are referring to lidar pollution there will be no visible effect due to the lasers being in the infrared wavelength range if you mean will there be crosstalk or interference from other nearby lidars in a crowded area that is a possibility but there are methods to get around that issue one way is to use coherent scanning technology which allows the unit to send out a series of pulses with a specific signature encoded into it that the detector can check for when it receives a signal in that way the signals from other nearby lidars wont cause the unit to register false returns

45,those types of techniques can certainly reduce the incidence of false positives but in situations with enough vehicles and specular reflective surfaces your system can easily have very low confidence i used to work with vector templating system that can auto align using lasers and retro reflective material and even with all the tricks we lock out the ability to align two heads at the same time that are too close together these types of visual systems are very sensitive to interference i mean i worked on systems that needed thou accuracy on stationery mounts but i can certainly see a half dozen lidar scanners in very close proximity causing enough interference to atleast lower the confidence enough to make them significantly less reliable not to mention due to the fact that if a company wanted to use visible light lasers for improved range eyesafe and r systems are still incredibly distance limited for dynamically mounted sensors generally use at least other machine vision technology is needed to have adequate active track most of the vehicles that i have seen equipped with lidar systems are also using or other additional methods like machine vision with cameras and actual radar there is a reason we dont see automotive lidar on vehicles outside of experimental self driving applications and close to the ground warehouse autos controlled by a single server or coordinated through a hivemind iot architecture that is also supported by a server teslas decision to forgo lidar altogether didnt happen by accident its far easier to coordinate disparate devices when the scanners you are using arent emitters

47,it is really only a problem for generating false positives in other cars lidars so the technology making it safe for autonomous cars to drive makes it unsafer for other autonomous cars seems like a fatal design flaw

49,nobody knows there are too many lifeforms on the planet to test lidar wifi bluetooth and any other kind of em radiation on all of them and in all the possible permutations of intensity and frequency of exposure i am far from convinced that these technologies are harmless every time we implement a technology like this on a massive scale it is a bit of a gamble it seems a bit reckless to assume that life which depends on quantum scale phenomena is unaffected by lidar and other em radiation technologies

51,the infrared spectrum is massive most ir based sensors such as lidar or household motion detectors do not operate at the thermal level even night vision gogglesfilters are not operating at the thermal level theyre slightly outside the visible spectrum and can pick upshow more light than what is available but in no way are picking up heat signatures in fact night vision requires some ambient light andor an ir floodlight to work this is in stark contrast to longer wavelength thermal ir that actually picks up heat signature in turn some animals do see into the ir spectrum and they do not have to worry about heat energy distorting anything tldr ir does not mean thermal and in terms of modern tech refers to the part of the infrared spectrum thats right past what humans can see
52,i work on the radar version we use a few techniques to mitigate interference one simple one is to randomly hop between frequencies if you have say khz of bandwidth that you can split into hz steps thats frequencies if you randomly hop between them the chances that another sensor will happen to intersect for say consecutive transmission periods becomes tiny you were going to average across many transmissions anyway to average your way through noise and so on so its a cheap way to become robust by the way ive heard that manufacturers used to bring their devices to conferences so that everybody could test interference mitigation against one another doesnt seem to happen any more at least for automotive radar
53,what happens when someone intent on malicious behavior decides to actively jam the entire range it seems that with so much focus on making the technology work not a lot of focus is placed on making it so people cant easily interfere with it in decidedly evil ways

55,cheap cordless phones use this technology these days frequency hoping were exotic stuff back in the sixties not so much now
56,cheap cordless phones use this technology these days frequency hoping were exotic stuff back in the sixties not so much now
57,you could simply give each car a different random number generator for the frequency jumps in case you are not familiar computers cannot generate actually random numbers instead we use a pseudo random number generator essentially we take some rapidly changing input often we use the system time measured in milliseconds from some time in the i think s look up unix time if you want specifics then pass that through an algorithm that creates a random looking output there are standards for what qualifies as a random looking output but essentially output must be evenly distributed on some range and not correlated in an obvious way to inputs ie inputs close in value do not necessarily yield outputs close in value or predictably separated these pseudo random number generation algorithms can generally take what is called a seed that is used in the calculation this seed basically consists of some data so it could be anything from an integer to a sentence or anything else the number generation algorithm just views it as some binary data and can usually use a seed of any length because this seed is used in the calculation each unique seed will generate a unique sequence of outputs so to get back to the point if each car uses a different seed its vin number for example in its random number generator for jumping frequencies you would be guaranteed that no two cars would ever generate the same sequence of numbers of course this does not technically guarantee that they wont generate the same outputs for some finite amount of time say outputs in a row but it makes the chances even smaller than before and guarantees that they would not generate the same output indefinitely
58,ive heard of that technique before and i could swear it was called synthetic aperture radar but a quick wiki search reveals thats something else the closest i could find was this http enmwikipediaorgwikifm cw_radarmodulated_continuous wave which makes no mention of using it to combat interference weird
59,most modern rf technologies use techniques such as dsss http enmwikipediaorgwikidirect sequence_spread_spectrum to mitigate interference its incredibly hard to outright jam usually the range andor bandwidth is just reduced in the presence of interference
60,it transmits to both cars but its understood or accepted only by the one who has proper code for that remote thats why you cant just buy remote but you have to pair it to your car by technician

63,i think youre correct it probably isnt worth it to completely eliminate the chance since its so small but its interesting to think about how a solution would be implemented how much would it cost compared to the actual system and it would be worth it at all then again there could be ways to use that technology the one im proposing not the one they currently use maliciously probably have a device that tells the car im using all these frequencies except this one then the car is forced to use that single frequency then the malicious car could jam that frequency and blind the victim potentially causing an accident if no other security measures are in place for such an eventuality

65,i dont think its ever been used to combat interference but theoretically it could be used for that i dunno did i just invent a new radar interference avoidance technique
66,i dont know how much of it is applicable to what youre doing but you might get some neat tricks out of studying the history of electronic warfare i took a class at georgia tech a few years ago fascinating stuff
67,im a tech at the service center in marysville yes the car will keep itself in the lane on a straight road if you dont have your hands on the wheel for more than sec it will beep at you if you continue to keep your hands off the wheel it will suspend the lane keep assist the acc system will bring the car down to mph with the brakes but will then cancel below that speedacura has low speed follow the collision mitigation braking system will help lower the severity of a crash but it wont prevent it if the cmb system has to step in youre going to hit something
68,glad i can help the class i took was a week long so it wasnt too time consuming i believe this is the class i took pegatecheducoursesbasic rf electronic warfare concepts
69,thank you for doing this i was wondering if you could discuss a little about how algorithms and ai affect politics and how politics affect aialgorithms i am interested in both how they affect political races as well as public opinion on policy do you believe that there needs to be new ruleslawsetc to restrict what algorithms are allowed to interact with or would that be impossible to create bonus question if you have time what are ways that regular people who do not have huge understandings of technologyaialgorithms can combat the biases that these algorithms can generate

71,most people are afraid of a robot apocalypse or the terminator scenario as someone who has a much better understanding of algorithms and ai do you think countries need to tightly regulator how these new ai systems are developed and deployed i know oftentimes regulations are outpaced by technology but this seems like an especially dangerous proposition in the case of ai xb xb

73,i hear a lot of fear mongering and complaints about algorithms and ai in the press but few solutions i think the problem is solvable we dont want to create excessive algo skepticism some level of caution is warranted but too much fear mongering i do believe we can control how ai will impact us we need a number of checks and balances in place i proposed a bill of rights in my book for the same the main pillars are listed below in response to a later answer transparency audits user control etc also if we are going to reject algo decisions we should ask whats teh alternative humans are highly error prone as well heres what i say in my book i say that the biggest cause for concern in my opinion is not that algorithms have biases humans do too and on average well designed algorithms are less biased but that we are more susceptible to biases in algorithms than in humans because algorithms deployed by large tech platforms like google and facebook instantaneously touch billions of people the scale of their impact exceeds any damage that can be caused by biases introduced by human decision makers meaning that a biased judge might affect the lives of say people but a biased algorithm used to guide sentencing decisions of judges all over the us will affect the lives of several hundred thousands of people so i believe we should raise the bar a bit more for algos than for humans when deploying them in socially critical settings subject them to an audit by a team other than the one that built the ai then deploy them while i say we should raise the bar i am against some fear mongering going on in fact in an article i argued that i would argue that its not acceptable to reject todays ai due to perceived ethical issues why ironically i believe it might be unethical to do so at its core there is a meta ethics issue here how can we advocate halting the deployment of a technology solely because of a small chance of failure when we know that ai technologies harnessed today could definitely save millions of people see more about this viewpoint here dilemmas must not halt the rollout of ai

77,i do believe that agi will happen sooner than most lay people believe but slower than many technologists believe that is to say within the next years in terms of what happens after we have possibilities agi does everything we could come up with and theres no point in us even trying want to cure cancer if feasible agi will beat you to it so we live well as a result agi takes control and acts in ways we hadnt anticipated many people have expressed worries about this personally i belong to neither camp i think we will have many challenges with ai in the next years those ill hopefully result in lots of safeguards being put in place we will likely live in fear that we might lose control but that fear will alone cause many checks and balances to be put in but i do agree with elon musk and many others who were involved in the famous open letter on ai that the concerns are real enwikipediaorgwikiopen_letter_on_artificial_intelligence i am optimistic well do the right things along the way to just about keep it under check
78,recommendations on amzn spotify netflix speech recognition applications like alexa google voice smart replies in gmail spam filtering and email organizing features in gmail outlook auto pilot features in a plane much of the automation eg lane control available in cars today autocomplete suggestions in google search there are lots of other technologies that we might no longer consider as ai but would have been considered so previously in fact theres this famous quote usually attributed to computer scientist john mccarthy as soon as it works no one calls it ai any more
79,i am somewhere in between i use technology a lot but i have limited what kinds of data technology will have access to i dont discuss politics on social media or share deeply personal things on it i do use fb to follow what friends are up to and to share things id feel comfortable sharing with large groups i use twitter li solely for media consumption or professional posts i use the incognito mode when i am worried about confidentiality i do have alexa but wont use it in my bedroom i experimented with creating a smart home connected tv bulbs thermostats etc but concluded that the benefits werent worth it for me i no longer use it i am not saying any of these are right for you or anyone else but my overall take is that we cant live as tech luddites we should embrace technological progress but we should understand how they work and what can go wrong and we should draw a line somewhere that line might be at different places for different people but we shouldnt just passively use these systems without any deliberate consideration of pros cons

82,im of the view that while individual effort alone will not solve this problem we actually do have some amount of power here and that power is in the form of our knowledge our votes and our dollars in terms of knowledge the idea is somewhat straightforward but i think its under appreciated which is becoming aware of the technologies were using and whats happening behind the scenes with them instead of being very passive users of technologies and algorithms more deliberate choices should be made we have to ask ourselves how algorithms change the decisions were making or that others are making about us if you look at what facebook is doing they announced changes to their products how theyre going to support encryption of messages and support short lived posts that disappear afetr some time i think thats a direct outcome of pushback from users the other is our votes and basically backing representatives who understand the nuances here and who take consumer protection seriously in just the last year or two there have been a number of us senators and representatives who proposed bills related to privacy and algorithm bias and so on and being aware of whos doing what in the voting decisions and finally with dollars the idea is vote with your wallet we ultimately have the option to walk away from these tools so if we feel like a company is using our data and we dont find it acceptable for some people that might be where they draw the line and walk away all that said i think individual action wont suffice tech firms have to cooperate and regulators need to push them to do so without going overboard with regulation
83,i havent seen a full season i did see a couple episodes in fact i use the following quote to begin a chapter in my book that focuses on how many of our choices are driven by algorithms if you did consider your choices youd be confronted with a truth you cannot comprehend that no choice you ever made has been your own youve always been a prisoner what if i told you im here to set you free the man in black in westworld season episode more generally i think the science fiction writers and engineers influence each other in many ways writers see the latest engineering marvels and let their imaginations go wild in terms of where that might lead us engineers see some of the technology dreamed up by sci fi writers and get inspired to come up with new ideas its very interesting

85,without any doubt in my mind its a fundamental shift in technology just like internet mobile and cloud computing have been modern ai based algorithms are here to stay advanced algorithms deployed in medical diagnostic systems will save lives advanced algorithms deployed in driverless cars can reduce accidents and fatalities advanced algorithms deployed in finance can lower the fees we all pay to invest our savings but we will have many growing pains along the way driverless car fatalities algorithm bias trading algorithms messing up etc but to discard them now would be like stone age man deciding to reject the use of fire because it can be tricky to control so the question is how do we manage them in the long run

91,sure there is potential for abuse but the same is true of any new technology you could also say that cars themselves are a danger because they move so much faster than horse drawn carriages people will die from problems with driver less cars the question is will more lives be saved overall from the safety improvements i would say yes

95,i do not know the exact design of the lidars but from my experience as an etew tech for the coast guard s technology goddamn piece of shit that the detector was could be used to specifically identify an individual ship radars are unique enough despite mass manufacture of the same model and parts that it was as good as a fingerprint at this point making sure you can identify yourself from a sea of noise should be so trivial that it would be included automatically in any radarlidar system i would be very surprised if it was not already built this way

99,i see your point for overall safety and agree to an extent unfortunately it will take the lives of those whom befall the shortcomings of our trust in this technology to bear out the eventual statistical answer perhaps we should look instead at this technology as a better mass transit solution rather than individual owner option let that be the litmus test before we go full into this commercial automata that would also give the brunt of the infrastructure build and design on the local government vs the individual consumer having to flesh this thing out sorry i ramble

101,the first approach in every situation of what is there to stop a person from severely annoying or endangering others is laws that say you must not well make it illegal to send false signals between driverless cars in most areas of life this is completely sufficient of people see it as socially unacceptable to break laws are sufficiently put off by the danger of getting caught to attempt breaking laws and the rest are hopefully caught and punished after the fact numbers made up on the spot for example there is nothing stopping me from punching a random stranger in the face tomorrow but i dont want to i wont because its wrong and i dont want to go to jail there is nothing stopping me from driving drunk and crashing into oncoming traffic tomorrow except not wanting to and not wanting to go to jail computer scientists often forget about laws and social rules as a substitute for technology because on the internet its very difficult to enforce laws breaking into computers without permission is illegal but if the criminals are half a world away it does not work in practice if it is reasonably possible to catch the false signal senders after the fact just a law is sufficient protection and no complex technology is required

103,its also important to note that ptc cant override the laws of physics if a truck gets stuck on tracks at a crossing and a train doesnt have time to stop a crash will still happen thats weird since the technology for that exists and is used on german bullet train tracks http honeywellcomsitesaero regelsystemeproduktesdocumentsrs_e_pdf still great to hear that america is finally prioritizing train safety

113,thats not how id imagine a fully self driving car system based on how early the technology id expect the cars to either be equidistant or much tighter packed in few lanes equidistant would make it impossible to transverse a road as cars would seemingly always be pretty close as the tech ages id expect the gaps to shrink and see long and tight lines of cars in fewer lanes to reduce infrastructure cost personally i believe in a car free city model but the way zoning in the us is done i could never see a truly car free society without the need of mass migration i dont see people migrating but if you took the top sized us cities and make them no longer expand in size and fill in the gaps to increase density a car free city would be great would also free up a bunch of land in cities that were previously parking lots would give rural people the ability to travel that is not solvable in mass transit

115,this was peak dumbass when people started believing this shit was possible ok so your plan is to replace cars and service vehicles with tech that remotely doesnt exist mind you despite your highway auto features you think are even close this level and make sure they can all reliable communicate with each other and a new grid and all software companies will play fair and every car owner will keep up maintenance to for community integrity and thats just to start i have an idea for an electric vehicle that can use less space carry way more people and still get you where you want to go safer and more efficiently than this dystopia you imagine choo choo choo mother fuckers choo choo choo
116,to be fair if we are talking about a future where technology has progressed this far it wouldnt be much of a reach that one could integrate a system where pedestrians can hit a button which would send a signal to all cars at the intersection to stop and allow them to pass not advocating for this just spitballing an idea

121,obviously elons boring technology were gonna be under the road the surface is for robotsai not humans
122,yet we have millions of software bugs humans driving every day no good answers with cars besides making the roads accessable to all did everyone notice in that tweet thread that elon admitted to traffic going up immensely when ai takes the wheel this day was coming all auto makers are spending billions to develop this tech and if you had recognized the trend in auto safety systems ai is just the next logical step to vehicle safety my hope is that more people will value being outside of the car and get enough support to make our public roads equitable to all users this will be independent of whatever cars are doing because the safety standards will be looked at outside of the driver seat and at the most vulnerable peds bikes kids playing unfortunately ill be dead before i see meaningful change in this maybe my kids will enjoy it though
123,actually this would be a good thing because a lot of traffic and air pollution from cars is caused by idle times which this system would reduce it would be easy to factor in pedestrian road crossings only unlike at a conventional intersection where all the cars perpendicular to the direction of crossing must stop it would be possible to slow and stop the cars near the pedestrian that would cross their path india accomplishes this without technology

125,since we have no clue how cognition ie the abilty to think and reason works in a biological brain we have no ability to create machines that have that ability either deep learning algorithms and neural network software do not and cannot have this ability regardless of how much training data you throw at it a child knows the difference between a real stop sign and a stop sign on someones clothing they also know that a stop sign is still a stop sign even if it has a sticker or some graffitti on it these so called improperly named ais do not know the difference furthermore any so called self driving car that has to randomly pull over to the side of the road and stop then call a remote human operator to guide it manually through whatever it is it cant handle is not in any way shape or form ready to be responsible for the safety of human occupants or be allowed on public roads its all a failed technology that will never be ready for real world use these companies all know this but have invested so much money in the development that they insist on marketing it anyway to recover that money or go bankrupt dont fall for the self driving car meme

131,if youve ever flown youre software bug away from death also cross as normal except now you have an algorithm that reacts to your pushing the cross button at the crosswalk and pauses the merge sequence halting all traffic so you can cross safely then resumes like what the fuck i hate tech bullshittery when i see it but for ffs these are easy fixes and implements yall are worse than rthathappened
132,this is the elon musk stupid approach come up with something stupidly inefficient and not trully feasible in the current times wrap it with futuristic tech shit and make every one neuron human being in the world shit himself thinking how good and mind blowing the idea is you know what would also help traffic in this exact situation and would get rid of traffic lights something invented years ago a roundabout
133,there was a guy down in mexico city at the unam who tested some accident preventing tech in mini cars and it made them virtually accident proof this was more than a decade ago i am sure today it is even safer the problem is the one person who refuses to let anything else drive their car
134,idk a bridge ancient tech
135,why do people think technology never malfunctions
136,why do people think technology never malfunctions
137,more so your brain on silicon valley techbro culture i work in tech im so sick of naive young developers that dont understand you cant solve everything with more software or that just because they understand software doesnt mean they know shit about other domains or that you know how to evaluate externalities the entire self driving car idea is a prime example of this truly self driving vehicles that work with no fallback on unmodified roads is unlikely to be approved anytime soon for good reason the edge cases are a way harder problem than the tech sector will admit and while some safety features driven by that tech are legitimately good ideas eg auto braking too much incomplete automation risks dangerous complacency by human drivers that are already overly distracted as it is particularly since it will fail in precisely the worst case scenarios
138,nah people with disabilities and people that cant afford to buy self driving cars dont exist or shouldnt the tech bro that came up with the original post probably
139,if this was ever implemented in a way that pedestrians had right of way and was safe id just do laps of the intersection on foot out of spite that we have this level of technology and this was the implementation we went with

142,yeah i love cgp greys content but that video was a huge swing and a miss complete carbrained nonsense he has a bit of a new shiny technology will solve all our problems complex
143,even the ones in the turning lane this isnt just a techbro fantasy it creates problems that weve already solved in real life
144,its so insane how many of the tech bro solutions are just equivalent to trains with downsides that trains wouldnt have
145,cgp grey is one of those guys thats finds hyper technological and complicated solutions fascinating its a cool thought experiment but there are dumber solutions which are much more practical

147,the past isnt the future it just that they got it right back then like how we still use some technology that are just hundreds of year old like making beer same basic technique for hundreds of years

149,i feel like most computer engineers should take a mandatory civil engineering course as a requirement for their degree to prevent stupid more computer mean more gooder solutions frame anything as cutting edge technology and theyll buy into it as the sole solution to a hundred year old problem they just learned about then when the hyperloop gets traffic jams its just a prototype theyll develop more loops to fix it despite the fact that didnt work for highways because thats not how traffic works

151,exactly we dont need new tech to come and save us we have everything we need for a better future right here right now
152,you think a garage is not taking space in a city i was specifically referencing the idea that car sharing would mean less cars on the road you know like what i quoted also how i said isnt clogging up the roads should have been enough there right citation needed you wont find a citation for this because its an opinion based on observation not a studied fact see uberscabs in cities now thats technically the same as an autonomous car that is used by many it just has a manual driver for now have we seen less traffic with the introduction of these services it doesnt seem like it feel free to refute this properly with your own citations but im just having a conversation not writing a paper if anything they help reducing traffic missing the point they introduced a massive amount of these things because as a company you want them to always be available the same will be true of any company pushing out a fleet of autonomous vehicles designed to arrive to your home quickly the service will fail if people miss their appointments due to waiting on a car to be available i wasnt commenting on whether the scooters reduced traffic or not
153,theyre still technically independent as they make their decisions themselves even if they communicate with others to reach it and to tell them what they will do theres no central system deciding what the cars do
154,no one thing will save us we need a diversified approach to transportation to provide people with options the main issue was looking for that one technology to solve everything currently that is the car this type of thinking is bad for most problem solving in general the car is a particular technology that is good for traveling outwards to a particular spot that no one else is the original idea was imagined as flying through space on a freeway not sitting in traffic we currently use it to converge all on the same point at the same time like hammering in a screw we need diversified options that are all equally viable having one technology was optimal for moving wealth from the public into few private uncountable hands diversification is a long term planning where as profit driven thinking favours short term reactionary thinking or lack of thinking we know what needs to be done and have so for the past years the issue is that there are forces actively trying to stop that from happening in order to continue gaining profit moving it from the many towards the few the latest example is elon musk if people are really engineer types and really interested in efficiencies then look no further than the bike the most efficient machine ever created for transportation it stands alone nothing even comes close i know i am preaching to the choir here but yes love you guys this sub is great

156,polluting car batteries too ive got nothing against battery powered trams or even buses since they are being used for years almost everyday continuously from am to pm in most cities but for cars its not like we have a clean way of making those batteries i know we can just use normal tramways with over head wire but some cities have incredible architecture and putting cables there would be a shame if the technology convinces more municipalities to build tramway then it should be used

160,brake dust is still an issue for electric vehicles but it should be noted that with ai managed traffic and regenerative braking which doesnt use the brake pads it can be mitigated to a tremendous degree regenerative braking works best when decelerating slower allowing the wheels the magnetically induce a current in the electric motors which is then funneled into the battery get cars out of the city anyway because they arent necessary with proper public transit but the technology is still going to end up being incredibly useful even for rail which could use the same tech to recapture the expended energy doesnt apply to tire wear and tear thats still a huge issue if youre wondering what ai has to do with it and want to think it through stop reading here ill add it below ai can communicate with other vehicles and calculate the optimum time to start decelerating using regenerative braking in order to utilize brake pads as little as possible still even so cars in cities are still a huge problem even if the brake dust thing was entirely solvable i just wanted to add that theres anti car uses for the technology

162,yes the car is a specific technology with specific uses currently we use it for far more than it is useful for and the consequences are very detrimental to society not to mention the environment as per your example in communities where people cycle more the elderly have greater mobility later on in life because they lead more active lifestyles and because they are able to ride a bike safely in old age and not endanger others as with an automobile of course for those who are not able to walk or ride there are other options but these modes can function better because roads are occupied only with those functions that are deemed most necessary optimal for that specific mode and not clogged up

164,yeah well why people dont just quit eating meat too and not exchange it with vegan alternatives which still look and smell like meat i know co is not the only bad thing of cars but its one of the most important one for our future as an electrical engineer i am kind of tired of the argument that electronical cars wont solve anything true but we need to start somehow damn it politicians and even voters for example in switzerland block everything which can make people less rich also funding of better ideas is nearly non existent compared to military or other stuff and the lobbies make it impossible to switch the system you people cannot just think there will be one technology solving all

166,i think we as a society generally overestimate the issues with point source pollution like mining and grossly underestimate the threat of distributed pollution like climate change thats not to say that evs are perfect they are not but if were not ready to give up cars completely as a society and were not all cars that do exist should be evs its also worth noting that battery technologies will be a part of decarbonization of the grid too so any issues with ev batteries will also apply to grid storage
167,nothing is recyclable really we are too focused on recycling there is nothing wrong in principle with landfilling things especially plastic properly disposed of in a landfill it will sit mostly inert and not cause any serious problems yes there could be some sort of natural disaster that releases it but a natural disaster could also release untapped oil resources if we decided to leave it in the ground really processing oil into plastic etc makes it less toxic in a sense im not arguing we should process all the oil in the world just saying that garbage is overrated as an environmental problem its important that we keep the carbon cycle good and we avoid releasing free toxins into the atmosphere water etc we should use whatever technology best does that and its clear that batteries are better than petroleum as a rule

169,or we could just have trains yeah i know which is why part of my point was literally to say the technology is still going to end up being incredibly useful even for rail which could use the same tech to recapture the expended energy smart traffic management has uses beyond just cars like rail examining the number of people waiting having people state where theyre going dynamically allocating trains to provide additional transit as necessary and automatically slowing down certain trains by a couple minutes in order to alleviate congestion in stations

171,resources and reserves are different you said reserves reserves are a commodity that can be economically extracted just because those resources are documented does not mean it can ever be extractable lithium reserves are the volume of lithium that can be economically mined from those reserves often they have a small recovery percentage of the million tones is a very generous number of what is possible to mine and extract direct leaching using a hcl solution resulted in less than lithium recovery which was due to nearly of the lithium being associated with insoluble solids as determined by the results from a detailed sequential extraction test even oil keep in mind it often can only have a recovery factor for primary recovery for a breakdown using oil you could have million barrels of oil resources of that you can economically produce from a reservoir of million barrels from that you will have a recovery factor so you may make million barrels for that field as a simple math example thats why the number on reserves and recoverable reserves changes so much reserves is reliant on prices and how much extraction costs are recoverability is dependent on technology as it stands lithium ore has a poor recovery rate i cite an example above

173,ill make sure to send them an edit suggestion theyre using the definition of reserves and resources incorrectly by using them interchangeably there are billion tonnes of lithium present in seawater this does not translate to reserves reserves are a geologic commodity that can be economically extracted they got that much right at the start of their article currently all commercial lithium is sourced from ores and brines on land which contains a total lithium reserve of million tons according to the latest survey conducted this year they outline a possible process of extracting lithium from sea water but it is not even remotely at a point that this technology could be used at an economic scale that it would act as a competitor to ore reserves

175,i dont think youre really aware of how cbtc actually works or how efficient trains are also its a lot better to just run as many as possible than to do some weird tech bro efficiency bullshit with it like rail examining the number of people waiting why having people state where theyre going this is horrible ux also why also train tickets turnstyles dynamically allocating trains to provide additional transit as necessary this already happens automatically slowing down certain trains by a couple minutes in order to alleviate congestion in stations what what congestion if theres congestion youd want more trains to move people this screws over people already on the train this makes them unreliable it is better for humans if there are consistent schedules without unexpected delays or speed ups like thats part of what makes taking the bus so horrible you dont know when its going to show up it gets stuck in traffic sometimes they skip your stop because the bus is full or the driver wants to and why would you need regenerative braking in trains do you know how trains work they speed up to the safest maximum speed then cut the power to slow down barely using brakes to come to a complete stop at the station if you ride a subway in a dense area like manhattan youll feel them pedal to the metal about halfway from station to station then they cut the power skilled operators can glide in in fact using the brakes on trains sucks horribly it fucks up your balance can make stuff knock over etc theres literally a japanese metro sim all about getting it as perfect as possible
176,actual tech that works on kia vehicles i see brake pads and rotors still at mm after miles on hybrids regenerative braking is not only a thing but mostly used in every hybrid or ev just because you dont understand it doesnt mean it isnt a thing idiot
177,lithium battery recycling is basically a brand new industry i think trying to make guesses on where its headed is pure conjecture based on zero reality or evidence whatsoever billions of dollars are being invested into it on top of that battery tech in general is moving outside of lithium alone
178,as a general rule in any industry planning you should never assume technological and major infrastructure advances without evidence of those trends already being established to some degree there are no trends yet to suggest rapid expansion and lithium recycling remains very expensive and specialized its conjecture to claim that there would be a massive expansion of lithium recycling and it is also conjecture to claim that battery tech on evs and other electronics will move away from mostly lithium and as i have said now times even if lithium were recycled on all lithium batteries in the future this would only help maintain lithium use as it grows it would not offset lithium purchases from growing demand which is what the article i cited discusses its not including depleting batteries being replaced over time its discussing raw growth of demand from almost a point of zero even at recycling success it is irrelevant to the point that we dont have enough lithium to begin with if battery tech moves to some more available resource thats another matter in itself that is also conjecture projecting with what technology we have now is the most realistic way to plan around commodity usage we can use cobalt as an analog supply challenges fuel efforts recycle ev and smartphone batteries uk consultant creation inn estimates that by of cobalt will be recycled the bulk of that in china managing director hans eric melin suggests that this wont have a huge impact on the supply chain or pricing because of the expected growth in demand for cobalt such is the demand for cobalt he adds that recyclers and battery makers are converging on limited supplies shenzhen based gem chinas largest recycler which provides cobalt to battery makers has been trying to secure a deal to take a third of mining firm glencores output for a three year period because it cant supply enough cobalt from recycling meanwhile one of its customers battery maker catl has taken a majority stake in another recycler guangdong brunp recycling technology

185,youre always safer if you happen to collide with a small car rather than a large one anyway yes that was a bit of a twisting of your words i know thats not what you meant its the truth though those who think that driving big is driving safe or that lightweight fuel efficient vehicles are inherently more dangerous than their heavyweight counterparts need to think again a researcher with lawrence berkeley national lab berkeley lab has teamed with a researcher from the university of michigan in a unique risk analysis study which shows that contrary to conventional wisdom vehicle quality is a much more important safety factor than weight for the drivers of vehicles involved in a crash most cars are safer than the average sports utility vehicle suv while pickup trucks are much less safe than all other types minivans and import luxury cars have the safest records states the report an analysis of traffic deaths by vehicle type and model which was prepared by tom wenzel an energy analyst with berkeley labs environmental energy technologies division and marc ross a professor in michigans applied physics department a shortcoming of many safety analyses has been that only risks to drivers of a given kind of vehicle are evaluated while the risks imposed on others are ignored says wenzel we focused on the risk not only to occupants of the vehicle model in question in all types of crashes but also on the risk to the drivers of other vehicles involved in crashes with the model in question wenzel and ross determined that suvs are no safer for their drivers than the average midsize or large car and not much safer than many of the most popular compact and subcompact car models drivers of pickup trucks are at even greater risk than drivers of suvs when the combined risk is considered suvs and pickup trucks are revealed to be significantly more dangerous than just about any car all the evidence in our study shows that vehicles can be and in fact are being made lighter and more fuel efficient without sacrificing safety says wenzel the argument that lowering the weight of cars to achieve high fuel economy has resulted in excess deaths is unfounded is bigger safer it aint necessarily so articlesarchiveeetd suv safetyhtml berkeley lab in other words when considering size alone it is the size of the vehicle you collide with that is most important not the size of your own by driving a big vehicle all you are really doing is increasing the amount of kinetic energy involved in collisions which is bad however this fact doesnt tend to sell cars and make profit as well as the bigger cars are safer mantra of the advertising industry

217,technology is still a long way off i was talking to a friend about this and he says its a race between two technologies cameras and lidar cameras are outside in which means they scan the environment and act accordingly the benefit of this is that camera technology has had a head start so design wise theyre low profile but theyre extremely inaccurate lidar is inside out which means they send out light signals and scan the environment based on how the light is reflected the benefit of this is that theyre extremely accurate but design wise theres a big ol spinning doo hickey on top of the car its going to come down to whether cameras can become more accurate or if lidar can minimize its visual footprint at least this is what my friends in tech predict im a layman so i take everything they say as gospel

219,a bed in a car what a novel idea you could probably even increase the efficiency by linking multiple cars together if enough people started taking the same routes at the same times you could even dedicate a set path for those linked cars to follow at that point you could probably even change the tires out for wheels and use some sort of dedicated track what a crazy bit of future tech
220,longhaul never shorthaul maybe keep in mind that airplane ticket prices would also drop as tech progress and more efficient engines and planes are manufactured making also convenient its a broad statement it only affects flights from a small range self driving cars are in niche market available in certain countries where gps is available and road maps are accurate if youre destination is covered by roads
221,if i wanted to invest in this technology in a publicly traded company which companies are attractive

227,no its not airlines are about getting to your destination fast if this were an interupting technology people would pay for trains with sleeping cabins over a plane
228,no its not airlines are about getting to your destination fast if this were an interupting technology people would pay for trains with sleeping cabins over a plane
229,by the time tech is good enough to do that planes will be quicker and go further i just dont think people would rather travel for a whole day and be able to lie down over be there in a couple of hours
230,not really because then night time traffic would increase and it would take way longer to get to your destination than flying people seem to think that theyll be the only one using this technology like elons stupid tunnels that only fit one car at a time which means that it would take forever for cars to travel the same distance when compared to cars on a street level road

234,how do you invest in driverless technologies who is the leader of it where can we put money behind it
235,driverless vehicles affect on driving jobs will be one of the most disruptive examples of technology in the not so distant future bus drivers truck drivers taxiride share just to name a few that come to mind

237,oh no self driving cars will hurt the airlines what are they supposed to do innovate their industry to keep up with new advances in technology
238,oh no self driving cars will hurt the airlines what are they supposed to do innovate their industry to keep up with new advances in technology
239,especially with the efficiency that could be gained by automating traffic flow and speed you could redesign the vehicle to have fewer compromises on speed drivability etc couple lanes of a highway or dedicated roads that only driverless cars can operate on there are a lot of options to incrementally introduce this tech as it comes closerto being a reality average people could rent a driverless car or spot on a bustrain wealthy people would have their own ultra luxury models be able to use faster calibrated lanes etc
240,ya im hopeful someday well separate our identity from our occupations and people can live to work instead of the other way around almost all new technology destroys old industries and its not always pretty

242,as a very old millennial this is the ideal world for me work remotely live remotely total freedom in where you want to be its the new american dream instead of working yourself to death weeks out of the year to have measly weeks of vacation why not make every weekend your vacation spot and next week youll work somewhere else and have a weekend there the tech is already almost there we as a society just have to say yes to it electric self driving rvs would be an amazing way to live that lifestyle
243,while you have less privacy you also have much more space and comfort on a train plus is a technology already existing then you take the autonomous carpooling to do the last mile from the station to home

245,its such a shame battery tech is relatively speaking so shit compared to all the other leaps and bounds were making i just want an electric motorcycle that doesnt cost more than my car and gets more than miles range without an additional expansion pack
246,i tend to think that when the tech gets good enough most cars will begin to look more and more like rvs more like a cube with a desk a refrigerator something to heat your food at least a urinal large format screens instead of small ones panoramic windows and roofs when i see dudes in a tesla reclined and asleep more and more often online and in real life i cant help but think theyd be so much more comfortable on an actual bed or at least a pull out couch
247,really a lot of it has to do with energy and the ways the universe does not like energy to be stored the problem always boils down to some simple principle and in this case its that the universe tends to not like dense packets of energy ie a battery i havent been keeping up with the latest tech but i know that lithium ion was the best for so long because everything else we tried could store a lot more energy but for not nearly as long its really a giant middle finger to physicists in that way
248,right now electric rvs for travel arent very feasible because of their size necessary range and current technology limitations but maybe in the future people already use solar panels to help overcome having to run a generator in their rv though

254,there is a moped company in india i believe that has electric mopeds and their batteries can be swapped out for fresh ones based on a subscription or a paid per swap use and they are a cartridge battery that slides in under the seat if i remember correctly tesla originally had an idea for something automated like this where you would pull up and it would swap out the battery under your car and you could just be on your way in less time than it took to fill up a car way too many complications when talking about a car system but very possible when talking about bikes although maybe not dirt bikes due to contamination maybe as time goes on this will be the way forward with battery technology to get over the range or recharge anxiety

265,self driving cars as a concept are great but not everyone is capable of the engineering required to make a safe autonomous vehicle i would trust google x or tesla to make a good self driving car because they have the experience and talent in systems electrical software and mechanical engineering to pull of such a complicated project but uber is not on their level uber is not really a technology company theyre an appservice provider the uber app could be made by any year old app developer its not complicated so why is uber in the same conversation as companies that have been at the cutting edge of ai for the past decades

273,there is zero guarantee a true self driving car will ever exist or be more than a glorified taxi for pre selected routes on perfectly mapped and pristine roads and certainly they will never replace more than a tiny tiny fraction of vehicles in the near to distant future were ages away if ever from the fantasy of fully automated vehicles the day they build a car that can go from random destination a to random destination b without any help from the driver is not any time soon if ever what well have is lane assist type technology becoming more standard but thats about it

279,all the accident avoidance features of self driving cars could be put into cars without the self driving feature this stuff should be tested with many millions of miles before self driving is enabled but it wont because wed rather kill a few people to get that cool tech out sooner
280,i think its more about not being in control thats what bothers me about flying also something about placing your life in the hands of others or ai just doesnt sit well with meeven if it is technically safer
281,feel like noone else is concerned what a malicious tech savvy person will be able to do to fuck with automated vehicles
282,its good to see most companies sending a united message that they believe in the technology rather than assigning blame and distancing themselves from the accident

284,im anticipating self driving cars is the next nuclear energy technically better than every solution but demonized as fuck because of political and moral reasons
285,its a risk that has to be taken if the tech is to be advanced a lot of people are going to die trying to make it to space in the future
286,the example i like to give is to ask would seem acceptable if i could wave a magic wand and make all the cars self driving tomorrow but with the knowledge that on average people every day will die due to failures in the technology person in every state every day dies that sounds like an absurdly high number of deaths until you find out that human drivers kill twice that many every day its almost inconceivable to me that self driving cars could possibly not be significantly safer for everyone once the technology has been properly developed

288,i know that autonomous cars are safer i have been following the studies and growth of the technology for years just as a curious hobbyist not an expert but there will come a time when a person or group of people is killed by an autonomous car and it will be all over the news and there will be a lot of people in the camp of i just dont trust them robot cars the data will not matter because even though autonomous cars are safer than human drivers there will be people who will wish for the system of human choice over the cold unfeeling determinism of machines

290,and here we are with the trolley problem if we actively implement a large scale usage of self driving cars we are technically condemning those who will die because of them even if we save many more than we kill it is a very complicated ethics problem
291,the difference is that with time machine error will continue to drop as more and more advances are made to the technology used whereas people seem to only cause more and more accidents as time goes by acceptance of self drivings cars is the first step to automating transportation for everyone machines will cause less and less accidents because of uncontrollable variableshumans affecting the environment in which they operate

298,so killing people with cars accidentally is immoral but killing them with logic and science is totally awesome because progress i gotta say in the industry im in if i killed anyone including an animal which other people in my industry have designed and built things that killed children i would be shut down and rightfully so i dont think its a good sales pitch for me to go to a customer and say that the use of my new product i designed will certainly lead to a couple of deaths but it will be less deaths than the product i built last time because with this technology you have no control over it we are definitely getting dumber

310,you mean save money on the lidar tech they stole from google
311,toyota is behind in the automation game at this point theyre investing in automation to stay relevant not because theyve got this new fangled tech they want you to buy
312,planes are not fully automated and have never been they fly in an open space for a bit and land in a relatively busy airport but with a room full of incredibly organised people that make sure things go right so the flying is really all that is automated the heavy stuff is still for actual humans ignoring the technicalities altitude engine management etc planes have about the ability of a tesla to be able to take a car put it on the road and let it drive its self there are so many more obstacles in the way not to mention there are active airplanes in the world compared to about a billion vehicles quite the difference also as of right now self driving cars are not as good at driving as experienced drivers they are actually worse than a drunk driver at this point if you want sources do a google search

319,ambulances and fire trucks kill people as do the police themselves highways save lives but speed kills conversely it is argued using the atomic bomb saved lives the whole trolley argument against sd cars to me is synthetic the situations have nothing to do with the technology like the whataboutism being used in populist politics any change in behavior faces this and in driving you can not imo show me any situation where the sd case is worse than a human driver the objective is to detect and respond to as much simultaneous information situations as possible

321,i believe siemens and other companies are working on self flying cars quadrocopters ive heard engineers say its a less challenging technical feat than trying to make self driving cars there are no pedestrians the infrastructure can be designed from the ground up etc in my opinion its just that any small fender bender could be catastrophic
322,they certainly do and that often involves large and complicated lawsuits and recalls as im sure you are aware but extending it to ai technology that makes driving decisions is a big expansion of liability

324,san francisco is where tech magic happens best city ever
325,ok that sentence is a bit confusing all im saying is self driving cars arent going to be a thing for the average person not for a long long time if ever they will be gimmicks for rich people to drive around pre programmed ultra safe routes no one is going to have a self driving car to take them to work and the store or a cross country trip the reality of our crumbling road infrastructure legislation and realities of ai and sensor capabilities will prove me correct were not actually making any advances along those fronts in any meaningful capacity machine learning isnt magic like everyone on rfuturology seems to think it is eventually the companies themselves will stop throwing money at this stuff for little return plenty of technology has gone in that direction

327,actually because of the technology built into these cars they could be controlled by a central traffic authority everything about them could be controlled including speed when and were they could be driven and how often there could even be a licensing system set up for how often people want to use the cars want access thats a really high license fee limited use like back and forth to work would cost less however spontaneous shopping trips would be limited all of this could be justified in terms of keep traffic flowing at a steady but safe pace fuel economy environmental concerns safety and other social concerns the era of jumping in your car and going where you want and when you want will be over i dont say i like it but the temptation to eliminate all the bad things associated with cars controlled by individuals will too great for those in charge to resist my advice keep a big block chevelle hidden in your garage

335,dont worry theyll find some way to push that liability on to consumers as they always have worst case scenario they just subcontract it to a corporation designed specifically to deal with such issues thats a legal stone you cant squeeze blood from you think musks lawyer army didnt figure this out long before they installed their first ai driving tech
336,i understand and am responding to what you wrote a human must take active responsibility because of a dangerous situation once every which means with no human interaction there would beon the extremely limited dataset of the technology of today which is also getting better with every mile drivenone accident however ive years of drivingwith federal government trainingand i have to take constant action to avoid accidents in situations created by other drivers and other drivers are not getting better they are getting more numerous therefore if a human only has to take correction once every miles that means there is less opportunity for humans to screw it up when called upon to do the right thing now imagine a world in the near future where there is a greater percentage of automated cars which reduces the ratio of better drivers there will be less accidents and less incidents for with the cars will have to respond ergo a safer experience your figures support that conclusion

348,high end you think that will apply reliably to cheap daily drivers really you think that shit wont get hacked and shut down the entire in socal just to entertain some asshole and his friends you think people wont tinker their shit like idiots to make it drive faster and cause accidents as a result you think that when glitches do happen and they sure as hell will theyll only affect one car what happens when someone fucks up the programming on the ford focus and they roll out prone to total failure under some one in a millionthus rather common but not always easy to find ahead of time circumstance what happens when they fuck up some hardware as happens pretty much every year to at least one major manufacturer and the programming doesnt know how to deal with the trouble that the hardware problem causes like an uneven front brake performance under extreme cold while going downhill causing sudden swerve to one side hell what happens when we realize that always put driver safety first or never swerve ends up not actually being a good rule and people die because of stupid programming decisions besides which this tech will not become as common as quickly as elon musk and others think until it can cycle into the secondary market in very large numbers for over a decade while still being safely usable it wont replace the year old hondas and toyotas and old ford pickups on the road so it will be all automated vehicles so road conditions will be less chaotic is blatant nonsense maybe in years maybe if wealth inequality lessens as well in that time
349,this whole damned debate is moot some philosophers pondered whether an ai should analyze potential victims and survival rates like i robot and theorized a debate over what the criteria should be self driving cars will react to avoid an accident by driving within appropriate reacting distance you should not be driving faster than you can see to stop we as humans think were awesome and drive as we see fit tailgating like a mofo at mph so we philosophically believe that any sort of technology needs to trade off efficiency with usability leading to the debate about who needs to die first but really as per drivers ed and actual research we should be driving to allow enough time and distance to stop if the car in front of us stops self driving cars can actually adhere to this and thereby avoid unavoidable accidents by following the correct guidelines

351,not spot on actually the statement if it hits someone a person would have hit that someone is patently incorrect particularly in these the early days of the technology anyone who has built out anything of the type be it facial recognition or text to speech will admonish you for the pitfalls of that thinking yes it will be safer in aggregate and yes it will often prevent accidents that a human being would not have but it is absolutely going to kill a bunch of people where if you had a reasonable driver behind the wheel there is no way they make that mistake

353,vulnerable people are supposed to have carers if the crosser had more sense and the driver did their job this would not have happened technological advancement is already moving at a snails pace without stopping all testing because of two blatant individual failings i hope her family sues the shit out of the negligent blob

357,because for a lot of especially younger employees it undermines their ability to maintain a healthy work life balance its recently come to light as something employees in the tech industry should be very keen to manage to prevent burnoutmental health issueslost productivitygenerally feeling like shit
358,in that specific case sure but if you can come up with some simple rule for when to land and when not to then yes a computer could do it trivially however thats clearly not the case hence why its good to have a well trained human there ml techniques are very powerful but only in very narrow specific contexts they are nowhere near being ready for something like decide whether or not we should try to land in these conditions
359,makes me wonder if the driver was already sleepy enough to consider sleeping in his seat would it be safer for him to drive his car manually or was relying completely on current imperfect autopilot tech the safer course of action
360,maybe im looking at this all wrong but the fact he was able to to go that long in that kind of traffic is proof enough for me that this tech actually works
361,other makes for years have had camera based systems that look at the driver to detect whether they are paying attention or not since telsa is so gung ho about their camera tech why dont they have that kind of safeguard
362,the things that drives me nuts about all of these articles is that they blame tesla for what people are doing anyone using a defeat device for their ap hand detection is a scumbag and deserves a steep ticket anyone intentionally thinking they can grab a nap is a scumbag putting people in danger and deserves an arrest immediately assume that the person is doing whatever is happening intentionally there will probably be dozens of people that accidentally fall asleep while driving this week and crash hopefully solo but many will crash into other people there will probably be at least a handful of seizuresstrokesdiabetic shock whatevers this week that cause someone to crash those things are most likely not that persons fault gloss over the fact that not one of these instances being rabidly spread all over the internet ends with a collision much less injury people have so many reasons why they crash some of them may be happening in these videos but everyones knee jerk reaction is fuck that guy for intentionally sleeping he should die and tesla is to blame how about acknowledge that this technology might save you from death if you or one of your fellow motorists has a medical emergency while driving it safely got this guy down the road for allegedly minutes without incident id say thats pretty remarkable

364,we already have fully autoniomic electric driving its called trains no need to fucking destroy the earth by mining fucktons of lithium tesla is not saving the world we cant all drive a tesla because there is not enough resources on earth to switch we should improve the hydrogen fuel cell instead we need this tech to switch to solar and wind anyway
365,im not a futurist but im going to sound like one future caught up to reality the current tesla has full autopilot as in you could sleep in it the issue is that legally tesla cant deploy the technology until they get x number of hoursmiles showing their technology is or times better than a human driver it has fully redundant cpus in the new version not running current nvidia and musk has more or less said this is checkmate the level and precision to which he describes it makes me believe him ive seen him exaggerate claims of doing x before some date this isnt that they have of the driving data collected on the road its not perfect technology you arent either youre a shitty driver its better than you and were going to hit a point where we have to acknowledge that and its gonna be uncomfortable heres an interview he recently did with an mit ai researcher vdevvxkjvi

367,should have renamed this article attempted fearmongering about technology when said technology saved people on the highway from a inattentive driver fall asleep in a standard car and a crash is pretty much guaranteed fall asleep in a car with automated assistance and nobody got hurt

369,im not sure how i could use this tech without being distractedor just reallllly bored like i often dont use cruise control just to stay more engaged id rather have a fully self driving car or a fully manual drive car with safety overrides from stuff sure
370,it would probably even be a better idea for the environment if america completely rebuilt all their cities for proper public transportation instead of waiting until everyone can drive around sleeping in their individual little metal pods im not against the technology in itself but those who see this as some utopian solution are very far from realistic

372,its going to be great and so much saferwhen that one accident happened where the biker was run over people where acted like it was the technologies fault but the guy literally just drove onto the street from behind an obstacleits sad that it happened but a human driver couldnt have prevented that
373,tesla still maintains that you need to be paying attention while using lane assist autosteer so if you see something like this call the cops on that person they are making a dangerous decision relying on technology that is not full self driving yet they should get a ticket for the same violation anyone else falling asleep behind the wheel would get having autosteer on doesnt give them any credit

375,once these systems have been perfected id much rather have technology driving that never sleeps never gets distracted virtually never overlooks anything and can respond faster than a human ever could why do you think so many functions on airplanes and trains have been automated they make less mistakes

377,i feel like its the opposite expectations havent caught up with technology the person in the driver seat has to be awake why isnt the point of a self driving car supposed to be that its self driving logically theres not much of a problem with someone falling asleep its like people feel more comfortable when theres a human operator even though were far more prone to mistakes

383,this supposed autonomous vehicle technology is extremely dangerous we are no where near a truly autonomous vehicle but people continue to behave as if their car is truly autonomous xb cars with partial autonomous systems are far more dangerous than standard cars for the simple reason that the driver is expected to take over in situations where the car fails but the driver cannot be alert and fully cognizant of the traffic conditions if heshe is not driving the vehicle xb there are so many companies who want this technology and they have so influenced our governments that they are allowed to put these dangerous vehicles on our roads be afraid

385,look like the tech has caught up and why that dude snitch like that why not hit the horn or ap the window why they always get the law involved
386,and where human stupidity hasnt cought up to technological advancements and there limitations
387,and where human stupidity hasnt cought up to technological advancements and there limitations
388,funny part is its not like hes coming out of a hour drive cross country just some dumbass completely trusting technology probably just got on the road why drive let the car do it play on your phone or even read a book but atleast be awake

394,i would not put that much trust into technology yet especially since this technology is still in its baby stages
395,i would not put that much trust into technology yet especially since this technology is still in its baby stages
396,teslas are not fully autonomous vehicles trusting them completely with your life is foolish there is a reason that all documentation from tesla says you need to keep your hands on the wheels and stay alert however the public messaging from the company is that you dont need to do any of that computers make mistakes all the time i dont care if you trust your life in it my life driving next to you is on the line im all for a day in the future when its been proven and tested properly but this is new tech being iterated on very often a programmer puts a bug through that has an issue and who knows what will happen
397,technology as far exceeded my expectation of how creeped out and unsettled it makes me feel
398,technology as far exceeded my expectation of how creeped out and unsettled it makes me feel
399,period where technology hasnt caught up to expectations what a joke i watched the jetsons as a kid wheres my two hour work day and flying car that show came out in the s thats a long transitional period

401,or expectations havent caught up to the technology
402,or expectations havent caught up to the technology
403,or expectations havent caught up with the tech that car drives more safely than most drivers not saying this is okay but the narrative is pretty much shit
404,yeh hes going to crash lol p fact is it can autopilot you but it doesnt account for when idiots dont stop in time and its more difficult for it to navigate roundabouts or someone pulls up in front of you as ive learned from tesla drivers you need to be awake to get ready to switch to manual or hit the breaks when needed even when technology gets even better you cant take out the human equation completely you still need to stop and recharge your car at some point on longer journeys too

406,im sure truck drivers taxi drivers delivery and any other driver hates this technology it will essentially make their jobs obsolete and no longer needed imagine pizza cars without drivers they can have a smaller footprint since you dont need a person to operate it just a hot pizza over with wheels or amazon trucks that can literally drive

408,uhh right more like fucking musk and tesla are confusing idiots with misleading marketing and trying to push the technology out too fast tesla is only at level it shouldnt be allowed on the roads because of shit like this also they should be sued for misleading marketing

410,the authorities keep freaking out when people get caught doing this we keep getting fed a drum beat by the media that the technology isnt there yet these articles are actually telling us the technology is already there or else this wouldnt keep happening this certainly isnt the first time this was done by all of the people involved without any incidents the only people that havent accepted it are the authorities that keep freaking out about it

412,technology hasnt caught up with expectations umm the guy should have been expected to be in an accident and there was no accident if say that this was just the opposite technology surpassed expectations that said dont do this it is stupid and it is dangerous tesla should put software to detect these bypass devices eg constant pull on the wheel and permanently disable ap on those cars

417,did he crash if not i would consider it being a case of technology passing up expectations so did he crash or not if not why are people even talking about this when we have protests in hong kong and actual news
418,that should be illegal any emergency override features in that car are useless and redundant when the occupants show such a lack of responsibilty personally i believe we put too much trust in technology
419,that should be illegal any emergency override features in that car are useless and redundant when the occupants show such a lack of responsibilty personally i believe we put too much trust in technology
420,no matter how good the tech idiots will abuse it to the max often with fatal consequences
421,how is this surprising at all people are idiots self driving cars are the dumbest idea now theres lane avoidance adaptive cruise control self parking cars people are relying on too much tech and nobodies even learning how to drive properly
422,this kind of technology is going to make drunk driving and traffic enforcement obsolete
423,this kind of technology is going to make drunk driving and traffic enforcement obsolete
424,i find it amazing that people trust an emerging technology with their lives so completely xb if i went parachuting which i would never do because fuck that i would want at least back up parachutes and i would still be unconvinced that all of them werent going to fail
425,i find it amazing that people trust an emerging technology with their lives so completely xb if i went parachuting which i would never do because fuck that i would want at least back up parachutes and i would still be unconvinced that all of them werent going to fail
426,this is why i think these kind of cars will be outlawed after the involuntary manslaughter cases become premeditated murder cases humans simply do not have the judgment required to deserve this kind of tech
427,you really do want to race us to the bottom huh catching zs on your commute might sound cute until it becomes the norm its great to have safety features which mitigate the risk of falling asleep or micro dozing of course but this has some greater implications to consider for the technocrats designing this
428,yep thats the point but as of now neither the tech nor the law are ready for that
429,if the driver was sleepy drunk enough to consider sleeping passing out in his seat would it be safer for him to drive his car manually or was relying completely on current imperfect autopilot tech the safer course of action same logic but i doubt anyone would think this way
430,agree i own a non ap tesla and it drives me nuts when i see posts like this this technology isnt there yet and when this guy or someone just as stupid as he is kills himself or innocent people tesla is going to be the one to take the fall for it this is why we cant have nice things fuck this guy
431,agree i own a non ap tesla and it drives me nuts when i see posts like this this technology isnt there yet and when this guy or someone just as stupid as he is kills himself or innocent people tesla is going to be the one to take the fall for it this is why we cant have nice things fuck this guy
432,as an owner and an active participant in the tesla community i dont hear anyone talking about this in any way other than a guy being extremely reckless behavior like this whether its sleeping or trolling is incredibly frustrating and people who own and love the cars are regularly educating those less familiar with the current limitations of the tech this is the future and we can all talk about it that way because in the future it will be safe to do this after the technology is ready and federal regulations have been passed it is not safe to do this today not even close and these people are putting lives in danger by not understanding or willingly ignoring the limitations of the technology what i think probably happened here is this guy got sick of the tesla nag that requires your hands to be on the wheel and defeated it by tying some sort of weight to the wheel incredibly reckless move and then accidentally fell asleep incredibly reckless move despite this he hasnt crashed that is the one positive to take away from it the technology prevented a driver who fell asleep from injuring himself or others despite his reckless behavior its ok to applaud that while continuing to iterate to make this sort of thing harder to do recklessly

434,the news report said the tesla auto pilot turns off if the wheel isnt engaged is that true the tesla will just run into something despite the technology it has to not run into something

436,well to be fair the title does say the technology hasnt caught up to the expectation

441,you know whats really cool all the lost truck driving jobs and people forced into poverty by capital and technology
442,well the full tesla autopilot is still a far better driver than any human so it doesnt bother me if thats what the car was using the title is wrong the expectations are far behind the technology it will take time but eventually the greater public will realize the advantages that already exist xb it boils down to this the more people using autopilot the less people die what else matters xb edit im open to having my mind changed always looking for reputable statistics that disprove what i already know until then seems like youre agreeing with the person above purely because its cool to hate on something people are excited about elon musk fanboys like musk or not and i dont love him hes doing some incredible things

444,people continuing to overestimate technology they dont understand is going to lead to injuries and death it annoys me when people gasp about how their car is like magic this technology is far from perfect pay the fuck attention before you kill somebody idiot

446,they absolutely should mercedes have had tech for a few years now that monitors the drivers eyes and if they start to nod off they sound an audible alert i have no idea why tesla dont do the same maybe patented
447,because this way they get a reputation for having self driving cars ahead of everyone else if theres a few fatalities and opinion shifts they will absolutely switch to camera tech as long as it keeps working in their favour why bother
448,read the article it was not meant to be fully automatic just some and you have to stay awake for it xb i know the fwy and i know that it does curve somewhere but the fact that the tesla didnt implement something with current existing technology surprises me

450,ok and then other jobs will open up that they can take just cause one industrygroup of industries is disrupted by new technology that doesnt mean those people arent needed elsewhere those people who are now obsolete can and should adapt and find other things to do yeah easier said than done but its true keeping the status quo and not innovating out of fear of being replaced does more harm than good

452,riskier riskier are you crazy even in these early days of automated driving theyve already proven to be much safer than human drivers do you know how many accidents humans cause compared to automated cars per capita maybe do some homework friend and that ratio will only spread more as tech improves
453,not gonna happen buddy every last trucking and taxi company is eyeing self driving tech with undisguised greed they will clear the road
454,how can you sleep comfortably in a car all night it would be cool if they put the technology in a bus or rv
455,how can you sleep comfortably in a car all night it would be cool if they put the technology in a bus or rv
456,i cant even possibly imagine it oh wait i can its called a plane or a train or a bus weve had that technology for a century why are you so excited about the possibility that you could do it in a private car instead
457,i cant even possibly imagine it oh wait i can its called a plane or a train or a bus weve had that technology for a century why are you so excited about the possibility that you could do it in a private car instead
458,no no no no no this kind of shit should never be the norm ever you dont let a pilot fall asleep with nobody else at the helm even though the plane can fly itself and said plane is thousands of feet above and away from any telephone poles or people or other such things it could strike because if things go wrong the computer cant be trusted to save the aircraft see the max as stinging and recent proof for how these systems can go wrong a car is in a far far more treacherous environment than an aircraft so its driver should always be alert of their surroundings regardless of what autopilot or self driving capabilities it has you know what forms of local transport remove all responsibility from you allowing you to sleep or play games or whatever buses trains or planes if you have to go farther take those instead if they arent available make your city invest in them theyre better for the environment than personal transport too talk like this makes me resentful of self driving car advocates because it basically says i want all the benefits of mass transportation combined with all the excess and waste of personal transport its a stupid stupid reason to want self driving technology

460,dang good find this looks much worse than op being a tesla shill theres nothing wrong with being passionate about the technology you just need to remember that itll take decades before we get true autonomy maybe more

462,no and i hate to just go straight flamewar on someone but shut up and stop condoning people hacking their cars to sleep on public highways saying ridiculous things like robots can drive better than people is a childlike fantasy tale and no current tech or law should have anyone anyone tesla or not running around doing hack overrides of their cars safety features so that they can sleep while they drive this is so infuriatingly irresponsible and only undertaken by the biggest selfish turds who are trying to use a shared dangerous space to create viral youtube content to go viral on reddit there are hours of the day that you can sleep that dont involve going to bed for a useless minute nap while stunt driving on the sole road tens of thousands of people are using to get on with their lives who are not distracted and have to deal with someone next to them who is literally asleep just like we dont let jeff gordon guzzle jack daniels while going mph even though he won a bunch of nascar races the tech will be cool thats it right now its not and thinking anyone anywhere has the right to pull these behaviors is gross selfishness
463,im putting the blame on the driver and everyone who endorses the behavior and reshares stunt driving especially a flagrantly pro tesla mod who thinks promoting these videos is cool do you not see the cult like tesla owners and other non owners who are delusional tech zealots calling this perfectly safe the person equating them to rosa parks for their breaking of the law obviously youre a big rah rah tesla dude and im obviously ranting against them here but this has zero to do with whether a tesla is a cool car whether assisted driving makes life easier etc it has to do with someone so disgustingly and willfully pranking trolling promoting or whatever web term you want to use to describe an asshole on a highway pulling a stunt and watching a bunch of people promote the behavior online there are other ways to use assisted driving features that dont involve trying to become viral on the internet through safety feature hacking and doing eyes closed driving youd obviously feel different if it was a different brand jesus christ youre pathetic stop trying to gaslight me with this bullshit and deflecting youre agreeing its idiotic but then saying my opinion is wrong andor would differ if it was a different brand well which is it genius am i right or wrong youre proving my point fantastically by going after me and not the driver or person sharing this unsafe crap if i saw someone promoting this same behavior in a ferrari or a geo id say the same damn thing but im not and you can either choose to join the rank of people who think this is cool or join those of us in reality who dont think some rich jerk should make a commuter road their playground to flex and create viral shock content
464,to be considered safer than a human driver it has to kill at most person per million miles the technology has not proved itself to be safer than a human driver despite what tesla pr says

466,pay the fuck attention before you kill somebody idiot human drivers have already been cavalier about this for decades before any kind of smart tech was in cars at all the new technology is filling a horrible existing gap more than its creating one
467,pay the fuck attention before you kill somebody idiot human drivers have already been cavalier about this for decades before any kind of smart tech was in cars at all the new technology is filling a horrible existing gap more than its creating one
468,those people who are now obsolete can and should adapt and find other things to do they should but many dont see coal miners i forget the exact number but of course we all know that trucking is a huge industry to think that the millions of drivers out there will just shrug and go learn another trade when ai takes off is naive dont get me wrong im all for self driving tech im just saying that once it begins to disrupt jobs people arent going to go quietly which can lead to other problems
469,pretty clear that its talking about expectations of the technology as opposed to the driver
470,pretty clear that its talking about expectations of the technology as opposed to the driver
471,i disagree the phrase doesnt make sense in that case since that expectation should be going down as technology progresses not down
472,i disagree the phrase doesnt make sense in that case since that expectation should be going down as technology progresses not down
473,k maybe not the dumbest but a horrible idea the only reason we dont have flying cars everywhere by now is because people are idiots cant see self driving cars turning out much better imo people rely way too much on tech that might not always be there for example theres apparently a need for cars now to basicly tell you hey youre about to leave your child in the back of this hot car to die i guess its a good thing but pathetic that its necessary
474,i agree with everything you said and look forward to a future of self driving cars mobility would increase drastically and the economic benefits are enticing add cross country bullet trainsit would be so nice however the one hiccup i see is in the transportation of children they need car seats as a child passeneger safety technician instructor of car seats are either wrong seat for the child used improperly installed wrong or any combination thereof add having to put them in and take then out for every tripi only see that worsening parents sacrificing safety for convenience will also increase happens already about age unfortunately a car with car seats pre installed may sound like the solution but each child needs their own configuration to fit the seat properly and in the right direction all seats would need to be the same so parents know how to use it properly each brand has their own gimmick or special thing which is a pain in the ass and each family has a different number of kids with varying ages this is the majority of our population and then theres special needs children with even more specialized seats cars are designed around the safety of adults car seats adapt children to the safety features because their little bodies cannot withstand crash forces nor fit a standard seat belt without one until cars are designed for infants and children car seats will always be needed and our hopes of a fully autonomous vehicle world with be burdened with this issue edit fixed some words
475,oh and other benefits you never have to defrost your car you never have to worry about maintenance you never have to get an mot you never have to change a tire you never have to gas it up you never have to park it you never have to wait for it to warm up in the mornings err just fyi this is not necessarily a good thing the way people handle maintenance right now is inconvenient sure but at least gives the consumer more power in this equation moving to a subscription based service you are going to be paying for maintenance for tire changes for gas and other wear and tear items on a vehicle but thats just going to be part of your fee the kicker here is that you no longer get to decide how they decide to perform their maintenance and with what parts companies down the value chain will start to charge premiums for their parts and the subscription service companiesfleet owners will pass that cost onto the end user tacked on with their own hidden fees to create extra revenue sure capitalism might dictate that competition will weed out any extraneous price gouging from the companies but in practice we as a society move closer and closer to consolidation and tech monopolies as time progresses you can argue that the cost savings from other benefits will cancel this out initially and that may be true but down the line this is going to be another part of the equation that is out of the consumers hands you have noted some tangible benefits but i dont have faith that the end user will win in this specific regard
476,some questions where will all the cars go when theyre not in use as you probably know car use is a bell curve with highest utilization rates around morning am ishand evening pm ish so when the united states needs million cars on the road at am well still have rush hour traffic but where will those cars all go during off peak times if there are no longer parking lots people still need garages maybe well have smaller ones but you need a place for bikes scooters maybe storage or an easy way to bring groceries into the house maybe this will transform somehow but im guessing people will still like garages in the future and houses without any garage will still be less desirable with more cars on the road roads will become more congested i know self driving will likely allow more throughput and hence more cars on the road at a time but with cars going all over a city like taxis or buses in nyc i think this would clog up the streets making the idea of living closer in still desirable there could be close to double the cars on the road as for every mile a car drives with a passenger it needs to travel back from the commercial districts to the residential districts empty streaming a car wont be that much cheaper than a taxi is today at least in big cities taxi drivers for example are often immigrants and actually make about minimum wage so maybe half of the cost of the fare goes to the driver the other half goes to maintenance gas credit card processing insurance depreciation or rental of the vehicle etc to replace a minimum wage driver can take expensive tech obviously self driving will be cheaper but not dramatically cheaper maybe of the price of a taxi would be my guess it will certainly not be the cost of owning a car thats for sure poorer people will continue to prefer public transport such as busses and subways this doesnt displace that the streaming service you describe will be a premium service to start with as for people that are just wealthy enough to buy a car owning a car can be as cheap as k per year plus all the other additional costs like gas and maintenance being the primary two that dont really decrease per mile driven and could increase slightly also without parking lots vehicles need to use more gas and will have more wear and tear to get back to its base or docking station so a new kia that leases for per month today would cost more if self driving tech were added in addition to self driving tech the vehicle would need to have better communication tech and there would need to be a backbone of maintenance guys to change tires or fix various issues that can happen and a used kia would cost even less i cant do the exact math on this because it is too complicated but overall im not saying it will be a little cheaper in some situations but it wont necessarily be that much cheaper
477,cars with tvs for children and reclining rear seats are technically already designed for entertainment and comfort but not for the driver
478,unfortunately solar panels on roofs are not physically possible with the way current roads are designed the surface area on top of a car isnt nearly big enough to capture enough sunlight to generate sufficient power to move a car cars of the future would have to be super light weight with very large roofs unless roads are completely redesigned across the world im afraid this technology wont happen within our lifetimes

480,i would work all day friday if were living in a society with the level of tech youre describing a friday work day would be a thing of the past it should be now
481,look forward to when self driving cars are the norm so accidents drop to virtually zero so cars are designed with comfort and entertainment in mind im worried that wont happen in our life times too many people are so invested in driving the cars themselves while humans are still on the road we are still going to need humans behind the wheel of self driving cars because only a human can understand how fucking stupid a human can be you know how old people are with tech someone is going to smash their car because it took a different route to the one they are used to some boomer is going to refuse to update their car and then blame the tech when they get hit with a zero day that has been known about for years we still havent managed to ween most people of wiping chemicals on thinly sliced tree as a means of communication
482,without any malice youre factually incorrect there was some controversy because tesla did falsely claim they reduced crashes by but even within the articles pointing out that that was an exaggeration its explained that it was still safer than human drivers and tesla has improved the tech since im not claiming a corporation is suddenly perfect and blowing elon musk but human drivers are just so terrible and technology doesnt get tired blink drink text or just generally get distracted or do one of the other billion things humans do while driving

484,yeah i think ive said else ware that like the internet rural america and rural anywhere is going to take longer and the tech needs to advance more before theyre adopted into the fold in the mean time theyll have access to cheap parts and cars presumably as people in cities abandon them as for firewoodcattle feed wow i mean isnt that basically a work vehicle at that point i wouldnt class that as a part of this train of thought at all if youre using the vehicle for a job then a subscription service definitely isnt for you in fact id even scale back the whole concept to only be applying to urban living or commuting between urban centers and strictly for commutingrecreation i wouldnt have an answer for work vehicles or rural living other than eventually itll trickle down but that doesnt sit right id guess for work vehicles which are specialized and used but also need to visit rural communities youd have to have a normal car which is also an auto but it would probably be illegal to use the manual drive in a city for traffic management purposes so it would automatically go into auto mode x miles from city and would allow manual override for rural areas so you can access off road areas
485,there are so many options to solve this problem both in the interim whilst existing manual cars still exist and once theyre all auto and its illegal to drive manually so firstly why would they clog the streets youd have less cars per person so existing parking spaces would free up or could simply be used to store the car until a job becomes available another option is orbiting the busiest cityarea link this in with internet communication and a company can live track where the traffic is and orbit in different areas or if one car pulls out of a parking spot another can take its place immediately in the longer term computers and data mining can begin to predict how many cars are required in certain areas in certain times and simply drive away into the country side or into custom built banks to recharge and be cleaned during down hours like and this sort of thing happens in the uk with the power grid when its half time at the world cup we have to spin up more generators because everyone puts the kettle on at the same time and causes a huge surge im sure therell be aches and pains as with any new system but ultimately theyre all solvable with digital technology and physical infrastructure underground parking lots for empty autos or just out of town parking structures specialist highways for empty autos

489,exactly what i thought we have that technology already and it works perfectly fine for mass transport if wed individualize it to single person transportation thatd be a step back in my honest opinion living in germany i never had the need for a car never owned one in my whole life but that is due to us having acceptable public transport infrastructure

491,its nice to see that with new technologies we see new kinds of stupids
492,the op makes a new spacex or tesla post ever days that gets k upvotes that i see when i go to the reddit homepage simply because i guess i enjoy reading tech articles this specific time theyre talking about some dude doing some illegal dangerous garbage and frames it in terms of it becoming the norm and going through a transition period regarding expectations and no mention of anything bad happening so yeah dont gaslight me with this prove they are endorsing this nonsense of course they are
493,if we are using official timezones then its technically not possible
494,didnt vladimir lenin say industrialization was going to lead to a post labor society and socialismcommunism was the only way forward that didnt involve mass poverty and then soviet communism caused mass poverty while the west grew fat off the fruits of industrialization and experienced full employment for decades to come its easy to predict which jobs will be lost to automation however trying to predict what ones will be created is like someone in the s predicting that people will be employed in offices operating computers or developing computer networks in the future new technology has been removing jobs and creating others since the dawn of civilization technology replaces people in the short term but in the long term it is always merely a tool assist to humans to reach new heights i dont see that paradigm changing unless true artificial general intelligence becomes more than just theory tldr the idea that a post labor society is looming in the near future and communism is required to deal with it is a lie as old as communism itself

498,they posted an article that talks about this negatively and you think theyre endorsing it you dont enjoy reading tech articles you enjoy hating on tesla and tracking the users that like tesla and musk so you can follow them around and shit on them
499,thats irrelevant technical trivia its like saying both i and the entirety of ibm are literally capable of creating virtual intelligence even when ibm advertises artificial intelligence tesla is a popular name when it comes to propaganda aka advertising the future of self driving cars so if somebody is interested in that then thats their opinion
500,i knew a programmer who happened to heat his house with a wood stove in the winter and every year wed help him haul and split wood came in handy one winter when the gas line into town broke and we were able to crash at his place programmers know how every modern piece of technology is built by the lowest bidder and shipped out before its ready so theyd rather do it themselves lol

502,so yeah me spending part of my day yesterday in this sub having a thoughtful conversation about deep sea autonomous boats for data collection was part of an act and im just here to stalk a mod who posts k upvote stories everyday there is no benefit to anyone to share this dudes stupidity and it is both the driver and the ops goal to get people watching the stunt which should be ignored and shunned for its danger and me saying something about it and getting a modicum of support has pissed you the hell off because apparently you really like the video too i wouldnt know truthfully because all youve done it attack me but ill infer until i hear otherwise for the dozenth time this story is trash and sharing it at all is encouraging stunt drivers to get more attention for life risking behavior the tech is cool and has potential show it off on private property imagine a bulletproof glass company decided to stand at the edge of their property and fire at their glass toward a public street filled with cars would you be cool with sharing that video i mean the tech had been proven right
503,i feel like this article is looking at the scenario completely wrong we have a cause effect solution scenario where the effect is known to be a need for replacement organs and the solution is to use those donated by auto fatalities but what they fail to address is the real serious issue the cause a quick google search shows that the leading cause of acute liver failure in the us is an overuse of acetaminophen and next up is hepatitis that is the cause that is what needs to be addressed another quick google search shows that diabetes and high blood pressure are the leading causes of kidney failure this is the problem the solution is to use donor organs the root of the problem isnt that people need organs its that there is a health crisis where people have diseases that need to be treated continuing my rant we have auto fatalities which are the problem and autonomous cars which are a solution that will eradicate the problem the solution to one problem shouldnt automatically be assumed to be the cause of a greater problem i know that this isnt a perfect analogy but stick with me even though a single auto death can save people the number other people have sited in these comments that doesnt mean that is a solution to the organ shortage reminder this is not the problem disease is the problem causing the need for replacement organs this starts a whole needs of the many vs needs of the few argument which opens a whole pandoras box of problems in ethics i just feel like im taking crazy pills when an article gets this much attention and completely fails to address the true problem disease in a scenario where lives are being saved by an advance in technology please if you have a counter to my argument post it so that i can get a different frame of view

507,you could get rid of the organ shortage over night by letting people sell their organs i know some people find that distasteful but by banning it you are basically condemning the people who need transplants to a slow painful death plus as some have mentioned here it is just a stop gap until d printed organ technology is ready

511,i am very skeptical of self driving cars and the upcoming self driving car revolution one thing is parking how are you ever going to find a parking spot with a self driving car and imagine parking in the city with parking garages everywhere and parallel parking sometimes even and how are they going to adjust for snow and heavy rain storms i remember when the military believed that self driving submarines were the next big thing to come but they found out they still needed humans to adjust for different conditions and the same happened with airplanes we understand we still need pilots to make adjustments throughout different flights based on different mid air conditions so i am really skeptical about self driving cars will ever become something you see daily even i think its magical thinking via technology

521,not a bad problem to have i mean literally thats what donnation means i dont need it anymore compare that to the situation of charities that report because so many people scam online there are less and less people willing to donate online the general idea was we have unneccesary deaths people die one from a gunshot wound to the head the other one from a missing liver translant lets cut that short by taking the otherwise still useable gunshot victims liver and sowing it into the other patients body we can save one of them guaranteed the idea was never we have a right to those organ numbers we have a right to now demand those organs the idea was never we now get to complain because large numbers of organs are not there where we need them the general idea is innovate your way out of this for example allow some donors to decide for themself how their organs will be used for example i myself would have no problems with my organs being donnated to a poor schlob who never won anything to specify that if my reccipient has plans like climb mount everrest ride the bike or have an active and healthy social life go tell him to fck himself and prioritise the bottom of the list these people whom you wouldnt trust with a fresh vegan liver give them my liver put a smile on their faces shit on the guy who plans to run with the bulls or who has an instagramm account donnate your heart to the bottom of the transplant waiting list your liver to an recovering alcoholic your skin to someone who looks like a two and otherwise would need skingrafts from their own ass and your dick to someone who put chronic masturbation under hobbies let my shit go to people who actually appreciate it not take it for granted i could see a lot of people out of their free will donnating their organs and actually feeling good about it skin blood liver shit i take it like with the computer if anything can be reused before you toss it into the biohazard bin and burry it in an abandoned mineshaft be my gust grab what you need to when it is clear that i dont need it anymore just dont give it to the prick with the hope and stars in their eyes give it to themiserable bastard that has never won anything and make them for once feel like they own the world the downside would be that you would actually have to respect those wishes and such you know i will not be around to check anymore but i am sure it would be a hoot to tell mister schmidt from b that the medical board has a heart for him even though the medical board cant legally give that heart to anyone else but too often when a board decides who gets the organs and who gets a second chance i wanna wipe the smug grins off of their faces and go yea she ugly as fuck but shes a two so the rmeistermalkav clause grips and she gets his skin yes all of it see what she needs cut off the rest make a trendy bag out of it and this is where i see the problem the doctors would never agree to actually respect the donors wishes and hand over their power they would allways push for this little bit of extra of finger waving of such and of course there would be the the people that go i want my body parts to go to someone who is white i know it is harsh but better then publically whining about how fewer transplants we will have because more and more people will surive would be to take the good with the bad just increase the numbers every racist bastard who gets his wish means one fewer place on that list needing to be filled an other option would be medically assisted suicide i am dead serious on that one if all you care is get places of of that list go fuck your ethics board untill they bleed from both ends and offer assisted suicide have a suicide coaster in the back that kills you in a painless safe and guaranteed way in exchange for the right to harvest the organs of course respect these peoples wishes what they want to be done with the organs and the grafts but in the end if you are good enough to whine publically about the list let me remind you that if you pushed for harvesting rights to suicide victims bodies your numbers would look quite different yes there would be the option about not doing harm but that could be done with a patient activated mechanism or and this would be my preferred option actually look into technology look into artificial hearts look into stem cell research and make sure all your people on that waiting list understand that if they vote the people against stem cell research out of office they may actually do the world a bigger favor then by leaving them in and just signing up to be donors just you know become single issue voters for an election my best case only hand the advertising contracts to inform about organ donnations to people who are donors make fun fact sheets allow me to specify my wsh that nobody who is an sjw should get anything from me but if there is any miserable sick son of a bitch that is just a grouch give him my body and tell him to toast me once in a while staple it in and see how it goes use what you can from my body and go fuck your ethics board if you can get it out of my body without retching uncontrollably you are entitled to have it if any of my body ends up in an art project go buy a big pack of smokes for the nearest smoker and tell him my story but i would rather rot completely intact underground and make sure maggots and shit get my body then go to the afterlife with the secure knowledge that my bodyparts are taken for granted and to be distributed as seen fit by a team of medical experts

525,yet again slate projecting a future trend without also projecting the trends that other fields are likely to see why would we need organ donations in the future did medical technology completely halt while autonomous vehicle technology continued chugging along in this hypothetical future population alarmists do the same thing they project these insane numbers based on current growth rates and completely ignore the fact that with better access to technology and higher standards of living a population naturally tends to level off and reach a sustainable equilibrium and even if it didnt there is enough raw material out there in just our own solar system to construct trillions of rotating habitats each supporting billions of people with room to spare dream big slate

527,self driving cars are going to be one of the biggest epitomes of totalitarian orwellian style enslavement in the future the joking comments on here about programming them to crash and kill someone every so often actually isnt far off from what will happen in real life i can almost sense the cognitive dissonance of half sarcasm through my computer screen yes you can bet your ass that the likelihood of an autonomous vehicle mysteriously driving you off of a bridge will be higher if you end up on too many of the governments naughty lists that should be common sense for anyone with a pulse and who doesnt have their head up their ass as for the overall lowering of the mortality rate it would appear that the proponents of driverless cars are missing a very important point that a one in chance of dying due to human error is better than a one in chance of dying due to a computer error its the same reason that people who have no problem driving a car on an mile an hour highway where they know full well that they have a better chance of being killed than in a plane crash are terrified of flying and its for a good reason its not some irrational thought process that goes on in the human mind its about being in control of ones own physical well being which is a right by default it goes hand in hand with the proverb of those who are willing to give up a little freedom for a little security deserve neither and will receive none i liken the push for autonomous vehicles to the war on guns and the war on cash only to the half witted yuppie imbeciles is it about the promotion of things like safety for the common good and convenience for the individual to ignore the obvious dark side is to drink the technocratic cool aid
528,life uh finds a way seriously though with other technological advancements in d printing cloning and genetic engineering tirs wont really be a problem
529,life uh finds a way seriously though with other technological advancements in d printing cloning and genetic engineering tirs wont really be a problem
530,not really an issue consider that almost a third of all jobs in north america involve driving self driving tech will destroy those jobs and no one will be able to afford health care anyway ps they are not far from being able to grow replacement organs from stem cell but we still wont be able to afford it
531,what a problematic dilemma to have i dont think we ought to give a second thought to adopting new technologies which increase personal safety just because it will mean fewer people lose their lives to save the lives to other people
532,is there any technology on earth that does not have bugs freezes and crashes i dont think so and these cars are only in an infant state their confidence is a bit too big

536,well thats just a depressing way for me to think about awesome developments in tech
537,thats great news thats a lot of people continuing to live whereas the alternative is a lot of people dying so that some people might or might not live a little longer thankfully there has been a lot of research into artificial and lab grown organs the tech might track closely with the introduction of self driving cars or only leave a few years with a shortage also there is a lot of other medical tech that should help with the reduction of the need for organs so it looks like we are preparing i mean unless we start preparing now what the heck do they think were doing we already have a shortage with very long waiting lists we seem to be attacking this problem with all guns ablazing already and if were not then thats already the problem
538,with advances in stem cell and d printing technologies were maybe a decade or two from building replacement organs from scratch
539,the article is well written however the author doesnt address current technological advances in organ printing which could solve the issue all together for interested readers enmwikipediaorgwikiorgan_printing

541,couldnt this be decently countered by the ability to d print organs or grow them on mice or something i know both of those technologies are new but so are self driving cars and in some respects organ transplantation itself is new so im not too worried
542,when the technology exist and it becomes feasible that most of the body parts are replaceable and save able im sure larry nivens organlegging will become more popular any one on death row take down for spare parts and then the penalty for death will get much lower as people want to live longer

544,i was reading something the other day that was talking about scientists starting to have the ability to d print certain organs using the persons own tissuedna ill have to find the link sounded pretty high tech edit found it http doctor print human organ on demand
545,this is potentially bad news for recipients who cant be helped with technical solutions although those gaps will close but it also represents many lives often young lives saved the near elimination of auto accidents will usher in many complex changes there is a huge array of businesses services and professions built around what has been a tragic certainty all of them will be forced to change some will all but fade away
546,unintended consequences hopefully the tech for artificially growing organs will be better by the time self driving cars really take off and become mainstream
547,genetically engineered pig organs or nanotechnology mechanical prosthetic organs we already use both in limited fashion to replace heart parts

555,hopefully a better source of organs will come along around the time automated cars really become a thing its great that more people will be saved with this technology but i dont think its good to wave away an issue just because the number of deaths arent as high maybe im wrong and im just misreading the comment section

563,ive been working on a report of sorts on organ donationtransplantation and was in attendance at the white houses summit on this topic a few months ago generally speaking here is the current plan of attack to solve the crisis short term get more people to register as donors and get organ procurement organizations to accept new forms of registration such as social declarations on twitter facebook etc a lot of viable organs that dont get transplanted stem from next of kin not knowing the deceased persons wishes improve current practices to make donor organs last longer in between harvest and transplant and clean up organs that are considered borderline viable these practices are starting to be seen around the country but have a ways to go d printing the future solutions to completely eradicate the problem are here in their infancy still a long ways off so we need steps and to hold us over the dod is actually pouring a decent chunk of money into this technology if you can save a soldier in war with it you can eventually save civvies back at home

572,ive always maintained they should have organ donor status as the standard and have you request not to be one not everyone will be interested but i imagine it would increase the number considerably interesting point though problematic depending on how soon self driving cars will become the majority hopefully regenerative technology will be at the point or near the point where we are capable of growing a similar number of organs for transplant though that seems unlikely unless there are some massive delays with self driving cars

574,so theres a problem when improvements in technology in one area create problems in another this shouldnt generally be an issue as if technology is advancing at such a high rate on one area that it creates problems in another that usually means its because its becoming obselete but when it comes to human organs were not quite there yet this highlights a major problem in progress though technology is artifically being curtailed by the ban in stem cell research which would compensate for this concern by essentially being able to grow and replace human organs it seems like a no brainer but with the vast majority of research money in the united states which is a conservative country that just went ultra conservative this is stifling the progress of humanity the main hope would be that the research is permitted in the eu but even if perfected theres no assurances it will be licensed for use

576,technology is moving quickly both in biology and also in consumer end products i predict that it will be roughly ten to fifteen years before these cars are so mainstream that they are fully incorporated into a large majority of peoples livesalso by the looks of it growing organs looks very feasible in the near future maybe years from now yes this will be a problem but regardless these vehicles are going possibly save more life when compared to organ donations

578,kidneys can come from living donors liver can come from a living donor because it can regenerate so well living liver donation http transplantliving donationabout living donationliving liver donation you can survive with only one lung and even live normally so its the same as with kidneys living related lung transplantation http i would hand over a kidney one lung or part of my liver to a relative without thinking twice you can survive without a spleen or pancreas what else is there bladder bowels maybe but i bet you can also partially transplant intestines edit turns out that is also a thing living related small bowel transplantation so it boils down to hearts edit so the bladder is also a thing partial bladder transplantation with en bloc kidney transplant the first case report of a bladder patch technique in a human
579,thats a really stupid title thats not a problem thats called increasing quality of life instead of making it seem like people should be dying in horrific car crashes to harvest their organs lets push for organ fabrication technology sheesh

581,its ok by the time self driving cars are fully utilized the organ growth technologies will likely have caught up and be in full swing still doesnt hurt to be on full tech alert for other methods though i guess on the darker side i guess the numbers lost in vehicle accidents will be made up for in unemployed trucker suicides should no kind of basic income be established in the next years
582,this problem doesnt need a technological solution simply write a law that says that you must have been an organ donor for years or since your th birthday to receive an organ donor lists will instantly double or triple

584,this article is wrong we can already grow several organs in the lab via bio reactors that field is moving extremely fast within years well have easily solved most of the problem in regards to self driving cars removing transplant supply in that span of time the technology will have progressed enough that well be able to grow you an entirely new heart via a bio reactor

586,isnt it a little silly to say that these two processes need to or should be be related d printed organs would greatly improve medicine with or without organ donations from car crashes assuming automated cars cause less deaths that is a great improvement regardless of increased deaths from those waiting for organs how many people die in car crashes per person saved from organs obtained from a car crash how many people could be saved today with d printed organs i did some math transplants were performed in i read in or transplants come from car accidents so people were saved in from car accident organ donations however people died in car accidents so for car accidents to donor transplant every one life saved about people die this doesnt count how many of those were failed transplants i think it is fair to say lets lower automotive deaths asap about people die each year waiting for a transplant even with car crashes i think it is safe to say lets lower that via advanced technologies asap
587,you can legit spend about seconds googling the statistics the technology is still in its infancy and already has a much better reaction speed than humans this alone is a good start combine that with car to car communication and youd some colossally bad engineering to make self driving cars more dangerous than human drivers

589,we are advancing a lot when it comes to d printing and growing organs that would be made from the recipients own stem cells so thered probably be little to no chance of rejection hopefully well have that technology figured out and available to the public before the self driving cars so it wont become an issue in the first place

591,first consider in this small case were no longer saving lives were preventing accidental deaths im not sure that accounting holds true in fact i think that sort of accounting saving lives versus preventing deaths is exactly the kind of psychological impediment that humans have which leads to illogical behavior by distancing the consequences of an action from the act itself and in this case the implication whether or not you share or intend it is that the direct intervention of saving someones life is somehow different than the indirect action of saving someones live in fact the very nature of the terminology you use an accidental death ie a death without human fault due to lack of intent or human action or in a more general sense a life already forfeit to statistics implies a distance morally speaking from the action we dont have a moral obligation to protect against accidental deaths due to say meteor strikes because there is no one to fault for the meteors action once the means is available to alter the statistic of accidents such as reducing accidental cancer deaths by reducing radioactive emissions by reducing coal consumption or reducing accidental starvation by planting of dwarf wheat the decision to implement or not to implement that policy or technology becomes a moral decision with very real blood in the balance even though not taking any action was an amoral position to have before such means were available it is no longer a balance between action and accident the way we treat fault and intent leads to irrational behavior like overconsumption exploitation ignoring genocides improper alignment of prison goals and outcomes etc next while i agree i think its important to note that people are still potentially going to die one might consider both the quality and longevity of life of a person who doesnt die due to stopping very quickly and maybe being asked to occupy too small a volume versus someone who doesnt die because a failing organ has been replaced in that case one might consider a single life saved from a driving accident to be better than one life saved via an organ transplant in fact i would bet that some more in depth accounting regarding average expectations for personal achievement personal utility social enrichment utility derived through human interaction economic achievement both from creation and consumption and familial achievement having a spouse and children combined with the probably longer lifespan of a healthy person who doesnt die would mean that an objective observer would probably find it reasonable to prioritize several prevented deaths over one person saved via an organ transplant we can also consider the fraction of accident victims whose organs are compatible with a donor available within range of a suitable donor and which survive the transport and implantation procedure i dont think theres any basis for any equivalence between the death of a car accident victim and the death of a person who doesnt receive an organ transplant edit in this analysis i was basing my assumptions on major organ donations and probably some stereotypical bias of organ recipients thats probably not true although i was considering the consequences of a healthy individual versus someone living on immunosuppressants for the rest of their life and the potential for better immunosuppressants or some alternative therapy becoming available later in the organ recipients life im open to any debate on these presumptions but my overall point is that the weighting of societal benefit to the organ recipient versus the crash victim is more than a or depending on how many lives get saved from one persons organs direct equivalence im entirely open to the possibility that such accounting would tell us that killing people in car crashes and harvesting their organs is better for society than taking action to reduce car crashes at that point we end up with arguments of personal liberty etc i believe my original point that choosing whether or not to take action eg preventing people who need organ transplants from dying by banning the use of self driving cars is still a moral decision i think not taking an action becomes a moral decision once an action is available that alters the outcome of whatever is in question so categorizing something as preventing accidents versus saving lives becomes a false difference

593,man thats a technopunk writing prompt if ive ever seen one im sure theyll even call them slicers or cutters
594,just from my own general reading it strikes me self driving tech is closer to being available for general consumption than the techniques required for auto transplantation just a hunch i admit
595,we should continue to fund the research into growingcloningd printing organs were really not that far from that technology being a reality
596,we should continue to fund the research into growingcloningd printing organs were really not that far from that technology being a reality
597,no this is correct the self driving car technology is already commercially viable to a large degree the tech industry is just moving very cautiously with it so as not to spook the masses right now but its going to explode the way cell phones did kids born today will likely be the last to experience a world where people drove cars in more than a novel capacity

599,i mean we already have self driving tech that works great its just mass producing it
600,fully autonomous cars still have a way to go both from a regulatory standpoint and a technological one they dont do so well in the rain poorly maintained roads or the snow even once thats solved regulations need to be updated by agencies that are perpetually in the past

602,self driving tech is leaps and bounds closer to becoming a reality d tissue printing from stem cells is exciting but it is extremely far away from practice as of yet just creating simple structural organs such as a trachea is difficult let alone organs such as large bowel
603,i must disagree with the articles pronouncement of what we need to accept the burden is on the technology developers to clearly demonstrate that their design is better than the status quo enough better to justify the added cost in the earlier days of self driving cars there was a wholly unwarranted presumption on the part of many that self driving cars were going to be absolutely safe and the general public is slowly becoming educated on the limitations of the technology if you really understand how deep learning systems operate youll know that theyre a total black box that cannot be verified to operate properly by any manner of proof its been demonstrated that changing of even a single pixel can change object classification decisions its been demonstrated that pasting small images of other signs in the blank space of signs can cause them to be misrecognized because the black block deep learning recognizers are designed to read signs at a variety of scales in the recent uber case a software failure caused the perception of a pedestrian obstacle in the middle of the road to be effectively ignored all this technology is also going to cost money itll make cars more expensive but the ability to drive away from the destination enables cars to be shared which can greatly affect the actual cost of ownership the number of cars on the road and the occupancy and eventually the need for parking spaces nevertheless if the added cost of the technology isnt balanced by a decrease in the cost of killing and maiming drivers passengers occupants of other vehicles pedestrians and bystanders we should be highly resistant to accepting these products thats not to say its the way its going to happen people were so in love with their cell phones that they failed to resist the temptation to use them while they were driving exacting an extremely high cost in lives lost and injuries that persist to the present day users are paying the price of this in their automobile insurance cost but these costs are not redeemed by the companies responsible for the manufacture marketing or sales of cell phones so far cell phone makers havent been obliged to pay for a failure to make their products safe regulation has encouraged makers to add facilities for hands free use which has not yet been proven to make them safe to use while driving indeed studies to date suggest that users still become too cognitively occupied to safely operate a vehicle and a phone together current half driving cars on the market present another danger particularly given users penchants for operating them beyond the stated capabilities defeating safety systems such as by pressing an orange into the steering wheel and so forth theres been clear evidence that reducing the drivers workload with these systems makes the driver less attentive to the task rendering them unable to assist the half driver when it malfunctions or needs to pass control back to the driver unlike airplanes where there may be many seconds before an autopilot controlled plane becomes unsafe or uncontrollable the geometry of the driving task demands sub second responses to unusual conditions

605,look im a believer in the tech eventually but the whole even our most underdeveloped models will be an improvement is speculative bullshit ive been driving since without a ticket or accident much of that through mn winters disclosure i did slip into someones bumper in a parking lot during an ice storm but was going very slow and no damage was done i have over years in my model and that clobbers the years in automated driving for sure computers will end up being better and wont be distracted or get tired still we have a long way to go to prove that the tech is consistently better than humans one needs to consider we also have a long history of hubris and over confidence in technology visa crashes all across europe this weekend leaving millions without a way to pay we found out last year that pretty much every single chip is vulnerable to attack im not against it and i get that we need to prepare people for failures but lets not over promise

607,agree completely while we should do everything in our power to minimize and mitigate any dangers and death there invariably are going to be accidents just like the first horse drawn buggies just like the introduction of trains streetcars planes and yes automobiles any new world altering technologies in transportation will come at a cost in life
608,the humans that get killed by self driving cars are most likely to blame the technology is good but human error will always be a factor in road deaths weather driving or not
609,the humans that get killed by self driving cars are most likely to blame the technology is good but human error will always be a factor in road deaths weather driving or not
610,okay im going to disagree here i completely agree that the end goal requires massive investment and will be worth every penny but i disagree that the investment has to be human life i would also add that the deathsdistance driven ratio isnt in favour of self driving cars right now so our current underdeveloped models still dont meet the criteria in the headline there are a number of new technologies that people look into that need to be trialled in industries where safety is critical aircraft and nuclear are the names that jump to mind the safety systems are tested rigorously and continually developed in light of new information designs are constantly scrutinised both in plans and once built and arent trialled unless it can be justified the investment to have a rigorous testing procedure should be paramount the uber testing procedure seems way too nonchalant considering that the fatality they caused happened when there was a single tester who was bored to distraction imagine being told there was a test nuclear reactor with a single operator distracted by their phone as much as uber are hoping to get their self driving cars to market i dont think they care enough about if they work to ever get there otherwise theyd fill each car with a small team
611,people are going to die at first get over it is probably not the greatest stance to take if youre trying to promote widespread adoption in order to flatten the learning curve for the driving algorithms when theres a perfectly viable alternative available that people have been using for years most people will be happy to say no thanks let me know when youve worked all the kinks out and then ill think about it even if they are statistically more safe in an autonomous vehicle the technology needs strong adoption because truly safe autonomous driving is going to require millions upon millions of miles driven so that nearly every combination of scenarios can be encountered and appropriately mitigated through software learning then theres the whole casualty insurance elephant in the room that no one seems to want to address

613,why does everyone just assume things are secure and wont ever be used maliciously we cant even keep hotel door locks from being hacked or a a simple database with peoples information secure but we want a complicated software system in charge of a vehicle this is a vicious cycle every time something new comes out medical tech wifi whatever corporations fail to think about security first they designed wireless insulin pumps and pacemakers with few if any security protocols in place lets put million cars on the road with that same philosophy good idea
614,no technology is infallible even with redundant redundancies
615,no technology is infallible even with redundant redundancies
616,after the tech advances to a certain point i hope it becomes illegal for humans to drive
617,is anyone actually advocating for self driving technology to be halted as a result of these accidents or is this article perhaps a self defense response to the media criticism teslaautomated vehicles have received in recent weeks there is nothing wrong with the media reporting on the failures of this new technology thats how improvements are made i have no idea why people jump straight to whataboutisms when anything even slightly critical of self driving cars is published well what about human drivers well what about them what does that have anything to do with self driving technology and the limitations that the industry currently has

619,nah you shouldnt have to just accept loss of life if self driving cars will kill people they shouldnt be on the road youre an idiot at least with human drivers theres accountability no one is held accountable for self driving cars killing people yet we have the means to make them safe wannabe tech bros like you think lives dont matter to progress lol clown
620,somehow i was betting that this was going to be the argument not that they could make railways specifically for vehicles or that some insane new method of detection will be thought up no instead its that we want to say lets just accept this i can understand it can impede progress but its not acceptable to accept casualties when more than likely the people who take advantage of this tech will not be on the receiving end of a self driving vehicle plowing into them or someone in their family
621,this idea that we should accept self driving cars killing people is questionable at least to me now self driving tech comes from private companies who owns the code eh so nobody knows whats in the code eh so therefore consider this scenario a government with less than free and democractic ideals cough china cough implements a self driving software that does not recognise certain people dissenters as humans but their death would look like a traffic accident right in fact it would be perfectly easy for a government to decide for some features ex a hijab or sunglasses or even black skin to be not human and thus eliminate undesirables in traffic accidents as long as corporations can hide behind the auto car kills less than manual car defence the life or death of every person walking down the street will be decided based on a hidden piece of code that may or may not discriminate against you oh software discrimination totally happened before i remember reading something a while back about the face unlock tech being less accurate on asians than europeans imagine this sort of thing happening with a car coming towards you
622,no accepting that is absolutely the wrong approach and is most likely going to be an disincentive for those responsible given the recent experiences there is absolutely no reason to believe in self regulating tech companies
623,yup but once we start ceding our decisions to the good judgement of technologyits all over
624,yup but once we start ceding our decisions to the good judgement of technologyits all over
625,i wonder how driver accountability will mess with things like say we have car accidents in june as it is now the fault of them falls on the individuals who caused them but now say ford motors makes autonomous cars and there are only wrecks in june but now all wrecks are fords fault and ford loses a lot of money in lawsuits i wonder how much that would discourage this technology from moving forward just thoughts i dont really know it might not have an impact at all

627,what we always seem to forget is that the technology doesnt need to be perfect it just needs to be better than what we have right now
628,what we always seem to forget is that the technology doesnt need to be perfect it just needs to be better than what we have right now
629,i think self driving cars are going to be an amazing technnological advancement and for of the situations will do good for drivers i personally am worried about a self driving cars decision making process in a trolley problem type of scenario i would hate to be deliberately killed by a self driving car in the drivers seat or as a bystander until a self driving car has the same level of self preservation built in as i do ill still be on the fence
630,i think the issue here is that we are seeking or expecting perfection within the logic of self driving cars as a software architect i do believe that the expectation is incorrect and unrealistic the realistic expectation here is that at least version of the cars should be more safer than the current averages which i do believe that currently autonomous self driving cars are way ahead of the current averages moving forward i think distributed network over cars in which all cars are aware and can communicate with other cars to share data and details about visibility speed alerts etc would be a great benefit and will increase the accuracy of the module even better in the meantime i think self driving cars should be tested and rolled out as they are the testing data that was provided by the car owners is not enough the public needs to start testing and using these cars in every day practice this is the only way we can stabilize and improve this product the public testing of these autonomous cars is the realistic test the technology will improve x the rate when we start a beta testing with retail according to the realistic expectations set i think self driving cars will be a great success cant wait

632,itd be hard for it to really like mean anything anyways we already treat traffic deaths and pedestrian deaths as inevitabilities if the crowing technological utopian point her is trained statistical models might kill fewer people in the long run and we should expect them to kill indiscriminately in the short termfuck cars if you want less deaths make driving slower and more strictly regulated dont rely on fast soulless robots to fix what fast soulless humans dont care about fixing

634,i admit im concerned at this point on a strictly personal level i plunked my modest k down for the model specifically for the autopilot i work a lot at various locations and i was all over this technology until i read about the car hitting a damn fire truck at a standstill while in autopilot mode or however you want to word it company statement is basically we told you not to rely on autopilot well thats the only reason id spend the money on this car to begin with so if its not reliable im thinking i dont need it at this point it seems im still a better driver than what theyve got going i dont hit fire trucks at a standstill or people walking their bikes across the street im a very defensive careful driver i thought they were better i think ill wait until they are

636,radiolab dilemma most of us would sacrifice one person to save five its a pretty straightforward bit of moral math but if we have to actually kill that person ourselves the math gets fuzzy thats the lesson of the classic trolley problem a moral puzzle that fried our brains in an episode we did about years ago luckily the trolley problem has always been little more than a thought experiment mostly confined to conversations at a certain kind of cocktail party that is until now new technologies are forcing that moral quandry out of our philosophy departments and onto our streets so today we revisit the trolley problem and wonder how a two ton hunk of speeding metal will make moral calculations about life and death that we cant even figure out ourselves i believe it wont work until all cars are autonomous
637,i feel like we currently have the technology to make cars safe in the event of a major crash we just dont apply it bc its inconvienient or looks dumb like a full body strap in

641,i cant seem to get behind this tech am i the only one that drives for the fun of driving as well as to take me to my destination self driving takes that away
642,there will always be flaws in technology which will victimize people the only thing is that i like driving myself on recreational occasions that shouldnt change for high impact traffic its should be good news because it will reduce traffic jams to be honest i hope to see hybrid cars that can fly drive and submarine

646,any system that can learn from mistakes and improve without feelings or personal benefit getting in the way is far superior to a human driver and human drivers as a whole all people see are the headlines designed to spark strong emotions we need to think rationally when it comes to science and technology

648,im going to be starting my masters in control systems engineering with a focus in autonomous vehicle communication in about a year my firm believer about self driving vehicles is that they are safer but only in a system composed mostly of autonomous vehicles reduce risk of human error create a self referencing grid ect this will never happen because the cost of the technology keeps it out of financial reach of most of the population so people will continue to die and we will continue this debate till were blue in the face

650,this is one of those cases where the majority needs to be forced to accept the tech for its own good against its non sensical instincts and cognitive biases oh its something new lets apply above average scrutiny where previously we didnt even think about the dangers at all i see it happen with new tech like electric vehicles as well people using gasoline like theres no tomorrow but when tesla comes around the corner everybody is suddenly very concerned with the amount of precious earths you need to create a battery ffs weve been killing the planet to get you from a to b as fast as possible and you didnt give a damn and suddenly youre concerned with lifecycle analysis how much f ing oil spills and co emissions does it take for you to realize we need to leave the oil where it is right now hypocrisy wherever you look
651,please dont take this as insensitive but humans are already killing each other with vehicles autonomous vehicles will never get duis road rage or get tired autonomous technology will only improve our vehicle mortality rates

653,the longer it takes them to develop self driving technology that has the ability to take over the entire market the better i love driving and dont want to just give up on that experience

655,i think this is the same reason itll be a long time before air travel is fully automated and there will always at least be a technician or somebody similar on board in case things go wrong right now the airline is working towards taking th first officer out of the cockpit but even that will take time to change faa rules company policy which also requires faa approval for an aircraft to be developed and approved and then for the airlines to be looking to buy a brand new fleet which requires new support staff new multi million dollar simulators etc and thats too still have a pilot in the plane those issues aside i cant imagine the pilot less plane will be welcomed by the general public for the exact reason you stated many see that we can develop the technology to a very safe level but there will probably always be a paranoia about it by the general public the city of atlanta tried to put in a conductorless metrotrain and there was such an outcry about it the city pays somebody to sit at the front in a uniform but no controls to do anything i dont remember the exact story and cant find a source but its a story a heard about might be bullshit but i think the point is the same about people freaking out about it as driverless cars become more popular people may become more accepting of it but only time will tell

657,as a researcher i dont think perception capabilities are nearly good enough and it terrifies me that self driving cars are on the road and perception is just one of the many aspects of self driving car technology

659,at least self driving technology would improve and learn from the thousands of mistakes made around the network until it decides fuck it kill them all

664,just reading the title i know many people think like this and the logic seems sound initially but when it comes down to it how can you support this without at least questioning your own morality risking lives to save more lives seems to make sense but why do people need to be put at risk in the first place for the technology to develop can it not be developed without the need to put people at risk im all for progress but i despise this type of thinking let me know if you think im wrong

668,i feel like people are so afraid of change that as soon as there is one bad sign they freak out bad stuff happens regardless of technology people die every day because of human error the future is autonomous cars so its time to embrace the future and move it along quicker because the faster we move it along the faster that it can be safe

670,tldr scary to use humans to test new tech the world is desensitized to loss of human life similar to companies under the fda autonomous vehicle companies should prove their products are safe and effective before using you might die but thats okay slogan this is terrifying ideology for example a woman killed her newborn in a town elsewhere in my state by shaking it because it wouldnt eat the ct scan showed six blunt force injuries on the brain everyone finds this abhorrent how is abortion not on the same page a human fetus is a human too i digresspeople die in cars and that is a terrible thing to happen someone dies in an autonomous vehicle and thats for the cause someone getting killed is such a desensitized event in the world now that the selling point for future tech egautonomous vehicles is that some people will die during testing and that is okay some people died at sandy hook elementary was that okay in order to improve security at schools no and if you think it was you extremely need to rethink some things about yourself heres the reality of the situation loss of life is never okay every person is unique and wonderful and beautifully made never should there be technology or ideas that we explore where human mortality is not the utmost concern autonomous vehicles shouldnt be sold under the notion that youre an early user so you may die but thats a sacrifice we are willing to make because our product is better at driving than you a la lord farquad youtubehikuxfcsreu its nonsensical death comes for us all thats the consequence of our sin yes we accept that but sacrificing people for technological advancements isnt that illegal not to mention hugely unethical enmwikipediaorgwikiunethical_human_experimentation read the united states section the kefauver harris drug amendment to the federal food drug consumer act requires companies to prove safety and effectiveness of their products theyre prioritizing human life and wellness now as law requires why arent autonomous car companies trying to sell their products with the focal selling point being the best safety and effectiveness too surely this is being investigated surely the autonomous vehicle companies arent experimenting why should we accept a product that isnt proven effective and safe in the highest degree i dont think we should accept it not until its been shown to be safe there are good and bad drivers on the roads every time we get in a car we risk our lives but we take penicillin because we know its been proven effective and safe and labeled as such i drive my particular car because its been proven safe and effective at keeping me that way i buckle my seatbelt for the same reason its proven to be safe and effective why shouldnt an autonomous vehicle be subject to the same parameters im okay with downvotes felt like adding my two pence this is a hot topic rall we need to be discussing this

676,hmmm in other autopilot type environments such as aircraft ships etc there are two variables that wont translate well into the autonomous vehicle situation cars are maintained in a vastly different manner professional maintenance teams of highly trained persons ensure all the systems are operating properly and even then things fail with the home user neglecting repairs maintenance there will never be the same level as in the professional transportation industry think along the lines of an old unsafe car burning oil because the owner doesnt maintain the car people will never be as diligently trained as the professional transport industry they wont care theyll play around with the technology and cause general mayhem think your neighbor burning rubber you son that keeps getting into accidents or those motorcycle riders that are aggressive to the point of being dangerous there will need to be a fundamental change in these two arenas to have a functional safe and efficient av

679,dont like all this tech advancement that we dont really need people just need to drive better tech is ruining the world
680,no we dont have to accept that we can just build transit systems that are intrinsically safe instead of retaining the horse and buggy without the horse now with a computer trying desperately to emulate a human which is brutally hard skytran for instance if you have to design in criteria like ok we have an emergency who should the car kill pedeistrains or the occupants youre designing a shitty ass useless system that has no justification for existing i just cant believe this massive blind spot everyone seems to have cars are a bad technology for transporting people theyre also a very bad technology for transporting goods both those things can be done immensely better with something like maglev rail passive or active maglev depending on size people traffic on the local plane should be walking cycling or electric buggies that move pretty slow the transit systems that move people further should be at least meters in the air to make collisions impossible why wouldnt we build faster safer and cleaner options naah its too hard and you have to build too much lets just keep maintaining these stupid ass expensive roads and kill people on them with metal boxes hurtling out of control that makes so much more sense what

692,totally agree everyone here seems to think the tech already exists and is completely safe when the best that is out there is enhanced cruise control long long way before fully autonomous
693,those rubes just thought of a cool technology and just jotted it down to stuff that will probably be had in the future not with actual analysis of the technology this tech already exists and is already better than human drivers
694,those rubes just thought of a cool technology and just jotted it down to stuff that will probably be had in the future not with actual analysis of the technology this tech already exists and is already better than human drivers
695,but this technology already exists
696,but this technology already exists
697,it depends on the level of augmentation if you allow the driver to relax it can be a lot worse as they are no longer paying attention to the road this is why tesla now forces you to basically keep your hands on the wheel but safe driving demands constant attention ai assist could be helpful but more autonomy can mean unsafe driving until the tech is perfected
698,some people physically cant drive theyre projected to be far less dangerous than human drivers excellent idea if companies are sued into bankruptcy i guess itll be less litigious parts of the world that see this inevitable technology thrive

700,i mean im guessing it goes through a painful amount of testing and scenarios until its ready but then humans do something out of the cars protocol or someone makes a really bad miscalculation that causes a death i dont see why people should live in fear of failure of technology then nothing would advance its just unavoidable

706,yeah who cares if they invent a technology that saves a million lives every year if its not perfect kill them for it
707,i dont think people are afraid of the technology i think people are opposed to giving up one more piece of control over their lives in the name of a progress that promises nothing in return but another layer of bubble wrap between them and the world
708,i dont think people are afraid of the technology i think people are opposed to giving up one more piece of control over their lives in the name of a progress that promises nothing in return but another layer of bubble wrap between them and the world
709,because technical people realize how intractable a problem it is to actually make a self driving car and know we dont have the technology yet but profit driven corporations are getting legal protections to test the technology anyway

713,because money and military tech
714,so what youre saying is that itll become another manufacturing expense that gets passed along to the consumer insurance will still make their money gouging manufacturers and manufacturers will pass it along to the consumer with a bit of markup for their trouble what that means for the immediate future is that cars with autonomy features will be more expensive than they otherwise would as the roads adjust to having more autonomous vehicles and fewer humans and as autonomous vehicles get safer the rates insurance companies will have to charge to turn a profit will go down assuming regulators arent corrupted by the insurance lobby the amount they can charge the manufacturer will be capped and so the cost to the consumer will decrease commensurately basically itll have the same cost curve as a function of time as any other major technology thats inherently unsafe but also incredibly useful

716,correct manufacturers will be liable if the self driving car they made causes an accident of course this assumes full automation of the vehicle but it could still be before we see the majority of cars on the road being fully automated in semi automated cars there is still some role for the driver who could be held liable as a result of their actions regarding profitability id assume having contracts with manufacturers will be based on the number of vehicles they have sold meaning there will still be the same number of risks to pay for of course the pricing of these contracts may end up being less profitable than when it is done on an individual basis self driving cars also have high costs of repair due to the technology in one compared to traditional cars on the other hand if self driving cars cause less accidents there will be fewer claims and so it may cancel out

718,as far as ive heard most cars with self driving tech are already far ahead of people
719,many people driving should never have been allowed to in the first place the testing is an absolute joke while i would agree that technology is capable of driving better than many people thats not exactly saying much
720,many people driving should never have been allowed to in the first place the testing is an absolute joke while i would agree that technology is capable of driving better than many people thats not exactly saying much
721,yeah i mean id rather be killed in a massive rocket failure during re entry if i had to pick a technology related death but more realistically it would be something like having a roomba knock over a book shelf trapping me then the stupid robot would bang against my head repeatedly trying to navigate away while i slowly succumb to dehydration

723,i agree and its not just reddit its the industry too a colleague went to a transportation conference and shared his experience with us almost everything was about autonomous cars with very little emphasis on public transit or how the tech can be applied to public transit networks in an ideal world id like to see the tech improve existing public transit with cars filling in the gaps that arent covered adequately like the person who commented about his shiftslocation in this thread its sad because i really believe that this tech can provide cheap reliable and efficient transportation with no reason for anyone to own a car but it seems like the focus is on everyone owning a driverless car that will sit in the lot of the time in other words how can we sell as many cars as possible
724,im actually pretty optimistic about self driving being safer than the average human but like any new tech we need to make sure its properly regulated and like any business model we need to make sure liability and profit are in the right places in order for the market to function to the general good there will be cases where a self driving car will kill someone that an alert human driver would not there will hopefully be a lot more cases where a self driving system will avoid a fatal incident that a distracted driver would not the former will be easy to measure and should be properly investigated the latter we will only be able to understand statistically that doesnt mean that we should give more weight to the former but it does mean that we need to carefully and continuously weight the costs and benefits of using such automation when competing implementations exist we need to ensure that the most financially rewarding option for manufacturers is to continually improve safety not to pass liability to blameless consumers or hide behind hard to measure statistics placing the liability for such incidents squarely on manufacturers is the only way to adequately incentivise the behaviour that we want to see
725,the technology has not been proven to be more safe than an average driver all of the companies with self driving cars combined have not driven enough miles for an average driver to have had even a single fatal accident they have had multiple accidents most likely some of the companies like uber that have had a fatal accident are actually much less safe than a typical human driver

727,this tech already exists and is already better than human drivers except for when they mistake the occasional pedestrian for a fuzzy patch on their camerabut you guys seem to conveniently leave that out for mysterious reasons
728,yeah the tech still seems pretty shitty and still heavily relies on a human driver making the hard calls its frankly a misnomer to call them self driving at this point its more of an advanced cruise control then anything were a long way from true self driving
729,in america i am janitor in former sovuet union i am physicist moscow polytechnic go polar bears
730,my thoughts exactly itd be ridiculous to hold the manufacturer fully accountable that would jack up the price of cars and thats unfair to people who go safer routes keep up on maintenance and pay attention in order to catch mistakes before they happen i dont want to pay for other peoples decisionslaziness it would however make sense to have manufacturers pay a small portion like in cases where its determined if possible that the self driving technology was at fault that would encourage them to continue working to make the tech safer

732,first of all the average us driver has one accident roughly every miles in google announced that its self driving cars had done miles in a wide range of conditions without an accident but more to the point the technology has improved over time and is still being improved its gotten safer and safer with each passing year
733,first of all the average us driver has one accident roughly every miles in google announced that its self driving cars had done miles in a wide range of conditions without an accident but more to the point the technology has improved over time and is still being improved its gotten safer and safer with each passing year
734,how many times has that happened more importantly is a human driver or a self driving car more likely to kill a pedestrian so far out of all the tests theyve killed a grand total of one person this tech is also advancing really fast and itll be much better a few years from now
735,the problem really is that self driving technology will diffuse responsibility for deaths that it causes lets say that a self driving car kills someone and later its proven in court that if the programming had been slightly different the death wouldnt have occurred who is at fault for that do you blame the programmer what if its a team of programmers who all collaborated to write the software what if they were just programming the way the middle management told them to what if middle management was just trying to adhere to strict deadlines set by the ceo what if the ceo says he has to have those deadlines to fulfill his fiduciary duty to shareholders et al when an entire company is at fault the responsibility is diffused and the only real solution is that the company pays a settlement to the family of the dead this allows for companies to get away with murder if the settlements are less costly than improving their software

739,the real kicker is that it will actually jack up your manual insurance prices self driving cars cause less accidents and the manufacture is sued they will be pooled seperatly as more people use them there will be less people in the manual pool these people also have more liability as each death does not cost an insurance company the same amount an automated car can make a mistake but it cant be negligent negligence texting drinking etc cost more with fewer people pooling money to cover larger liabilities your premiums will skyrocket at some point choosing to manually drive could be considered a risky behavior as well as unsexy as it sounds rising insurance premiums will be the force behind the adoption rate of this tech

741,originally you said things are going to be perfect over time and now youre saying they are perfect now the fact of the matter is automated cars are not monolithic there are many ways of constructing different automated cars and many varying conditions under which they may operate you are basically saying automated cars are magical therefore we wont need insurance how is insurance relevant to a ridiculous article which completely ignores huge glaring facts you ask thanks im glad you asked that well we live in a world where accidents happen an imperfect world at least i domaybe you live in a perfect world so basically the world that most people live in involves insurance so while a year old gizmodo or nextweb or whatever author may wish something to be true its not yet true and may not be true for years or even years because differing technologies take different rates to mature the past does not predict the future and just because weve had one type of computing revolution which happened in one decade does not mean that any other potential technology revolution that we happen to like will necessarily happen at the same pace in another decade sad but true personally im guessing we will see a wide adoption of commercial partial automation of large semi trailers on certain highways in certain times of the years and certain weather conditions via optical sensors in years but i could be wrong it may be more like or and it may require a lot more expensive sensing equipment which granted may take less time to come down in price but we as laypeople dont know that right now therefore insurance law will need to adapt over time and insurance will not become irrelevant in likejune of this year its completely relevant and in fact its codified into the law at least in my state and im willing to bet every state

749,i like that train of thought but i dont put much stock into that being a thing in my life time multiple owners of one car means there will be times when you cant use it uber style would be more expensive than owning unless you travel very short distances very rarely like leasing a car whether you own a car or partake in a futuristic uber program you essentially pay per mile you drive even when you factor in selling the car eventually changes a little if you dont drive much with uber style the cost per mile is unavoidably higher because you have to pay for someone to clean it the technological infrastructure and wages to make car sharing possible insurancecost splitting in case people vandalize or damage the interior or exterior someone to do simple everyday maintenance like change the wipers and the cost disadvantage of buying a new car if youre someone who usually buys used cars then factor in the fact that the company organizing the scheme and any companies involved with aspects of it would be trying to turn a profit youve got more middlemen between you and the manufacturer if elon musks automation scheme works out and cars end up getting way cheaper in the future the cost disadvantage for uber style ownership might be less of an issue but actual ownership will always be cheaper

751,maybe im misunderstanding what youre saying but it sounds like that guy was trying to do a proper zipper merge while all the rest of you were merging improperly i used to merge like youre describing by getting over as early as possible but after researching this ive started using the zipper method its safer faster arstechnicacomcarsthe beauty of zipper merging or why you should drive ruder and more efficient mergeasp the only issue is that lots of people are unaware and think that youre being an asshole by merging at the last second
752,like i said that includes from times when the technology was less advanced a self driving car from a few years ago had more flaws than one today does so its not really comparable furthermore most accidents by self driving cars have been due to human error ie when human drivers made mistakes during interactions

754,uber are desperately attempting to catch up with waymo in the autonomous vehicle scene the pilot intervention statistic in that article is from them not waymo or other platforms which have statistically have far fewer cases of intervention the biggest failure with the uber fatality is allowing the platform on public roads without adequate government scrutiny more reputable companies may have pushed for those laws but in the end it is up to law makers to ensure the safety of public roads not to dismiss uber are absolutely to blame as well telsa auto pilot also is basically glorified lane assist and shouldnt be included when considering the safety of proper autonomous vehicles with lidar systems which at the moment are essential so for competent companies with proper systems the fatality rate is zero and from my knowledge the number of accidents where the self driving vehicle is at fault is zero or in the single digits this technology is already proven it is on the near horizon and will radically change the world making millions of jobs obsolete we should be planning for that outcome not scoffing its inevitability

756,lol nah yeah should have put only one pedestrian however they still are far safer than human drivers and the technology hasnt even been perfected yet lemme ask you though that subset of the population that can only afford to get to work in their dollar beater we kill those people right or do you have some magical thinking ubi bullshit that miracles that problem away too uhhh no itll take a bit for them to become mainstream but once it is we can just have services where you order a self driving car from your phone kind of like an automated uber and if you want to buy a car theyll be the only thing available theyll end up being affordable and actually carry far lower insurance premiums of course most jobs are going to be automated out of existence and well start feeling more and more of the pressure when these come out especially since theyll kill a lot of transport industry jobs ubi or some other program is going to be necessary when most people are out of work

758,tbf the area is not as poorly lit as the uber video suggested someone who lives in the area posted photos here on reddit even if that were accurate the car uses sensors in addition to simply visible light thats one of the appeals of self driving cars they can use sensory inputs not available to our meaty bodies the sensors on the uber car detected the person and the software registered the sensors detecting her as a false positive and made no attempt to avoid her an attentive human driver would not have killed that woman im all for self driving cars but ubers tech was not road ready if that situation yielded a false negative googles cars have far more hours on the road and nothing like that incident

761,in what way i dont think i said anything particularly controversial i thought you might even agree with me on the need for better regulation of this type of technology i think we both agree that allowing potentially dangerous vehicles on the road is unacceptable but the question is what happens when they are demonstrably more safe than human drivers

765,cars are space inefficient and in an ideal world we would rebuild all our cities each year to reflect technology however driverless cars are a better way to use the existing infrastructure which is far to expensive to replace than anything else if to many cars on a road would lead to traffic driverless cars wouldnt use the road a good system would ensure everyone got were they wanted to be as fast as possible if that means one person not going on a road and taking a mile detour so he it again this is not the type of driverless car that is being built unfortunately

769,you are making very little sense now an ideal traffic solution is based on incredibly efficient technologies we have had for a century and a half now the train the apartment building and the bicycle you still have not managed to get your head around the fact that cars take up more space per person than all existing transportation solutions and this is why it is inferior the fact that the infrastructure for it already exists is not an excuse as i said in another comment an easy solution that does not work is not a solution its an addition to the problem
770,i think its gonna be a while before we trust the technology to completely replace you think not only about the technology but all the legislation necessary to make this a viable thing washington dont move that fast youre probably good for a while lol

772,a thing to take note of is that most self driving marketing has focused on consumer vehicles i cant recall a single ounce of hype regarding commercial trucking despite it being a gold mine for self driving technology and having relatively simpler use cases further you may note that most self driving demonstrations are in highly controlled environments the technology is just too limited at the moment so id wager five to ten years until you see general application for just average drivers regarding trucking theres likely never going to be a point where you have no driver involved not that the technology wont be able to replace but because the risk factor is too large ai applications invariably have a margin of uncertainty its just how the world works when youre talking about the scale of how far commercial trucking must travel and the economic cost of a damaged shipment not to mention the collateral of a truck crashing into something its just more economic to hire a driver as a failsafe there will likely be pay cuts since you become a glorified babysitter but it doesnt make sense to me to simply eliminate the profession

774,the technology is still pretty crappy i think there are other issues in the trucking industry that are more pressing driver shortagehtml driver shortagehtml i just now started trusting my taffic jam assist system to work most of the time it is pretty good but even in that limited capacity it still needs to be watched like a hawk autopilots for planes are much better but there has been a lot more years of development of the three axis coupled auto pilot and auto throttle compared to self driving systems flying is fundamentally less complex than driving you dont fly really close to other planes and you dont fly right behind one that could do something wild unexpectedly right now the human computer is better than the electric one at driving a car

780,i think the answer here much like farming nowadays is learn to code i dont think truck drivers will necessarily go away but the job will change i think itll largely be split into different fields tech and mechanics i completely agree with you on the baby sitting part and thats where either of those roles come in things will always break and i think were unlikely to see ai improve so much that we see self driving cars capable of fixing their own issues thinking flat tires mostly
781,why not get into the trades electrician hvac tech plumber carpenter mason etc etc those jobs will never go away and will never get outsourced you need a human right in front of you those jobs also exist almost anywhere and pay very well
782,if you are a electrician or hvac tech those are my trades making less than or k in my area which is the midwest with low cost of living then you work for a really shitty company in larger cities commercial hvac techs frequently make to bucks per hour while also in a union with amazing benefits read free healthcare and a pension i can tell you with absolute certainty as someone who is actually working in the trades most of us make more than a rn at a major hospital
783,there are literally thousands of different directions a md can take you spend a while looking a job listings that arent clinical but require an md tech for sure will have some jobs
784,hardware failure is an expected risk its natural people would be weary of new technology and its reliability

788,the cartoon iswella cartoon putting self driving cars or trucks on the road is a process you dont just throw a bunch of driver assistance technology into a vehicle and say welp its self driving right now were at the point where an autonomous vehicle needs someone behind the wheel just in case were getting there but were not there yet soon

790,i like unions advocating for workers and wages and things like that but unions advocating against new technology should be illegal they are doing nothing but ultimately harming workers in the long run if they do that

792,it could have been the computer or another electronic in the trunk i left the company in so who knows what kind of insane improvements or tech theyve put in the vehicles since then but to me this is the closest i can think of
793,mans greatest technical advancement the pinnacle of our accumulated knowledge and discoveries accomplished by standing on the shoulders of giants used to get tacos and tequila seems about right
794,i like their approach deploying the technology in small increments while scaling up and improving it this decreases the risks and gives people time to get used to the idea i cant wait for them to go full scale

796,im not sure about the law but i would think tesla needs specific approval waymo can only drive in phoenix technically and legally now tesla will be able to drive everywhere but when they will be allowed to do so will depend on when the various jurisdictions allow them well have to see how capable their soon upgrade will be but assuming it works as well as theyre claiming i would still expect there to be a couple of more years before its able to drive with essentially zero need for human interjection
797,you misunderstand first let me clarify my statement i am saying that it would take tesla more than years to create something as confidentreliable as this video with their current hardware and i know they plan on continuing with this hardware as that is their strategy and they have been promising fsd with this current hardware take a company that is pretty good at innovating i agree tesla is great at innovating and an extremely exciting company however for them to create what you see in this video with their hardware and strategy will several times harder than what waymo has done it will require vastly more technology breakthroughs that are not in the foreseeable future if tesla were to drop their current strategy and hardware and start over and create a waymo clone i am sure they could do that in years or so but they do not intent to do that when you have pretty much half a million cars or more collecting driving data worldwide on edge cases sigh you and everyone else have got to drop this man its a useful tool but is really far less relevant and important than you believe waymo has at last publishing in a fleet of vehicles even if they quadrupled that its still less than vehicles out in the wild collecting data irrelevant i dont think its a hardware issue at this time its more getting the software right yes but when you have less hardware redundancies the software doesnt need to be a little better it needs to be x x times better k people that already bought it its going to be a massive change only k its gotta be higher than this tesla is selling k vehicles per quarter years is probably my best case idea for teslas software to be at this level we are seeing i share your excitement and enthusiasm its fun to dream i agree wouldnt that be something if that turned about to be the case but i hope you arent getting in to deep into the fantasy

799,i worry about this a lot maybe not exactly the way you put it but i worry that the entire industry will be delayed while waymo reaps monopoly profits at the beginning our patent system is pretty much setup to allow this just like drug breakthroughs its hard to see something this beneficial to all of society have to go through that process sometimes even if it only happens because of the draw of the profits i believe they will always have to compete with manual cars to some degree maybe in the very distant future they wont but at that point there should be no technology moats to block competition

801,i still think you would benefit from a drivers license it will be a while before this technology is everywhere you may need the ability to drive on rare occasions
802,i still think you would benefit from a drivers license it will be a while before this technology is everywhere you may need the ability to drive on rare occasions
803,but why not get a license and leave at home all times ive never driven since i did a bare minimum to get one kind of like you but it might help you experience the tech unrolling in front of you
804,is that a bad thing how else would you like to see this technology or learn about it

806,i am super excited for sdcs from a technological and general convenience standpoint i am an engineer so i love the tech and of the time i would not mind having my car drive itself while i nap or work or whatever the only thing that gives me pause however is that sometimes i use my car in ways that i dont think sdcs will easily support sometimes i like to take the long way home just to unwind and see the scenery sometimes i just drive to the park during lunch and take a nap in my seat sometimes i sit for longer than necessary in the walmart parking lot in order to catch up on texts sometimes i pull a sudden u turn because i saw something interesting i still support the development because safety trumps all of these little conveniences but still im a little sad to potentially lose that kind of freedom

808,first youre assuming self driving means it cant take direction from a human obviously thats not the case youre also not considering other technological advances for example you could launch a drone to track a fleeing suspect also self driving motorcycle riiiigght no thanks not that im sure why youd need one but its been done with a human passenger im sure a small three seater would be more appropriate if you had a situation where a car wouldnt work

810,first youre assuming self driving means it cant take direction from a human not at all youre also not considering other technological advances for example you could launch a drone to track a fleeing suspect irrelevant unless there is some kind of thought control a self driving car will not be able to be directed by a human as well as a human could manually drive it whether it is with a steering wheel joystick or some kind of virtual reality interface there will always be the necessity in certain vehicle roles that need manual control not that im sure why youd need one because this conversation started by someone suggesting that manual driving would cease to exist entirely

812,not at all and yet in the example youve given it seems trivial for a human who can fully devote his attention to tracking a subject and giving voice commands to the vehicle can be more effective and much safer also while it may be a matter of semantics its possible for a vehicle to be self driven and still have a joystick or other interface for granular human control while the vehicle itself actual retains control and ensures safety because this conversation started by someone suggesting that manual driving would cease to exist entirely you didnt answer the question why do motorcycles need to exist lots of technology comes and goes as new technology takes over

814,no that is no longer autonomous you could just as easily say that about a vehicle that accepts voice commands i didnt realize you were suggesting banning them how about this motorcycles need to exist because have this thing called freedom where things arent outlawed just because they dont conveniently fit into your idea of how thing should be there are endless limitations and rules governing what vehicles are street legal today freedom never has been and never will be absolute if as i suspect at some point society finds there are enough advantages to allowing exclusively self driving vehicles on public roads then it will likely happen and if enough people want to buy self driving motorcycles then somebody will make them although that sounds like a nightmare to me if you want to be against that thats fine but theres no need to invent dubious technological reasons it cant happen just say youre against the idea on its merits as long as enough people agree with you youll be fine sdcs are supposed to give us more freedom not less and if your only solution to problems is to take away existing options you really dont deserve a place in the conversation you dont get to define what people want from self driving cars nor who gets a place in the conversation thankfully

819,i think that regulation will fall away in due time we have no driver in the vehicle and the systems are getting better for instance google has been driving exponentially more and the technology is still getting better you dont mass produce vehicles unless you think they should need mass producing this isnt a car order here

821,yeah i mean pushing the date back happens in many projects also it could still not be all that far off i think they see uber and see that they could undercut that business model and are trying to get it into that market the technology is close to being ready for normal people right now it is in beta testing with hopeful signs

823,i dont think you are disagreeing with me that much all these companies imo want a patent that will potentially make billions from the uber like companies like maybe alphabet isnt the company that wants that task of running a self driving car transportation network but also that doesnt mean the technology isnt almost there

825,i feel like this is going to be developed by actuaries at insurance companies not by engineers mobileye specializes in designing the tech not in paying for the damages
826,damn i just learned about the levels earlier today after studying the tech loosely for the last few years and im seeing this now
827,technically they would be crashing into non automated cars
828,it says potentially it also says they arent yet having enough success with regular lane keeping technology to roll it out all the way
829,it says potentially it also says they arent yet having enough success with regular lane keeping technology to roll it out all the way
830,my opinion is that ditching these things too fast would greatly slow adoption of the technology theyre better off having people who own these cars think wow this technology is so good that i never touch the steering wheel anymore then start offering the car without it
831,my opinion is that ditching these things too fast would greatly slow adoption of the technology theyre better off having people who own these cars think wow this technology is so good that i never touch the steering wheel anymore then start offering the car without it
832,all of the naysayers in this thread fail to see one thing autonomous vehicles will drastically reduce injury and death due to collisions k deaths and m injuries per year from car accidents in the us humans suck at driving the faster we take away all control from humans the more lives will be saved yes there will still be accidents yes the autonomous tech will fuck up and cause accidents yes cars will get hacked and fly off the road but with all of this considered tens of thousands of peoples lives will be saved every year
833,there likely wont be anyone to sue because there will be no negligence what were going to see is a vast reduction in rule breaking autonomous cars wont run red lights or stop signs they will use their blinker when changing lanes theyll give right of way at roundabouts if there is a fatal accident it will be very difficult to prove negligence that would result in a valid lawsuit most likely it will be the owner of the autonomous car suing the manual driver there will be cases where the autonomous tech fucks up and in that case the auto maker will be sued it will likely be a class action suit because it will require expert analysis to prove it was the techs fault
834,self driving cars wont be the norm for a long long time think about the thousands of cars you see every day wherever you live they arent going anywhere anytime soon especially as cars are nicer safer and more reliable than theyve ever been even a car from doesnt seem as old today as a car from did then a car likely wont feel that old in barring some massive unseen tech advance on the level of the smartphone the poor people who cant afford anything but a year old beater what would they do what about all the year old classics people still own and drive today human driven cars will be around for at least the next few decades if not the rest of the century
835,likely be electric by then so no gearbox needed edit you dont need one but it can help with performanceeconomy or just use two different motors link cleantechnicacomev transmissions are coming and its a good thing
836,people get caught up in tech demos which self driving cars are the edge cases and real problems are behind the scenes and tens of years away from the first real devices to be sold look at this video of a blind man getting mcdonalds in a self driving car my tesla can make turns on the freeway and change lanes google has self driving golf carts for years they see these things and think that the future is just around the corner the proof of concept is there but anyone who has had a poc thrown at them and told to release it knows what it takes to get to the next level years they will tell you which means nothing self driving cars exist existing and getting something to market is an exponentially larger problem
837,self driving cars will be here by society will decide how fast we adopt the technology
838,self driving cars will be here by society will decide how fast we adopt the technology
839,thing is old cars can be converted into self driving cars relatively easily the big obstacle to self driving cars is solely software im a car person myself and rather enjoy driving but the benefits of self driving cars way outweigh my desire to drive a car myself already in the scenarios self driving cars are capable at self driving cars are far safer than human drivers and their ability to communicate and react perfectly to each other means traffic would be a thing of the past the technology is likely to be ready in less than years id give it years until they makeup the majority of the cars on the road and until human drivers are illegal on public roads

841,i think you may undervaluing the number of lawsuits manufacturers get hit with that are caused by human error but for the purpose of recovery allege a defect id be willing to bet that manufacturers will ultimately bet on themselves because as the technology gets better there will be less and less accidents leading to less and less lawsuits

843,you might be missing my point adoption of this technology meaning customers buying it is more about psychology than tech for quite a few years initially a majority of people are going to be watching intently for news stories that say robot car kills occupants if it also says robot car kills helpless occupants who were unable to manually control vehicle and were screaming as it drove them off of a cliff the industry will be set back for a decade the early adopters risk takers are good but they arent enough to make this take hold not to mention there are people alive who just enjoy driving

845,no i agree but your original position was that there were conditions self driving cars should never lose the steering wheel because the cars cant navigate those situations technology needs test cases to develop ways to adapt to those conditions and construction zones totally can be adapted around heavy snow or wind are not easily adapted to and will be harder to develop for the technology i described does exist currently its just not used in the real world because self driving cars are a fringe case construction companies are not planning for

847,because its really easy to name a ton of situations where self driving cars would get stuck no matter how good they are construction zones for instance or road closures there are so many instances where a self driving car would get stuck that it makes no sense to not have the ability to manually take control its bad enough having cars break down causing traffic backups imagine how many backups will be caused by a self driving car going well dont know what to do ill just stay here and wait for someone to i guess push me out of the way but wait can you even push the car if no one can steer it wait for a tow truck to tow it because its ai cant figure out the situation removing steering wheels is an idea way ahead of the curve of a technology that is in its infancy its the last thing that you will do not one of the first

849,thats why i said society will decide how quickly we adopt the technology
850,thats why i said society will decide how quickly we adopt the technology
851,theyll deal with other bad drivers much better than a human ever could its all whats coming is there any possible way to avoid it all faster and without hesitancy compared to a callable human brain construction workers will be supplemented and eventually replaced by new tech that works with self driving cars the weather and special circumstances thing will require a human driver for the foreseeable future though theres no reason radar advances and stuff cant eventually help with weather
852,i never said we wont be able to drive cars that doesnt mean we wont have them do most of the work companies already have technology that can deal with everything you mentioned the issue again like i said is how fast society will decide to adopt the technology
853,i never said we wont be able to drive cars that doesnt mean we wont have them do most of the work companies already have technology that can deal with everything you mentioned the issue again like i said is how fast society will decide to adopt the technology
854,i literally said its up to society to decide how fast the technology is adopted
855,i literally said its up to society to decide how fast the technology is adopted
856,what do you mean years away tesla already has mostly self driving capabilities and theyre not the only ones with interests in the market the technology is literally around the corner once again society is the only thing that will hold the technology back the average person wants to trust themselves more than they trust technology but those same people use their phone for basic math instead of trusting their own intelligence

858,it is literally a lesser problem because it doesnt affect every driver all the time but still im not arguing that we should ignore the problem im saying that focusing on that problem as the reason we cant do without steering wheels ever is wrong youre good at finding all the details in your argument but ignoring them in mine honestly were still very far from true autonomous driving for a lot of reasons the biggest one being infrastructure we cant predict what the state of self driving tech will be when worrying about the weather becomes one of the big problems they move on to for all we know itll be a non issue that ends up solved by accident as a result of solving a different problem or implementing a new system i guess thats my point the snow problem for a fraction of users for a fraction of the year is not a today problem so we cant look at todays tech to point out why it cant be solved once we solve todays problems well use tomorrows tech to evaluate tomorrows problems hypothetical we end up developing some advanced sensorai system able to navigate unknown routes without needing to reference preset maps and navigation data letting people take side roads and even travel off road then they discover that routine is also able to dynamically update existing navigational data when the system detects unexpected road conditions like snow or road construction no need for a special snow sub system
859,thats precisely what i meant the technology is there but adoption is years away at least widespread where its more common to have a self driving car for the average consumer than a manually driven car theres numerous factors that limit this beyond just people wanting to trust themselves cost in an era with wage stagnation and rising costs of living there are entire demographics that have no car or can only afford to buy year old beaters every couple years these people wont be able to likely own one of these self drivers for a generation or two the middle ish class that can afford new cars within the current generation will likely hold off on adoption until its proven technology as many of these people have families that will not trust in the hands of a computer yet this leaves consumer adoption with the wealthy elite that have both need and money or the technically affluent that stays with the latest developments regulation this is probably going to be a slow nut to crack until its been proven and insurance companies get fully behind it easier than pricing but harder than the development of the tech used car market this is basically where the majority of america buys through and as i stated most car models see years in circulation overall it will take at least this long for self drivers to be widely available to consumers i expect the business market like trucking and cabs to be pushed for first and then another for non self drivers to cycle out of the market to where having a manual car is as rare as owning a car with manual transmission is today then another years where a non self driver is a classic collector type thing my year statement was that it would take that long for self drivers to be widespread ie the primary car type

861,the a senior software dev at a top software company i have also been qa for some of the time if anything everyone is vastly underestimating the dates problems and scenarios am i worried self driving cars will remove jobs yes but not for years even if self driving was perfect today it would take years to get reasonable market penetration example the first prius which was crazy popular came out in thats years ago electric cars today make up less than of cars sold self driving will take a similar road map to electric cars as they both add an additional cost to vehicles right now i would argue full self driving cars arent even at the first prius point which really only got like mpg and was pretty weak today at the consumer level we only have glorified cruise control and some cool tech and test vehicles that drive by themselves with humans monitoring them no fully automatic driving at a consumer level the first vehicles to go full ai will be long haul truckers because its the simplest problem to solve freeway only driving we dont have this yet working at a good enough level and this isnt even accounting for the politics of it its way to early to be talking about removing steering wheels
862,just replacing tech douche hipsters in the dead end street battery fail imminent
863,if tech doesnt work for people then it doesnt work
864,the problem with self driving cars is technology
865,the problem with self driving cars is technology
866,there has been ample review of the underlying technology but there are far too few discussions about the role of people what happens when we replace human judgment with technology

871,when a technology that is supposed to improve life for people is hampered bypeople it is badly designed technology
872,people who buy into this new tech are alpha testers thank god they cant wait for a couple years this way the ai will learn and get better
873,its the tech we dont have the tech
874,no its the technology
875,no its the technology
876,just like cars led to people not knowing how to saddle and bridle a horse technology moves forward we leave the antiquated behind people are bad at driving if and when reliable and safe alternatives arise why would we need to know how to do something from the past no one laments not knowing how to yoke cattle to plow fields

878,yeah train tram and bus technology
879,yeah train tram and bus technology
880,i am pretty sure the only thing that has caused a google maps autonomous vehicle to get into a wreck was a human the tech is there its the people on the roads
881,under a certain definition of design sure but its also not inconceivable that certain pre existing structures could be that which is interfering whether they be poorly designed or simply just too broadly reaching in particular im thinking of legal structures eg safer distillation methods could be hampered by prohibition laws or media streaming technology hampered by intellectual property laws we could also cook up non legalistic hampering eg any product with deliberately designed obsolescence i was going to make a fairly semantic argument about how your statement isnt strictly true however doing the one thing nobody ever seems to do actually read the thing to give your comment fair context i rescind my point and agree that it does indeed seem to be the case that the problems described therein people forgetting how to safely operate cars in the case of emergency overestimating the smartness of self driving tech in the first place are only problems in the presence of immature techpoor design

883,damn people standing in the way of new tech reminds me of the artificial dilemma often talked about should the autonomous car rather hit a elderly person or a kid the problem is in even asking that question because it implies one life being more valuable than another and unnecessarily overcomplicating things just steer left if thats not possible steer right every time i see an article like this i get the impression that either this tech debate is used to undermine basic human rights or people involved are just completely oblivious of what those are
884,the techs purpose is to interact with people if it fails at that then it doesnt work
885,the tech is most definitely not there yet and likely wont be with pure deep learning approaches
886,the tech is there for driving in phoenix or california where the weather is never too bad its totally not there for everywhere else
887,the tech is trying to sell you a self driving car that can drive on a non automated road and yes the tech is not there
888,but the people are on the roads and thats an immutable fact self driving tech has to deal with so if youre saying the tech is there as long as the roads are clear of people isnt that another way of saying the tech isnt there
889,it most likely be pure deep learning because we have no other techniques for general problems like driving you can try and if else every possible scenario but good luck with that
890,i never said the tech is there clear of people having humans crash into self driving cars will be a reality we have to continue to face as we put more of them on the road if you think we cannot move to self driving cars until they are accident free thats raising the bar much higher then humans
891,exactly thank you insanely exaggerating the capabilities of tech has become very popular and its very dangerous because most people really believe that stuff i remember some eu governments proposing internet content filters because they work sooo well on youtube discarding the fact that most of it is still filtered by hand
892,the tech is there and thats a start are not equivalent
893,lol yes it is tech evolves buddy thats how it works
894,huh theyre like opposites one effectively means weve started and the other means weve finished in so much as any technology is ever finished of course
895,huh theyre like opposites one effectively means weve started and the other means weve finished in so much as any technology is ever finished of course
896,incorrect in their previous comment they said the tech is there thats just not compatible with thats a start
897,tech is never finished and we are far from having just started do you even work in tech lol
898,optical illusions exist for humans sure but take a look at any of the images in research on adversarial image noise the image looks virtually identical after noise has been introduced but the system still breaks down i would wager times a human would still get the right answer so the question here is why is the machine breaking down again its because theres no real learning or intelligence happening and until we have that self driving tech will likely always face political headwinds as people will have safety concerns no human is going to confuse the side of a white truck for a cloud and crash into it or miss a stop sign just because someone put a little sticker on it
899,how is clearly explaining capabilities and limitations of your product deceptive anybody curious enough to spend minutes can find out what this can do on their own website and yes the car itself is capable of self driving thats the whole point but the software is still being refined why shouldnt they be allowed to market that its telling their customers that once the time comes and tesla is fully autonomous they wont have to upgrade their cars at all this argument is completely stupid because youre clinging on to the wording of one product name that is technically completely correct and completely ignoring how clearly tesla spells out exactly what autopilot can do at the present time
900,tesla isnt stupid they know they have to use legally correct wording where it counts or theyd be sued into oblivion they also know that consistently using terms like full self driving and autopilot makes their cars sound like the pinnacle of autonomous tech even when the actual abilities of those cars dont measure up to the common meanings of those terms and musks grandiose overpromising about delivering this or that fully autonomous milestone by certain dates also makes them seem like visionaries even when those dates come and go with no such achievements to be found its a nice way for them to have their legally correct cake and eat it too in the form of a reputation that outpaces their actual tech to your other point of course high profile crashes make the news so then why dont we hear about fatal crashes caused by for example waymo or cruise cars oh right because those cars arent killing anyone
901,a dirty camera means theres no input image that didnt have anything to do with adversarial attacks lol same with fog and blizzard adversarial image attacks are literally just the original image with noise added in feel free to review the research to refresh your memory an ml system ultimately needs to be able to think like a human because were not going to be able to train every situation and the public isnt going to want to get into a car they have no control over if they think its going to kill them when weather conditions arent as favorable as the weather the car was trained in it seems rather ethically dubious to widely release a technology with such glaring issues inherent to the very system the tech is built on

907,im really hoping that self driving and related tech will have a significant positive effect on road safety for responsible cyclists
908,per mile isnt necessarily the best way to balance the metric since it might include miles they are just uselessly ambling around we really need to know per trip or trip mile of actual riders we also need to know if theyre in any way pulling people out of mass transit and into cars since that is the among the worst possible results of such a service self driving cars are a necessary future but they should never be thought of as a possible primary transit option for a community they are still cars and cars are still a fundamentally bad choice for urban design a lot of people want to be tech wizards and believe that pure technology like this will fix all problems when really infrastructure and transit is a field we already have the answers for and just need to bone up and do it

920,theres a tradeoff between amount of regulation versus the speed of technological development adding regulation today would slow down development by a lot personally i think the lack of regulation today is a good thing regulation would make sense in years when the technology is more mature but not yet

923,its not only the technology that needs to be heavily regulated but the marketing and advertising auto manufacturers are making bold claims and selling this technology to normal folks who dont understand just how complex these systems are or how prone to failure they can be people are far too trusting of this tech and its going to get people killed

926,despite all of the ceos arrogance tesla is going to have to adopt lidar technology eventually this may be the linchpin to finally convince musk that yes d camera imaging is not enough they need lidar
927,its almost as if we need some sort of governing body thats competent in tech making mandates and forcing corporations to obey
928,tesla really is just a double edged sword youre getting an electric car that has all of the tech and features you could possibly want in a car you have great software cool design language and decentgreat battery range on the other hand the support and maintenance is a fucking nightmare replacement parts are either expensive as shit or nonexistent software is mostly good but some critical components like self driving arent polished the engineering on some components are way too over engineered for what theyre doing leading to horrible reliability
929,its almost like there was an independent open source community driven system out there that tesla bought out cannibalized promised to continue the mission and then turned it into a corporate slave that was bound to fail and when it did would ultimately lead to repercussions to the entire self driving technology in the us just a tid bit for folks other parts of the world are not being taken over by corporate overlords like tesla and their self driving programs are starting to look great its almost like americans want to fail at something that literally could save lives

933,but this technology is saving lives already source
934,but this technology is saving lives already source
935,but this technology is saving lives already but its also costing lives not to mention research showing autopilot is not any safer fsd only appears to be even more dangerous its called the step in problem and humans are just bad at it not to mention the predictable abuse issues other automakers actually tried to solve while tesla dug in its heels

937,most people dont understand tech and they really dont understand ai while unfortunate this sort of issue is bound to happen when developing autonomous driving ai it will get better and it will is saving lives but i think your correct people hate elon and anything they can use to justify their hatred is used this just being the latest example on a personal level i dont like elon but the tech his companies produce is unquestionably top notch
938,ill say this a million times default subs suck go look at science its so much worse default subs mean the randos who browse the front page see and comment on the default subs they otherwise would never go to its why rgames was born from rgaming being a terrible default sub or rtech being born due to this being a default
939,they want tech they just dont want unsafe tech how is that a curmudgeon thing
940,i am having trouble seeing in the validation pipeline any review and approval by external reviewers which is really standard in most physical engineering disciplines or in medical research and development or really most fields that combine highly technical skills with a public interest
941,its reasonable to enhance the mechanism of driver monitoring while the tech is being worked out makes sense
942,how is that apples to oranges its the entire purpose of developing the tech if the technology is made to improve the safety of driving and doesnt its a problem if the data shows it does then maybe it should be encouraged if you are replacing something a driver with something else a driverless vehicle then it warrants a comparison doesnt it

946,the problem is that you cant really train an ai like this by playing it safe if all it is trained on is private roads where nothing ever goes wrong then it will fail the first time it encounters something outside of spec technological progress has always required breaking a few eggs if you want to make an omelet

948,while unfortunate this sort of issue until the tech industry can stop talking about death of humans as this issue and a challenge to be overcome and start recognising the fundamental value of life over getting from a to b with your hands off a wheel there will be opposition
949,well for one the horse and buggy fan boys said the same about engines second the comments here go way beyond just fsd its more about lets shit on everything musk third a lot of the comments are very ill informed for technology people
950,well for one the horse and buggy fan boys said the same about engines second the comments here go way beyond just fsd its more about lets shit on everything musk third a lot of the comments are very ill informed for technology people
951,predictable abuse combined with the sense that breaking a few eggs along the way is justified is very dangerous we know these systems are not level they still require the driver a lot and decades of research shows us that humans are terrible at waiting to do an activity and step in when needed this is being proven again with the level systems in production today techcrunchcommit study finds tesla drivers become inattentive when autopilot is activated unfortunately people like yourself have been misled about the capabilities of todays systems
952,would you rather be on the road with a properly licensed regulated responsible driver who is not just half assed tested once in his entire life back in the teen years and in a society where we dont pressure people into driving when tired and give people ample cheap public transportation and remove unfair stigmas against it so they can use alternate transportation when needed or let technology we dont even trust to run our dumb little phones correctly do something as important and mission critical as drive a car something that not only can potentially endanger the passenger but people in other cars and property around them regulation and change has to happen technology isnt the solution to everything since technology isnt perfect and can potentially be far more dangerous than a distracted driver our over reliance on technology has gotten us into a world full of anti privacy and anti freedom as well as so many other things that has dehumanized us to a point where we are essentially a slave to it technology has to be a tool not a means to an end we cannot allow automated driving to exist as it would cause so many more issues than it would solve as well as further erode privacy and freedom yes humans driving are problematic but solving that issue by doing common sense things to help our society eliminate a large number of these problems is a far better solution than further enslaving ourselves to repressive big brother technology im a lifelong sysadmin and programmer ask anyone like me and theyll say the same dont let technology run our lives its not anti technology its anti control and technology isnt reliable or secure enough in any situation to allow it bugs and hacks will happen and theres no way to safeguard it

954,exactly literally every other car company well lets put rivian and the other tech focused startups aside actually has to make their cars safe at risk of being sued into oblivion so why and how tesla is allowed to conduct glorified alpha testing on public roads is astounding to me i really hope they get reigned in and soon because what theyre doing right now is beyond irresponsible its likely going to cost lives before we know it
955,seriously i mean even excluding safety and just looking at build quality they have panel gaps because theyre still working out the kinks theyre a tech company working out how to make cars which is way harder than the other companies doing the opposite the panel gaps are still nowhere near acceptable for what you pay the door jambs arent painted because its a cost saving measure and for less waste if they can do it on a k polo they can afford to do it on your k model y or at least not make it look so shitty stop making excuses because you wanna ride elon more than your tesla
956,apparently risk taking and refusing to wait before making huge leaps is exactly what makes musk a super genius leader hes not lying about when self driving tech will be widely available to the public hes being hyper optimistic a characteristic without which his company would fail
957,theyre not wrong the easiest way to progress quickly is to move fast and break things thats fine when you accidentally break peoples access for a few hours to large scale knowledge database that has only existed for the last years or so thats not fine when the things you are breaking are users bones bodies and lives tesla takes the attitude of software design sometimes all that said tesla actually does a lot of heavy testing and checks the problem of being at the edge is that theres edge cases that only happen of the time and its really hard to fix remember when toyotas modification of accelerators and mats resulted in a huge amount of accidents to pay million in crash settlement mats still to blame it took over years since the issue was identified and toyota would still deny the obvious teslas engineering is top notch and their cars have had less security issues and better fixes than their competitors throughout the years blame the culture and management but the engineering is top notch human and sometimes making mistakes but as good quality as any other car maker as a matter of fact that will be the problem that self driving cars will have there will be errors and failures that will result in deaths but even if self driving cars do only slightly better than the average youd have to go to tens of thousands of deaths before it wouldnt still be a better idea than not doing it but people dont see it like that its the airplane fallacy someone would rather go drive cross country out of fear of dying on an airplane crash when in reality the moment they have the highest chance of dying on a flight is on the drive to and back from the airport a cross country trip is incredibly dangerous in comparison but because seeing someone die being run over or due to a car crash is an every day occurrence no one really talks about and we dont think but airplane crashes are so rare we obsess over them the safer car gets the more national news a car crash will be in this specific case though musk shot himself on the foot imho had he been less combative this wouldnt have escalated into an issue that is national news the tech is not at a point thats ready to ask for regulation revisits and offering more freedom on it while it may be mature enough that this would be beneficial we really dont have enough data even if tesla is doing it right its not easy to imagine what regulations must be set someone else could come with their cheap version that screws everyone and sets back the regulatory evolution of self driving cars a decade there is such a thing as too soon
958,yeah pretty much every reviewer has been saying tesla has as much time to learn to make a car as the other manufactures have to learn how to make an electric car because their tech is miles ahead but their process is well behind
959,theres joy in being an early adopter and eas are who help push a lot of tech forward that said self driving cars are not an area where this level of risk to others is an acceptable tradeoff for advancement and tesla has shown they cannot be trusted to deliver safe products without strict regulatory oversight
960,reason you have to pay attention is the self driving relies on a computer algorithm based on reinforcement learning the more data they can collect the better it will become but they have to collect that data somehow its like the idea of learning algebra if you came from an understanding of basic math learning algebra isnt too hard but if youre trying to jump from elementary school math straight into algebra youre going to be lost right now theyre trying to teach something that has never understood driving to drive so you can think of the people using the software as teachers and the more time they put into learning the better it can be but without them the right at which itll improve will be dramatically slower so in order for this sort of technology to take off and to be safe it requires a lot of training because how can it expect something like a pedestrian jumping into the road or an animal darting across or even another car swerving in front of you these are all very rare situations that may never happen to most people

962,autonomous cars will probably never be able to handle unpaved roads in north dakota winters or some such thats a ridiculously naive viewpoint though autonomous cars absolutely will be able to handle situations like that perfectly fine itll just take a bit longer for the tech to advance to that point
963,did you sign up for teslas beta test youre not listening just persistent in seeing this from one view this is about public safety first technological progress has always required breaking a few eggs if you want to make an omelet this is such a sociopathic statement those broken eggs are human beings do you know how many inhumane scientific experiments have been conducted with this inhumane justification even if we as a society decide to embark on this journey its not at teslas sole discretion

965,for one a lot of industries dont like change yes we make fewer horse whips but having legitimate fears about multiple explosions contained in a cage that has you and your family has some legitimacy musk brings lovers and haters like a lot of outspoken ceos look at gates we created a whole culture of us vs them with apple vs msft in the searly s lastly this forum has no bar for entry quality posting is on different tech subs with heavier moderation
966,i am under no impression that fsd is perfect or even good but the bar is pretty low for exceeding human capability lets do some quick math the fatality rate for human drivers is deaths per million miles traveled statisticsdetailstate by state tesla has about million cars with autopilot on the road cleantechnicacomover tesla vehicles with autopilot on the road the average driver drives miles per week cut our driving in half is it time for pay per mile insurance shbadaad so telsa drivers alone are collectively averaging million miles per week this means that even if the tesla autopilot got into a fatal accident once a week every single week that fatality rate would be more than twice as safe as human drivers i think you severely overestimate what it takes to be better than the average driver and just perceive a higher risk because its a loss of control not cause its actually riskier
967,thats an impressive false dichotomy statistically the safest place to be in america even safer than your own home is on an airplane being flown by an autopilot think about that for a second yes i would love to live in a society that prioritizes public transportation and doesnt hand out licenses like candy i hate to be the bearer of bad news but we dont live in that reality in the real world someone is on their th bender this week and is right now starting the ignition on a giant minivan and hoping they dont get pulled over right now somewhere the state is reluctant to take away an almost blind grandmas license because we havent prioritized public transit for decades and her family is gone so she is reliant on the car to get her groceries and medicine i also have worked in tech all my life youre right that its a giant house of cards and theres no way to safeguard it but is anything in life get your head out of the clouds man if we always waited for wed be extinct by now i want cars to be as safe as airplanes and that means taking all but the best humans out of the loop
968,i contributed my personal experience of ownership and satisfaction with a product and my excitement for the future of the technology all you are doing is looking for any excuse to shit on one of the most important technologies of our time did papa elon hurt you

970,actually i did sign up for the beta test every advancement comes at a cost we wouldnt have covid vaccines without learning from people who died of it we wouldnt have nuclear power without radiation killing people who discovered it im actually surprised that self driving technology has advanced as far as it has without more human cost but its a worthwhile cost as long as non sec driving cars continue to kill more people every day try to step back and consider the bigger picture here

972,sure could you do me a favor and name any other general public product or technology in all of human history that both has the ability to injure or kill people and was developed to perfection inside a facility such that no one was ever injuredkilled im interested in figuring out what you would consider a good example of what you want edit meant to direct this at op uwelivedintheocean

974,you cant separate your general outrage elon hate bias etc from the technology
975,you cant separate your general outrage elon hate bias etc from the technology
976,such that no one was ever injuredkilled probably very few incidents happen but that doesnt mean products like space heaters washing machines train engines and whatnot werent initially tested as much as possible inside a lab before deploying them on a large scale im not arguing vs having a couple of beta testers on the roads with safety glasses on here im arguing regular consumers shouldnt be enrolled in self driving software betas without being employed in some way by the company to do so and having done some specific safety training like if this was the new call of duty beta on the road want to test these cars hire some damn qa people to do so in simulations then in private roads and then on public roads and keep doing that until you dont consider that a beta at all at that point some incidents may yet happen and that is okay no tech is perfect
977,imagine for a moment youre a physics enthusiast imagine theres a physics related subreddit now imagine that theres a bunch of people usually without any education or knowledge of physics who post crazy perpetual motion machines or devices that theyre selling to the public of course that harvest dark matter as green energy or predict the jetsons tier hovercars without any actual science to back how it would work then when you complain about it someone says you hate physics andor elon musk or are just generally outraged whatever the fuck that means thats how ridiculous this all is except its technology which means everyone and their dog has their c to put in and to make ps i like elon musk so that stupid argument is even more bizarre to me

979,its cray i honestly dont know what im talking about with my masters in ai and years as a developer people who love technology know what they are doing we love tech and tesla is making tech happen so we dont give two shits about the outrage crowd
980,its cray i honestly dont know what im talking about with my masters in ai and years as a developer people who love technology know what they are doing we love tech and tesla is making tech happen so we dont give two shits about the outrage crowd
981,oh are we resorting to that now ok i guess youre a shill for big oil how many planes crashed before the first commercial flight how many injuries came from model ts from the first railways heck from the first printing presses is there any technology or product in existence that has the ability to injurekill and was developed without any injuries or deaths talk about living in fantasy

983,it was unveiled in you still cant buy it its still claiming magical battery technology that nobody else is close to achieving and nobody has been able to verify it but you can buy shares in the company because its yet another ev investment scam yay

985,i assumed this technology was still years away but there are several google self driving cars in my neighborhood in austin that drive around all day in dense areas with busy bike lanes and foot traffic and asshole cars and they seem to do just fine they ride around heb parking lot wait for people to cross and go when they should go half of people cant seem to figure that out it does well around busses too when the bus is over at a stop it will go around but if the bus turns off its flashers it will wait to let the bus back in and my favorite it wont right hook you when youre on a bike that concept is like chinese calculus to a lot of drivers here

987,aaaaaaaaaaaaa yea lets clamp down on this future tech before it improves anyones lives cant go changing things where will the all the candle makers go
988,self driving cars could be great as long as people maintain them properly i see so many cars out on the road now missing parts burning oil or with tires just about flat that i am concerned if someone cant maintain the low technology cars how can they be expected to maintain high technology cars im in favor of self driving cars but if the sensors are not kept clean and working the car could be driving blind

990,so a group of politicians who by and large dont understand the technology or the implications while influenced by lobbyists and donations are going to create the rules i expect this will go well
991,so a group of politicians who by and large dont understand the technology or the implications while influenced by lobbyists and donations are going to create the rules i expect this will go well
992,we mostly need the laws so they can sell the tech not because people will actually follow them speed limits exist too meanwhile everyones cruising over everywhere and keep in mind its still extremely early days for this stuff even though it is safer than humans its not and wont be people are still going to die in the hands of self driving cars just with any luck itll be tens per year and not tens of thousands
993,and that makes perfect sense for at least the first few years of actually implementing this technology
994,and that makes perfect sense for at least the first few years of actually implementing this technology
995,this isnt preventative regulation there were inevitably going to be rules about how to start introducing the technology it was never going to just be a free for all doing it now and at a federal level is a good thing and will only speed up the process
996,this isnt preventative regulation there were inevitably going to be rules about how to start introducing the technology it was never going to just be a free for all doing it now and at a federal level is a good thing and will only speed up the process
997,youre getting downvoted for saying this technology allows something that couldnt happen before when there are in fact a multitude of methods by which you can already be tracked self driving cars dont really introduce any new privacy threats
998,youre getting downvoted for saying this technology allows something that couldnt happen before when there are in fact a multitude of methods by which you can already be tracked self driving cars dont really introduce any new privacy threats
999,not so they can sell the tech so that the police can still go out and meet their ticket quota instead of having to serve or protect
1000,yeah it will be much easier to get people to accept the technology and allay some of the fears people have about self driving cars sure it means well have a generation of cars that will be old fashioned and rubbish but thats a sacrifice im willing to make if it prevents long term stalling of the technology being rolled out
1001,yeah it will be much easier to get people to accept the technology and allay some of the fears people have about self driving cars sure it means well have a generation of cars that will be old fashioned and rubbish but thats a sacrifice im willing to make if it prevents long term stalling of the technology being rolled out
1002,i know tesla and google are both pushing for this they trust their tech
1003,it will end high speed chases as well when police have the technology to just tell your car to pull itself over who is gonna try to rob a bank and then get away in an sdc a car whos license plate and vin can be accessed through wifi a car that wont break the speed limit a car that will probably tell the police where it is going where it came from and its entire history of locations

1005,many commercial trucks in the us are owner operated theyll buy the tech for themselves also the reduction in accidents will result in lower insurance premiums and fewer lawsuits fromagainst their drivers from there it will just be a math problem as to whether autopilot tech is purchased or not
1006,because governments arent infallible but more importantly security isnt guaranteed self driving vehicles are amazing technology but people tend to ignore the more complicated issues everyone just focuses on how it will make their lives more convenient but there will also be drawbacks and its a solution to a problem weve created urban sprawl and long daily commutes could be solved in other ways

1008,so basically everyone thinks this a great idea theres a reason why you need to wait till the technology is ready either everyone uses self driving cars or you dont use them at all for now
1009,so basically everyone thinks this a great idea theres a reason why you need to wait till the technology is ready either everyone uses self driving cars or you dont use them at all for now
1010,people arent really the problem honestly if you give people the ability to have a self driving uber show up at their door and drive them wherever they need to go whenever they need to go for a fraction of the cost of automotive ownership people will use it in droves the problem is all the industries people having that level of convenience and safety disrupts those industries auto manufacturing petrochemical insurance rely on every commuter needing or wanting their own personal vehicle they dont make enough money otherwise and if that means they keep driving over a million dead bodies most of whom are children a year to do it thats exactly what theyre going to keep doing and why they bribe governments to kill self driving technology

1012,in this context imperfect means not guaranteed to never crash self driving technology is already safe enough to be unlikely to crash and potentially already better than people
1013,in this context imperfect means not guaranteed to never crash self driving technology is already safe enough to be unlikely to crash and potentially already better than people
1014,we didnt evolve to be able to drive we evolved to handle that sort of input and real time analysis however you still seem to be arguing about the relative abilities of cars vs computers which im not talking about im pointing out that its difficult for a computer to drive a car thats why its cutting edge technology with a handful of companies even trying to make it happen you know what isnt difficult for a computer spreadsheets databases that stuff thats so easy foss programmers give it away for free its not at all easy for computers to drive cars and it wont be for many many years even if theyre already better at it than humans its not easy for them and its not easy to improve them if it was easy to improve them when they made a mistake we wouldnt teach them how to avoid the mistake by giving them hundreds of thousands of miles of driving wed say dont turn left in front of oncoming traffic or wed say a flashing left yellow arrow means you can turn if its safe it wouldnt take examples to teach them the difference between a real stop sign and a stop sign on a roadside billboard as part of an advertisement

1016,accident rates are mostly a red herring fully autonomous self driving will never happen without the us government putting up enough money on road infrastructure to effectively turn roads into railroads all the rhetoric about accident rates or precision is a way to enforce this completely false notion of technological inevitability so that car companies can appropriate more public subsidies for private gain its actually very similar to how the development of counterforce nuclear strategy and therefore nuclear armament escalation hinged on the supposed inevitability of missile precision improvements which would not have been developed without the political decision to develop the arsenal for counterforce in the first place

1018,obligatory rfuckcars ice cars are on their way out it is antiquated technology instead of addressing the significant problems caused by mass car adoption health public space injury to others microplastic pollution carbon emissions noise pollution etc there is a lot of pressure to just transition to self drive electric cars understand this is mostly to keep in the pockets of automotive companies insurance companies etc i like cars and outside of the city are often necessary because of the lack of public transport options but i recognise that companies like tesla and such keep trying to reinvent the bustramstrains but worse

1020,not in california it would seem no wonder testing of this technology and adoption of it is big out there
1021,not in california it would seem no wonder testing of this technology and adoption of it is big out there
1022,you make good points and this really highlights how far away from actual self driving cars we are elon musk has spent years selling us this idea when all theyve got is cruise control that can follow lanes and even if we had the technology for cars to drive themselves were still years from resolving the ethical issues
1023,you make good points and this really highlights how far away from actual self driving cars we are elon musk has spent years selling us this idea when all theyve got is cruise control that can follow lanes and even if we had the technology for cars to drive themselves were still years from resolving the ethical issues
1024,is that going to be legally the fault of the user or of the company which designed the car which handed over control while the user was pouring coffee this isnt what current semi autonomous vehicles are meant for as much as i think the tech is dangerous i cant really blame the manufacturer when people fail to follow what is legally required of them if the company goes out of business must any cars of that brand be taken off the road despite a good safety record i can see manufacturers being required to have insurance covering this or for all of them to pay into a single pot to cover it
1025,the technology could be used for buses and other public transport also but youre right the infrastructure just isnt there especially i the uk with our narrow roads
1026,the technology could be used for buses and other public transport also but youre right the infrastructure just isnt there especially i the uk with our narrow roads
1027,yeah sort of the cars have several ways of seeing what is around them but not all of the tech is perfect video below explains a few issues youtubeovehppvqsy
1028,understandable though as it will be a long long long time before the tech is fully matured
1029,i think that teslas are only level as that is all they are eligible fortheres probably not much difference in tech between the tesla and chinese cars just that when it is legal for self driving cars tesla will flick the switch and be level
1030,yes but with cruise control im focused hands on the wheel paying absolute attention its just a driver aid its not actually driving for me when the car starts speeding up slowing down steering turning changing lanes etc youre not actually in control of the car any more youre sat there twiddling your thumbs which begs the question of what is the point if you need to pay attention and also if i know people and i do because i am people then this means whoever is there is not going to be paying anywhere near as much attention as someone who is actually driving its not possible to be as focused on whole task that youre not actually performing yourself a passenger is not as focused as a driver when you take away the stimulation people are less focused and if the car then suddenly needs to hand control back because its a half finished self drive then the driver isnt going to be on the ball sorry but i stand by my point self drive without the driver or dont bother driving aids like cruise control are fine but self driving tech like this either needs to be all or nothing
1031,imo this technology will never reach the point where it is safer than human drivers i really cant understand why companies are pissing away so much money on something that is really not needed what is going to happen when the computer that makes the whole thing work crashes the sensors fail or some mud gets on the road and the vehicle in front of it kicks up the mud and it covers up the sensors and the autonomous vehicle cant see the car in front of it or the edge of the road i also want to see what happens when one of these self driving cars meets a farmer driving a huge tractor or a combine on a narrow country road is the computer going to be able to pull the car off onto the shoulder to let the machine pass or is it going to get squished under the huge tires like the junkers at a monster truck rally i get so fed up with new technology sometimes that i am really tempted to just go join the amish they live pretty much the same way my grandparents did until the end of wwii and there is a lot to be said for that lifestyle my grandparents got their first car circa but didnt have electricity in their farmhouse until and my grandad farmed with horses until only two decades before i was born

1033,one of the big problems is all this damn technology they are putting in new cars people are too distracted by their in vehicle infotainment system and too busy fiddling with the touch screen on the dash to pay attention to the damn road i dont care if you have bluetooth and it is hands free if you are talking on the phone while driving you are distracted our roads would be far safer if all of this new technology were banned by the ntsb and automakers were forced to go back to making cars like they were years ago with simple easy to use knobs and buttons

1035,the good news for the industry is that it has time stevens estimates that by there will be only million autonomous vehicles on american roadsless than percent of todays total and as of now the technology required for autonomous features is extremely expensive to repair meaning premiums will initially rise as more cars featuring them roll off dealers lots this is the lie they tell themselves and their investors million autonomous vehicles in fleets could handle the transit needs for about million people this is pretty close to the total population of the us the article doesnt even entertain the idea that maybe sdc fleets are the future and not individually owned cars this is probably because the insurance contacts steered away from this being a possibility at all they realize that if this does happen there really is no insurance industry as we know it today left the rest of the article is basically an argument for why you wont own an sdc unless you are rich and really want to as automation reaches levels and fully autonomous capability with the option for a human driver to take over and fully autonomous with no human involvement respectivelyinsurance is going to change dramatically it wouldnt be an article without the reporter messing up the sae levels i dont blame the reporting sae leaves are useless for talking about avs not since we came up with the rules for what is a fruit or a vegetable did humans create a more useless and confusing taxonomy

1038,those cars pose a risk to the fabric of society not conceived of in modern times the insurance companies are not going anywhere a bunch of monopolistic hopefuls these orwellian companies that work on this tech represent these cars on a highway at high speeds represents an unfathomable level of damage that could be done why is this tech not sold as human augmentation as to help drivers do their job better or not dui its sold as a complete replacement theres no middle level where humans have this tech available to increase performance that shows the intent of these evil companies they want monopolies and to control transport just like the taxi companies did just in a new package that has a technological moat around it that whole industry is a metastasizing virtual tumor for the future to deal with

1040,all technology fails at some point right what happens if someones snoozing in a self driving car its sensors fail and the human doesnt wake up to manually takeover still the cars fault id say but this is unpreventable
1041,all technology fails at some point right what happens if someones snoozing in a self driving car its sensors fail and the human doesnt wake up to manually takeover still the cars fault id say but this is unpreventable
1042,i really dont see that its a meaningful difference lets be honest the end customer is paying for it one way or the other the only difference is whether you write the check when you buy the car or you write the check every month its a technicality people spend way too much time worrying about its no different than if you have a limo and a personal driver today youre paying the insurance somebodysomething else is in control the only difference is in the case of a self driving car youre paying way way less for both the driver and the insurance
1043,they will certainly change car mechanics in some way not that every new car technology hasnt but this one more drastically than average
1044,they will certainly change car mechanics in some way not that every new car technology hasnt but this one more drastically than average
1045,yeah i get that the person at fault is ultimately the one responsible but just consider a case today if the brakes fail on your car the car hits someone the manufacturer is technically responsible and ultimately liable but its not that simple is it theyre not going to come to your defence youll get in a lot of bother in the mean time and it may be that no one even believes you the manufacturer might try to deny any wrongdoing and weasel their way out of admitting a fault in the brakes this is actually very common with automobile faults its a nightmare to get them to admit a fault cos it usually means an expensive recall too now if they are accepting liability from the get go even if someone can still sue you the point is that they would be wasting their time and most likely wouldnt even bother cos they know volvo will be the end result of that anyway and with volvo already contractually obliged to be liable youll find way less hassle for yourself too as they deal with it even if the legal situation doesnt change i think the manufacturer taking it on in this way would make a huge difference to the actual process in the real world
1046,well i guess we wont have to wait long for the first accident to happen at last an opportunity for me to not dislike tesla having such good press a bad reaction from the media might damage self driving tech adoption by legislators
1047,the trolley problem analogy is also dumb for a more fundamental technical reason which is that the neural nets used to train these driving models dont follow hard coded sets of if then statements there literally is no place in the model to write if baby_in_stroller_death_probabilty then swerve_off_cliffexe
1048,surely the catch all solution would be to stay in your lane and brake depending on how fast youre going this could hurt the passenger although i agree that its probably easiest to control the safety inside of the car and make external decisions based on what improves safety outside the car why would there be time to swerve if there isnt time to brake because you keep going forward even when you brake even if you were to immediately crush the wheel by pressing relentlessly hard on it the wheels arent attached to the road so its still going to skid the idea of swerving is to redirect that momentum at a safer target that said some of these trolley problems are kind of contrived city and town roads are rated for their safest possible speed so its on par with your hair dryer burning your house down yeah technically both can happen but its so rare that we dont really plan society around it youd only run into trolley problem stuff going highway speeds but those are typically inaccessible to pedestrians and graded to maximize visibility the more likely dilemma is probably is it better to swerve into this other car right now drive off the highway or let this other car hit me which would likely send me into this other car anyways the answer is probably deploy airbags and drive off highway but i actually dont know that one but thats a little harder to visualize so people go with the pedestrian example
1049,sure the tech is there and easy enough a person and a car look very different but look at how isps handle controversial content they could easily create blocklists for all of the kiddie porn sites they know about out there they dont why because it creates liability issues for them then they have to explain in court why some sites are blocked but not others the easiest path for them is to do no blocking at all
1050,buffett says that one problem self driving cars would have would be determining what to do if a child jumps out in front of the car and another car is heading in the opposite direction do you hit the child or do you hit the other car the first problem i have with that analysis is why do people assume that a human would make a better choice in that situation second the answer is simple you hit the child the child is at fault so there is no reason to endanger either yourself or the people in the other car that you would hit the entire accident would be recorded the child would be declared at fault and no lawsuit would be filed the issue here is that people dont like having to think about making difficult decisions they want to pretend that such things wont happen and when they do they want to have the sudden immediacy of it absolve away the guilt coldly planning out which is the best of bad choices ahead of time is not something people want or like to do however our discomfort is a problem with us not the technology

1054,vtadvfcjcm just to return to this there is a lot mitigating head on collisions nowadays its called fucking engineering in no world is it acceptable to run over a fucking child because insurance we have technology that protects people in impacts if we must have an impact we do it with the least worst option in mind

1056,why does it need to identify that its a person in the google video pedestrians and cyclist are automatically identified in a consumer sdc that will presumably happen at a very low level maybe even silicon for example googles project tango tctechcrunchfileswordpresscomcameras_tangopng wh has x on board computer vision processors that do the heavy lifting and number crunching that data is then exposed to the higher levels my point and the ethical situation is that the ai will probably already know whats in the swerve area since it will probably be identified at a low level a programmer may end up intentionally or unintentionally ignoring what is known to the car
1057,well no its a matter of the law if you swerve into oncoming traffic and cause an accident then you are at fault you have not countered that very simple point you are the only one here offering up nothing but an opinion hey have you at least changed your opinion that head on collisions can be successful mitigated through tech considering that was your main point its very telling that your latest argument totally avoids mentioning it and now relies entirely on pleading moral superiority
1058,alphabetgooglewaymo has the vast majority of the self driving patents but to this day google has never charged a penny for the use of any of their ip not a single penny they get patents so nobody else does but not to use them as a weapon that is more microsoft mo so for example ms gets paid over for every android phone sold with patent royalties versus it is google ip and they do not charge a cent why microsoft makes to from every android device sold now with that said there is only one time that googlewaymo has even tried to protect ip and that was the suit with uber over the theft of trade secrets and believe patent infringement or something similar was involved plus google shared almost all their ip through papers and software so things like mapreduce gfs bigtable borgomega with kubernettes and much of what runs everyones cloud came from google with ip they just patented and then gave away and never charged a cent for same with backrub and later renamed pagerank but that patents is technically owned by stanford but anyone can use and why we have other search engines but we can see waymo has not yet given away any ip i mean none i monitor papers out of google closely as they usually become the standard way to do things in the tech world and nothing from waymo it is possible google will approach ip differently with waymo so far they have ot it could be that googlewaymo will share once they win the market that is also how google often times does things they only shared the tpu paper after they released the tpu version
1059,tldr google stock is probably still undervalued this isnt a new tech product this is going to be a fundamental piece of the st century transport infrastructure and google is going to own it outright this is like railroads in the s this is a hundred year business even the self driving hype men are underselling this and theyre vastly underestimating how quickly it will happen
1060,thats why its an infrastructure play this land grab favors not just technology but execution having multiple traveling advanced mapping teams is a tough management problem its expensive resource intensive think all the business support staff you need for these teams all the software you need to manage their tasks and use them effectively the training program youll need to get them ready to do the mapping that being said it sounds like a great job for recent college grads you live in a new city for months then move on with all your recent college grad friends waymo has already mapped a bunch of cities where they test so expect the next launches in those cities

1063,google has been interested in doing self driving cars for over a couple of decades since day they have done stuff to help them position for the day page has indicated it started with an experience he had at university in michigan or minnesota one of those cold states that starts with an m the other aspect that is critical with maps and waze is that it brings real time data from humans that can be used and even trained from to a certain extent so if all the humans are stopping somewhere and visually it does not make sense for the waymo car you probably should be stopping and definitely being careful but google can see stops signs that humans blow through they get accidents in real time to avoid that is with waze they get real time traffic events or a parade or a protest basically they have many millions of phones giving them the data of humans moving around in real time but they are the only ones with this data but it is not just the data but the infrastructure being able to stream events from so many phones at the same time and able to make sense and run against models and then use to update is actually really hard to do google has been doing it for over a decade and already knows how and has the technology to leverage gm or ford or whoever struggles to create a decent infotainment system ultimately this data is about safety that is why you see waymo having gone over million miles with a single accident their fault which was a fender bender and nobody hurt it is why i just cant see a gm self driving car ever being as safe as a waymo car we can see that gm is having accidents at a much higher rate and gone a tiny number of miles compared to google the motor cyclist that gm hit did live but think it is just a matter of time until they kill someone think gm has gone k miles and waymo over million but then waymo has done over a billion virtually which is critical to have you must do automated testing and situational injection which i do not believe any of the others can do this will be critical for safety

1065,really people with a team of have cars driving around without safety drivers if this was true would you get into one of these cars self driving technology is one of the most difficult things humans will solve from a technology standpoint it is so complicated on one hand and then it is literally a matter of life and death on the other that is pretty unique combination it is true launching a space ship into space is life or death but those people signed up for it i am talking innoncent people that did not agree to use sdc could die heck with uber we already had that exact situation with the tesla deaths as far as i am aware it was the tesla owner and not an innocent bystander

1067,waymo employees are not given alphabet shares but are given shares in waymo so would expect waymo to be spun out within a couple of years when that happens alphabet will keep the float pretty small and because of supply and demand the value of waymo will be inflated plus it should be rewarded with sdc hype which is not priced into googgoogl today now how much help googgoogl well last quarter google put up growth and has a forward pe of about so a peg of about using forward pe so would say googgoogl is already significantly undervalued the answer is nobody knows i am old an quit trying to predict how such things will play out in share price instead i look at things that will have strong growth and have faith everything else will work out i believe sdc is a trillion dollar a year opportunity and will take decades to get there so it is about as ideal as you can get for something to fuel growth for a very long time google has now had over growth for the last quarters they will need fuel in a couple of years to keep that going look out years from now when they have b of revenue they will need b of revenue growth so i look at hardware cloud and waymo to get them over b of that then the other b to come from youtube and ads i also believe sdc will be winner take all like other tech things
1068,we can see disengagement rate we can see how many miles but was just reading today gm had one of their cars crash into another of their cars waymo only has one accident their fault in over million miles there is no shortcuts on how being done gm is several years behind but also has a disadvantage more broadly to compete i suspect gm is actually many more years behind then what they suggest how this is being done by everyone is very manual number of miles matter and variety of the miles waymo has tested all over the us think it is now different states and over different cities on cruise crash hardest thing self driving a cruise on cruise crash reveals the hardest thing about self driving tech edit my bad it is six states that waymo has tested but short changed them in cities tested in over cities that is physical world and more virtually waymo has also gone more than a billion miles in virtual world gm does not have infrastructure like google to do virtual world
1069,yeah it is difficult the numbers i gave were more of examples than their precise level of progress i was just trying to give an example of why a ish person team might seem like they have the technology but that waymo is actually leagues ahead of them they are beginning to work on snow and ice but there are so many markets in the us alone that wouldnt need snowice so it makes sense for them to focus on locations where that isnt required first freeways are actually the easiest places to do autonomy city streets have pedestrians bikers crosswalks and are generally much more interesting

1071,makes sense i also forgot that those caps arent really reliable because of all the rules around how contractors need to be treated differently than employees oh well hopefully waymo is really far along with their driverless tech and ill get to use the service soon by the way it just dawned on me that as a germaphobe if everything turns into ride share i may spend much more of my day uncomfortable
1072,guess because i am weird ha never had anyone say that before cruise went k miles in they do not have virtual world so zero virtual it is not about sucking anyones dick as you say it is just what the facts are how both waymo and gm and everyone but tesla is doing this it is a very manual development and miles driven has a linear relationship to where you are at in development obviously variety also plays a roll waymo far more variety and far more miles and so far ahead it is not complicated i am only talking the self driving tech aspect gm is way way more behind when you include all the other things needed for a commercial robot taxi service they do not have the digital infrastructure to support they do not have the human driving data which means cant make safe google knows what intersections people blow through with their google maps data and waze so can be more careful and avoid an accident where gm does not have that data just one example also why you see gm cars crash so much even with going so few miles
1073,nearly million people die in road crashes each year on average deaths a day an additional million are injured or disabled road crashes cost usd billion globally costing individual countries from of their annual gdp deaths a day ok it will take time to spread globally but what a game changer add to this electric cars and we need both of these technologies sooner rather than later
1074,as a parent of a and year old i would love this tech to keep my kids safe
1075,while my comment about the time its going to take for introduction is valid your statistics are no less valid and the statistics are interesting one day of delay of widespread introduction of crashless cars whether that day be lost to wrong choices in technology lack of funding bureaucratic wrangling legal debate or whatever it might be years off but it is still a day lost and so lives lost looked at another way there is a financial cost to delays above and beyond the cost in lives the biggest one is the financial cost associated with those lives note this does not imply the former equals the latter but is just one shadow cast by it the dot puts the value of avoiding a fatality at million in the us enwikipediaorgwikivalue_of_lifeunited_states there are about people killed per day that means the cost of delaying is on the order of b per day in the us alone your global number sounds low now but my methods are rough the implication is that investing up to b to get those cars out one day earlier is worthwhile to society for just the us its a big deal when a company drops even b into this research but we should really be dropping hundreds of billions into it just to avoid deaths and without other financial justification

1077,when in years yes a law banning standard cars would weigh heavily on those without money if someone cant afford the new tech and you take away their ability to get to their job you havent increased their health or probability of long term survival in years maybe not but i would expect insurance companies will have taken care of the issue long before then as they dont really care about long term survival unless they are the ones insuring it
1078,ummm lots of people dont like to ride around in other peoples filth if they dont have to lots of people dont want to wait the time it might take to have a cab dispatched especially during peak periods parking costs its not like my driveway is going to disappear anytime soon and most americans dont live in high density urban areas most of the arguments made for self driving cars are also arguments for much stronger public transportation networks in urban cities and intercity rail networks for connecting those cities all technology that is quite well proven not controversial incredibly safe and relatively inexpensive the self driving advocates are starting to push the shared ownership model because it is becoming increasingly apparent that self driving cars will not be deliverable at unit costs of less than figures theyre trying to in any way possible rationalize the high cost of a self driving vehicle to support further public equity market funding of self driving car research in the context of the lack of an otherwise viable business case btw maintenance costs on a car are largely a function of miles driven and are almost certainly to be dramatically greater for self driving cars due to the extra required redundancy safety systems and the life critical nature of their components insurance costs are highly correlated to miles driven long term interest rates are low so there is little downside to low capital intensity and cars are cheaper than ever those worried about capital intensity can simply buy cheaper cars what about all the extra fuel that a taxi cab fleet takes to move from user to user ever consider that will higher capital utilization intensity of a very expensive asset a sdc with high operating costs be better than a cheap asset a human driven car used very unintensively

1080,i think it entirely depends on the numbers that actually materialize anywhere in town theyll haul your stuff from home depot or the grocery store and wait while you unload and you might be right few need their own car if its like car rentals at airports and the taxes and fees literally exceed the cost of renting the car making it utterly economically infeasible to rent ran into this a couple weeks ago it was weird and no one will be interested many things are promised to be lower cost higher tech alternatives the number that prove out to be so are far fewer in number i could easily put together models where sdcs cost more less or the same as other options just by between reasonable assumptions
1081,the rear driver is technically at fault yes but if google is crashing at a higher than expected rate regardless of fault a lot of people would be interested in knowing why this is happening google has yet to provide convincing evidence that their overall crash regardless of fault rate is the same or better than the general publics despite their repeated claims otherwise
1082,this is brilliant what wonderful technology i meanit would be better if we invested in nation green mass transit but this is still pretty cool one thing with degree visibility and attention out in all directions at all times our newest sensors can keep track of other vehicles cyclists and pedestrians out to a distance of nearly two football fields you dont need a semicolon there semicolons separate two independent but related clauses the portion of the sentence before the semicolon is not independent

1085,im not comfortable with such nascent technology attempting absolutist moral reasoning youre asking for a possibility that the car may erroneously detect a person on a bridge and drive off the side who on earth wants to step into a vehicle knowing that its idiot pilot will sacrifice all passengers to avoid harming any single pedestrian

1089,the minute these cars are only twice as dangerous as human cars id be legalizing them and allowing them to sell to the public saving millions of man hours of drivers time and freeing it up to work or play is worth that alone some vehicles on the road today are already half as safe as others so it isnt really any worse than allowing a few more trucks with shoddy brakes on the road as soon as they start exceeding human safety records id be looking into making the technology compulsory in new cars to save lives just like seatbelts crumple zones and airbags are compulsory today

1091,i feel like quietly is unnecessary in the headline what do other redditors think casual passer by i have not read the article edit having read the article i think its important for google to publish transparency reports at this time im a robotics engineer in silicon valley and i understand that self driving cars are a technology that can work but i also feel like its a matter of public safety that we know who is testing self driving vehicles on the road and what happens with them google has business interests here but we also have public safety to consider im not worried about public safety with google but i am worried about the newly funded start up that thinks they can be secretive even when their tech is experimental ive heard rumors of self driving car start ups that test highly experimental software on public roads google can set an example here if they choose

1095,i wouldnt put much faith in the voxel map first the fact that its being built entirely from fairly low resolution images alone means its accuracy is at least moderately suspect from the beginning again great tech demoits impressive they can even do that much but its not enough when lives are at stake every demo ive seen including greens bears a pretty tenuous connection to the cars actual surroundings i might trust it to keep me away from curbs and other cars but certainly not to avoid a shards of broken glass for instance both the accuracy and spatial resolution are way too low second it doesnt change the ontological problem herethe system simply needs far more contextual understanding and common sense knowledge than it likely has to make intelligent inferences from what it sees whether its pixels voxels or both the system may know a flickering cluster of giant cubes is feet ahead of my bumper but what exactly does that mean is it safe or not this is a question about facts of the worldphysics materials causality etcnot mere geometry third even building a genuinely accurate voxel map would require more ontological awareness than the system appears to have in other words the process is circular just as it is in the human visual cortex we use depth cues to recognize the objects in front of us then use our understanding of those objects to refine and disambiguate those depth cues and repeat the process until we achieve a stable view of our surroundings the process doesnt just go in one direction so feeding in a rough pass of voxel estimation is only a first step many iterative steps remain hence i remain concerned teslas live in a dangerously cartoonish version of reality
1096,remote operation would require a safety critical zero latency high bandwidth connection given the issues that the connected vehicle piece is having with dsrc then i dont think we will see such a capability for at least another decade if then insuring such remote operations would be a major issue surely much more efficient to just have some roving technicians a bit like the automobile association tow trucks that can turn up and resolve issues on the spot
1097,i wonder if japanese automotive was pushing this if japanese automakers are getting in the market sdcs are pretty much guaranteed to happen companies like toyota are pretty conservative about adopting new technologies going from driven cars to sdc is huge leap bigger than going from gas to electric
1098,toyota is the least conservative among the japanese ones toyota is also pretty bold by investing heavily in sw recently almost like a transition to a tech company from what i see working for some of them japanese oems are not only more conservative but also take a bit different approach some of them rather see it as a safety feature also a japanese company would never release a half done solution like some of the us ones some of them have pretty good tech but also aware of the limitations and know it very well that full self driving is still very far on the other hand the smaller ones fall more and more behind because they dont have enough money to burn on massive rd projects
1099,germanys decisive push to clear autonomous car regulations could give the country an advantage in the race to become the global leader in developing the technology oh that looks promising lets continue reading germany is rewriting its traffic laws to include autonomous cars among the primary rules in its draft legislation is that these cars will still require a steering wheel and that a human must still sit behind it mmm no thats definitely not how you become the leader in self driving technology

1101,well ive got no problem with that its a safety precaution and when a technology is as new and untested in the real world as a two tonne machine rolling past the public at up to mph without a human in charge it does a lot for the publics state of mind to require a human behind a steering wheel and presumably a foot hovering over the brake pedal too

1103,i agree with you but the bright side is that if they are really willing to adapt the law to new technologies they may adapt it again when being behind the wheel is no longer necessary
1104,how about instead of simply requiring steering wheels and humans behind them we start thinking about legislation on how to safely remove them that would be acting like a leader in self driving technology and not just as a follower if we wait until the technology is ready then comes the question how do we know its actually ready what tests do we need what proof is convincing shouldnt we start trying to answer those questions before the technology is ready to avoid any unnecessary delay after all human driving kills people there is no lack of incentive in shortening the deployment of full autonomy

1106,if we wait until the technology is ready then comes the question how do we know its actually ready what tests do we need what proof is convincing the tech is ready when the public has trust in it that would be acting like a leader in self driving technology and not just as a follower that would be useless actionism and symbolic politics without any merit requiring a driver and a steering wheel does not hold back the industry during research it does not matter needing a back up and when the tech is ready for mass deployment in the general public then you can drop the requirements

1108,the tech is ready when the public has trust in it so blind people should wait until the rest of the population that doesnt need self driving cars as much as them has trust in the technology we need empirical proof for the technology to be deployed not a popularity contest

1112,technology breakthroughs always precede mass adoption by several years every mass produced technology starts as a niche product telephones tv sets computers etc

1114,not really look at tablet or smartphones for example this is the only the way if the product is completely new if it is an improvement of existing tech aka cars then this is not the case
1115,youre right uber is at fault that doesnt mean sdc tech should be at fault this uber did not have technology that is safe for driving on its own on public roads it had incomplete unfinished technology and uber knows this therefore uber did not and has not deployed this technology thats why they were testing it so they can make it better this accident is due to human error and perhaps poor company practices

1117,arstechnicacomcarsvideo suggests huge problems with ubers driverless car program
1118,there will always be accidents we cant say a system should never be allowed to make mistakes tesla had a fatality simply because the system could not distinguish a semi truck trailer from the sky at an angle tesla corrected that and moved on there will always be something in the software that needs to be corrected as to why uber isnt accepting responsibility thats because our entire culture is litigious and should they admit fault they open themselves up to crippling lawsuits that could potentially end their autonomous taxi service which since they have actually done nothing worse than any other new technology including their peers would be excessive we really cannot expect every brand new technology to have a perfect fatality free rate and punish every company that fails that by suing them into oblivion but that us the way our current legal and media system works it could even destroy their company so they cant admit fault personally i feel that uber is extending a little far but thats what business does if you arent on the cutting edge then you are being shut out so i at least understand even if i dont agree

1120,a technology operating at this level can simply be not be allowed to have failures this is not true sdcs can have lots of failures as long as they are safer on average than humans they are still worth using
1121,a technology operating at this level can simply be not be allowed to have failures this is not true sdcs can have lots of failures as long as they are safer on average than humans they are still worth using
1122,even if the self driving tech failed and the self driving tech is garbage this accidentdeath is still due to human error a self driving system was not responsible for avoiding hitting pedestrians a human was responsible for avoiding hitting pedestrians and they failed to do so this is only more evidence we need to speed up self driving cars one can make an argument that testing an av system still in development with a human responsible for the vehicle is more dangerous than a regular human driven vehicle however data shows the opposite the accident per mile rate of testing avs is a tiny fraction of the human accident per mile rate and even more so when you consider the majority of av testing is in more complex urban environments more complexity less miles
1123,i dont think your point of uber going into oblivion seems correct air accidents were common one day eg enmwikipediaorgwikiair_inter_flight_ but that didnt cause airbus to shut down we are today at a point where we dont have a regulatory body governing safety of self driving cars the creators of the technology should take responsibility rather than trying to get the matter to be forgotten

1125,i like to think about the positions involved in this scenario a woman lost her life for jaywalking vs uber killing a person because the company was not ready with the technology possibly uber would get away with a slap on the wrist while the woman is no longer alive do you believe that the positions punish both parties equally

1127,yeah i dont know maybe it wouldnt make a difference but replacing the built in software does seem like it would be a big change if you tried to bring something to court if the oems software screws up they can argue that the driver should have been paying attention but the actual glitch is on one entity if you replace the original software pinning the issue on the software company vs the car manufacturer seems a lot more complicated teslas self driving stuff has only been around since and there are a lot of open cases against them about autopilot enabled accidents it seems premature to say that car manufactures never ever under any circumstances have any liability whatsoever for a malfunctioning ads when were only years in to the technology being introduced
