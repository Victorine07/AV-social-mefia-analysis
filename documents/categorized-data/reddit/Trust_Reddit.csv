0,my concern is cost even if ai gets perfected to the point that autonomous driving is demonstrably safer than humans tomorrow how much would that feature add to the cost of a car how long before you can get an old beater with ai will it even be something you can merely buy once or will it end up as so many things are as a costly subscription as much as id love a self driving car and as much as it would make the roads safer if everybody had one there are lots of people who will never be able to afford a new dumb car let alone a smart one the requisite hardware for autonomous driving would not only have to be good and reliable and safe it would also have to get cheap enough that it doesnt price entry level buyers out of the new car market and will have to be around long enough that there are plenty of old cheap autonomous cars available for those who cant afford new at a guess id say youd need to wait about years after autonomous cars became mainstream before even thinking about legislation even then youd have to start with merely requiring the feature for new model years like we did for backup cameras a few years ago maybe another decade after that you could start financially disincentivizing human driven cars insurance surcharges and whatnot in the end i dont think youll ever need to ban them theyll just become too old and too expensive for any but hardcore enthusiasts to bother keeping years after ai driving becomes a standard feature cars without the feature will be years old think about cars that are years old now would you want to drive one every day theyre so old that theyre either rusting into the ground or have gone through the old and cheap phase and come out the other side into the realm of expensive classics sooner or later cars without ai will be like cars without fuel injection or abs or air conditioning theyll exist but theyll all have historic plates and theyll only get driven to car shows
1,no absolutely not there are too many systems built on systems that can fail due to things mundane eg weather to things rare eg earthquakes floods etc for me to ever trust an autonomous vehicle
2,no if there was actual reliable public transportation throughout the country id consider it until then no fucking way
3,yeah this is why im ultimately against it a ban would hurt the low income people today its not super rare to see vehicles from the early s and the s either because the driver is frugal or just too poor to upgrade in or whenever we have autonomous vehicles there will undoubtedly be many in the same position driving and cars and banning all non autonomous vehicles is effectively crippling these peoples ability to travel if we have reliable and affordable mass public transit everywhere then sure maybe but i doubt that will be the case
4,i dont think it would be acceptable to ban one form of transport for safety reasons for another that was not safe in addition if its between someone being able to get around or not because they dont trust the technology then they should be able to drive themselves comfort has always outweighed lives saved approximately million people are killed in fatal crashes each year on average thats about deaths a day globally an additional million are injured or accident statistics no one has banned cars yet
5,thats a fair point to raise but its still an arbitrary point to place a line in the sand it has less to do with legal freedom but most people already have no freedom mentally or physically to cross the sea most have to rely upon technology or professionals to make that trip why draw the line there on how farwhere you can travel without the reliance on others the easiest place to draw the line truly is with walkingbiking if you have the need to travel great distances thats going to require some level of sacrifice no matter how you look at it also more specifically addressing your concern we already do not have the liberty to use any old vehicle on public roads in many places it has to meet certain standards and its tested periodically according to those standards emissions safety etc a transition to autonomous is just one additional rung up the ladder you might not be okay with that but to me its very arbitrary and i disagree that its a concern for the losses that well experience we will gain just as many benefits with a transition to autonomous
6,in addition if its between someone being able to get around or not because they dont trust the technology then they should be able to drive themselves what if i dont trust you to drive yourself can i be able to have the technology drive you instead comfort has always outweighed lives saved approximately million people are killed in fatal crashes each year on average thats about deaths a day globally an additional million are injured or disabled no one has banned cars yet yeah thats objectively bonkers excuse me for not wanting to sacrifice myself so you can operate your cool toy
7,we dont because its too burdensome to subject people to that level of liability just so they can get around but if we had reliable autonomous driving tech people who choose not to use are volunteering for that liability
8,non autonomous cars arent but its easier to designate responsibility if something wrong happens disagree its distressingly hard to hold reckless drivers to account and even harder to exact meaningful damages from them car free future doesnt require knocking anything down just repurposing imo most of the us isnt built at a density that can support reliance on public transit
9,i dont think the replies are in favor of driving but more the freedom to have the option i personally would never drive again if this was a real option i hate driving but not as much as i hate police states and governmental over reach throwing axes in the middle of the street is just not an honest comparison ive driven my entire life and never killed a single person most people have in fact but if i started throwing axes in public id probably injure or kill someone in less than a week good drivers who honestly enjoy driving or perhaps just dont trust automation shouldnt be punished for other peoples mistakes just like we dont ban driving on holidays because its the time when the most drunk drivers are out we punish the individuals responsible not the entire society
10,those types of techniques can certainly reduce the incidence of false positives but in situations with enough vehicles and specular reflective surfaces your system can easily have very low confidence i used to work with vector templating system that can auto align using lasers and retro reflective material and even with all the tricks we lock out the ability to align two heads at the same time that are too close together these types of visual systems are very sensitive to interference i mean i worked on systems that needed thou accuracy on stationery mounts but i can certainly see a half dozen lidar scanners in very close proximity causing enough interference to atleast lower the confidence enough to make them significantly less reliable not to mention due to the fact that if a company wanted to use visible light lasers for improved range eyesafe and r systems are still incredibly distance limited for dynamically mounted sensors generally use at least other machine vision technology is needed to have adequate active track most of the vehicles that i have seen equipped with lidar systems are also using or other additional methods like machine vision with cameras and actual radar there is a reason we dont see automotive lidar on vehicles outside of experimental self driving applications and close to the ground warehouse autos controlled by a single server or coordinated through a hivemind iot architecture that is also supported by a server teslas decision to forgo lidar altogether didnt happen by accident its far easier to coordinate disparate devices when the scanners you are using arent emitters
11,you bring up good points i actually work on lidar for vehicles in my current position and so far i dont know of any oems that plan to rely on only one sensor type for the autonomous driving systems besides tesla using vision only lidar has its place in the sensor suite but a lot of the hard work happens at the sensor fusion level and the ai built into the computers taking all the sensor data in and processing it those systems can identify when they are in a situation where the lidar is not the most reliable sensor to take data in and adjust accordingly in the short term lidar is an improvement in safety for collision detection and automatic breaking systems to avoid the collision vs the existing sensors so it helps to enable the intermediate autonomous driving levels before getting to fully autonomous operation
12,cars shouldnt trust information given by stranger vehicles for the same reason your computer shouldnt trust executable code given stranger by machines
13,tesla rolled out a fully automatic prototype i believe heard it on rt podcast but assuming the waves used for this echolocation are easily recreatable a homemade device could just be emitting random signals you probably wouldnt be able to easily lock a car signal so the interference would be intermittent that said on a short enough list of frequencies it can cycle quick enough to block out say of what the car can read that means at a stoplight maybe a quarter of those cars get effected and will be recycling frequency if the blocker keeps cycling the only real limit is keeping the signal on long enough to tell the car they cant use it i assume itll ignore a few milliseconds of interference and the odds of collision are also very slim especially since it is required they have manual controls in most cases the mesh network system that will link all cars location can also probably be jammed not cheaply i assume but might make my whole idea moot for all i know i dont know how they plan to pull that off but if its not a satellite link and just lan you can probably mess with that channel too same device several signals now realistically a cheap build you could still probably get several frequencies covered at once that wont be directionally broadcasted without a wide array of points and geometry and even so if you had it in a car or something the likelihood of being mathematically pinpointed as the source is slim and i doubt a detective would find you prosecutable before manufacturers find a workaround you can download to these fancy whips if a manhole was open and letting out hot air nearby pressure changes could change who could be the culprit hacking would require a connection that the car trusts i believe they built the dlc interface to not really do anything except check teslacom for news and updates its pretty locked down and requires approval from the driver forcing a connection installation and hardware control while driving doesnt seem practical finally i know this isnt perfect not really fleshed out im pretty certain this wont actually happen someone with a six figure salary is in charge of that but it is scary to think that a driverless car will allow someone totally asleep to be driving along unable to react if the machine is compromised
14,oh right i forgot about forward and autopark cams whole idea shot the sleeping hypothetical was more about our dependence and trust in this as soon as its available i think id feel way more secure on a plane with a pilot doesnt matter that i trust a computer more a person has self preservation and the ability to monitor a machine i dont know many machines that id trust to monitor themselves
15,i am somewhere in between i use technology a lot but i have limited what kinds of data technology will have access to i dont discuss politics on social media or share deeply personal things on it i do use fb to follow what friends are up to and to share things id feel comfortable sharing with large groups i use twitter li solely for media consumption or professional posts i use the incognito mode when i am worried about confidentiality i do have alexa but wont use it in my bedroom i experimented with creating a smart home connected tv bulbs thermostats etc but concluded that the benefits werent worth it for me i no longer use it i am not saying any of these are right for you or anyone else but my overall take is that we cant live as tech luddites we should embrace technological progress but we should understand how they work and what can go wrong and we should draw a line somewhere that line might be at different places for different people but we shouldnt just passively use these systems without any deliberate consideration of pros cons
16,does anyone feel that self driving cars that talk to each other could be a bad thing i know it sounds like an ideal situation to eliminate traffic accidents and all that but i think and this is just me but can the cars be hacked information passing wirelessly between vehicles without human intervention leaves a lot of trust concerns should we start using self driving cars to transport our children to soccer practice it will happen trust me i dont think we are moving in the right direction on this idea
17,i see your point for overall safety and agree to an extent unfortunately it will take the lives of those whom befall the shortcomings of our trust in this technology to bear out the eventual statistical answer perhaps we should look instead at this technology as a better mass transit solution rather than individual owner option let that be the litmus test before we go full into this commercial automata that would also give the brunt of the infrastructure build and design on the local government vs the individual consumer having to flesh this thing out sorry i ramble
18,nothing but you can always design algorithms that dont need to exclusively trust one person contrary to the answers here cryptography is not necessarily the answer it can be part of the answer crypto is designed to solve two problems integrity tampering and privacy eavesdropping it is not a tool to ensure that the originator is not lying to your or is unfriendly you can solve the problem with something akin to distributed consensus if out of cars ahead of you say that they are braking due to high traffic around the bend but tells you to speed up you can slow down on the assumption that a majority of the people your encounter are not dicks think of it as finding trackers and seeders to a torrent once in a while you encounter malicious operatives but most of the time things work out quite ok and the systems are designed to compensate for noise hijacking corruption people entering and exiting the network etc
19,even self driving cars would have mechanical failures and cause and accident i dont trust this shit
20,cars would stop whenever a pedestrian approaches and not whenever they feel like it maybe also accidents happen all the time with human drivers too the quesiton is who is more reliable but yes public transport would be suerior oc
21,to be fair i trust the computer more than a human
22,tbh i would trust this million times more than human drivers
23,this was peak dumbass when people started believing this shit was possible ok so your plan is to replace cars and service vehicles with tech that remotely doesnt exist mind you despite your highway auto features you think are even close this level and make sure they can all reliable communicate with each other and a new grid and all software companies will play fair and every car owner will keep up maintenance to for community integrity and thats just to start i have an idea for an electric vehicle that can use less space carry way more people and still get you where you want to go safer and more efficiently than this dystopia you imagine choo choo choo mother fuckers choo choo choo
24,just start crossing that is unless you dont absolutely trust autonomous vehicles to avoid you could be a neat experiment
25,ive worked with self driving cars and even though they arent autonomous yet i trust them more than human drivers they also learn fast improving reaction daily the more they encounter the randomness of human behavior
26,well you just walk across the cars stop when there is an obstacle trust crossing anyone
27,start walking at trust the ai
28,hey ive work in automation for a long time and the solution would be very simple push a button that will activate a series of software logic events to alert cars in a certain radius a human is walking across the intersection the way i would do it is all algorithms that predict the vehicle is going to intersect or potentially intersect a human will be put into a safety mode basically slows the car down a lot emphasizes the camera systems to verify path isnt blocked and overall put each vehicle in a certain vicinity on a high alert for potential human injury once the systems for the cross walk verify all humans are across and the pathway is safe it will eliminate the high alert program and fall back into its routine by the time this is a thing all cars in a square mile radius will communicate will all other vehicles they will constantly be sharing vehicle speeds locations destinations future predicted routes and all kinds of things with every car around them and an extremely strong computer quantum computer possibly will make corrections to the flow of traffic accordingly we have many years before we eliminate stop lights and order traffic rules but when it happens its going to be super cool plus robots are x more reliable than a human could ever imagine
29,yeah i trust my brain more than his computer not worth it
30,leap of faith
31,why would you think that they wouldnt think about pedestrians you really think your gonna be like hey boss sorry im late ive been standing here on the corner for minutes but this new traffic system is so damn efficient there aint no time to cross for a wittle pedestrian such as myself thats silly trust in the professionals and the systems they have in place burd
32,personally i trust an automated car to stop when the system tells it to than a human driver texting while eating a slice of pizza
33,self driving cars dont need lanes and they dont need any more separation between cars than is necessary to let two streams of cars criss cross and turn at the intersection and pedestrians can just trust the car not to his them as they cross the road at any random spot riiight
34,i mean i do trust software more than humans to drive death machines if thats the only choice i have humans are unpredictable slow dumb and inattentive
35,this would suck and all but the software would be more reliable than humans
36,i trust computers on the road a thousand times better than idiot humans
37,or a mountain lionother wildlife they get hit by cars all the time im a driver these make me nervous call me crazy but i trust human decision making more than computers
38,i had to be the white south african trust fund baby idiot
39,i honestly would trust driving a bike on the road more with self driving cars around its still awful and there should always be separate bicycle lanes but still
40,the thing is that is exactly what everyone in this sub want protected bike lanes separated from traffic unfortunately much of our urban planning assumes the use of cars and nothing else no biker enjoys sharing the road with cars but they are forced to due to a lack of alternatives car brains assume that putting in bike lanes somehow infringes on their freedom to drive cars safely when bikers freedom to drive safely has been ignored the whole time putting in bike lanes helps car drivers it reduces car traffic by reducing car reliance and increases safety for everyone sounds like a win win why wouldnt you want alternative forms of transit i enjoy driving but i also enjoy biking and walking why should i be forced into this one mode car infrastructure also costs the taxpayer exponentially more than bike infrastructure
41,then you have no clue how far ai has come as long as we have humans at the wheel kids will die its beyond atrocious that you propagate that to be fair i said i trust but i should have said the data already shows that ai is safer you should research some topics before you write out things that arent true
42,hm i beg to differ in this one unreliable equipment that doesnt kill en masse is fine but this is a little over the top since the payers for this system are rich and could net us more profits what i say we do is create a free system for crossing that has a death rate then let people pay for ones with lower death rates getting gradually more safe the more youre willing to pay
43,well its currently the law that in self driving cars you are not allowed to take your hands off the wheel it is still considered reckless driving to take your hands off the wheel in a self driving car once the cars can be trusted enough where you can remove your hands from the wheels then we can make comparisons to our current laws
44,thats not the point here rolling through implies yielding yielding when its your right of way is perfectly safe and makes intersections more efficient for everyone blowing through when its not your right of way is definitely not safe and is idiotic these are completely different actions youre arguing in bad faith when you conflate the two
45,this always pops into my mind when talking about evs are there any reliable numbers about the difference in emissions for evs and traditional cars when the production of the batteries etc is taken into account
46,the solar panels on my roof or the gobs of windmills and solar farms around where i live that said there are valid arguments to be made for walkabilitybikeability and reducing our reliance upon cars of any type but its a plain fact that evs even powered by coal power plants have lower co footprint than ice vehicles youtubekmwdxmsn youtuberhtipefvzm
47,i dont think youre really aware of how cbtc actually works or how efficient trains are also its a lot better to just run as many as possible than to do some weird tech bro efficiency bullshit with it like rail examining the number of people waiting why having people state where theyre going this is horrible ux also why also train tickets turnstyles dynamically allocating trains to provide additional transit as necessary this already happens automatically slowing down certain trains by a couple minutes in order to alleviate congestion in stations what what congestion if theres congestion youd want more trains to move people this screws over people already on the train this makes them unreliable it is better for humans if there are consistent schedules without unexpected delays or speed ups like thats part of what makes taking the bus so horrible you dont know when its going to show up it gets stuck in traffic sometimes they skip your stop because the bus is full or the driver wants to and why would you need regenerative braking in trains do you know how trains work they speed up to the safest maximum speed then cut the power to slow down barely using brakes to come to a complete stop at the station if you ride a subway in a dense area like manhattan youll feel them pedal to the metal about halfway from station to station then they cut the power skilled operators can glide in in fact using the brakes on trains sucks horribly it fucks up your balance can make stuff knock over etc theres literally a japanese metro sim all about getting it as perfect as possible
48,trust me im the last person to defend teslas overall comfort and build quality but i think the noise has more to do with is being a tesla than being an ev
49,kids are isolated in the same way their parents are by suburbs actual quote from a policy maker in the s debt encumbered homeowners dont go on strike the whole point became to divide the working class geographically based on race because of the threat of socialism so whites fled to the burbs and the city became ghettoized and neglected people got houses the government got a reliable conservative political bloc and the system rolled on once that was in place neoliberalism was the inevitable result cars are very literally the result of an intentionally isolated and fragmented working class
50,still take up room and contribute particulate matter into the atmosphere the rubber from the tires result in breathing problems for those who live close to highways they are slightly better but really should not be seen as a panacea the goal should be to reduce reliance on cars this definitely includes all of elon musks tunnels
51,driving can be a fun activity but your hobby should not be enforced on everyone else to partake in especially when it causes many problems instead driving for sport or fun should take place in a controlled safe environment like a racetrack with people who enjoy the sport all around you im also not sure how you can like being stuck in traffic most days and find that fun maybe you arent usually stuck in traffic but for the majority of people driving in most places in the world that is the reality and it is not fun your experience of public transit was poor and that is one thing this subreddit is against we advocate for safer reliable frequent and fast public transit so that your commute of minutes could get down to or maybe even less in many places around the world public transit is the fastes option you also complain about the cleanliness of public transit and that could also be fixed you just need to help by advocating for more funding towards your local public transit system
52,the post itself says so someone else already replied dont ask me to waste my time in bad faith
53,i literally said that nowhere and neither does this post but my bad for putting effort into trying to educate you i didnt realize i was speaking to a sea lion for anyone else who had this same line of questioning in good faith i hope you got the info you needed
54,evidence trust me bro
55,ive seen videos of self driving cars swaying off a road because the maps arent accurate enough not gonna trust this technology for at least another years nor should anyone with any sense of self preservation
56,i will never trust a computer driver period dont give a fuck how advanced you think they are they just are not a person dont get how many people are so into this idea
57,i think its more competition for the overpriced rail industry then airlines over here in uk anyway would you rather stand and pay huge amounts to commute with unreliable train times and crammed into train cars or lay back and let your car drive you to work or your destination in comfort cheaper
58,i really dont know if i could ever trust a self driving car especially while i sleep the thought seems so fucking alien
59,yup i cant wait i know lots of people that dont trust the idea or dont like the idea but fuck that i love it imagine taking a nap on the way to work or having a designated driver built into your car or not having to deal with the stress of driving in an unfamiliar city once these things are fully autonomous ill sell a kidney for one if i have to
60,seeing people get excited about disrupting the airline industry makes me wish that we did some basic maintenanceupgrades on our train infrastructure years ago imagine if we converted our aging network of slow and decrepit trains into sleek reliable fast trains
61,unfortunately trains as sometimes x as expensive and not that reliable in where i am from poland
62,not always compared to low cost carriers like ryanair or easyjet trains are almost never cheaper but they are incredibly reliable in some countries switzerland and germany for example and faster than driving the same distance france tgv also you can buy unlimited use passes in many countries for annual or short term vacation trips xb cries in british southern rail
63,british trains are incredibly reliable minutes late of the time
64,thats if you want to trust a complete stranger being in your vehicle when you are asleep or not even present sounds like a good way to get robbedpickpocketed killed kidnapped etc
65,i have friends whom i dont trust with my car let alone a bunch of strangers
66,even then im not letting randos ride around in my car sure if they puke in it id know who did it and be able to bill them for cleanup or whatever but ive still got a random assholes puke soaked into my upholsterycarpet and even if i get it professionally cleaned on someone elses dime its gross that being said i dont trust the financial viability of individuals letting their autonomous cars serve as rideshare vehicles there are going to be companies doing the same thing and theyre going to be buying the vehicles and ancillary services like cleaning and maintenance in bulk and as such will be able to under cut individuals on pricing but your personal autonomous car wont be entirely worthless when youre not in it it could still do some neat stuff like go to a store while you sleep and pick up a product that you ordered so when you wake up your new toaster oven is waiting for you in the trunk
67,self driving cars as a concept are great but not everyone is capable of the engineering required to make a safe autonomous vehicle i would trust google x or tesla to make a good self driving car because they have the experience and talent in systems electrical software and mechanical engineering to pull of such a complicated project but uber is not on their level uber is not really a technology company theyre an appservice provider the uber app could be made by any year old app developer its not complicated so why is uber in the same conversation as companies that have been at the cutting edge of ai for the past decades
68,sounds great but does the average consumer want to give trust to a machine or do it themselves obviously crashes are gonna be higher with humans driving overall but that averages every idiot who cant even use a turn signal this will catch on eventually but i dont know if people are ready for that transition just yet
69,id rather trust a robot driving that is programmed to be safe than deal with the average driver from nj or nyc i see people so the dumbest shit and its fine autonomous cars with a manual override if needed be a thing
70,for anyone who trusts a car with toyota programming google toyota and global variables
71,i dont believe there are many people out there who expect or have ever expected self driving cars never to kill anyone ever which is a fatal misconception to even think thats a possibility plenty of people will walk right in front of them trust me
72,id happily give the responsibility of driving to an self driving car if that means everyone else does the same i know it can be counter intuitive to a lot of people but this will indeed save so many lives people used to not trust elevators when they first were invented they literally had to make sure an operator was inside the lift to press the buttons in order to create a sense of safety
73,yeah but you cant make something as inherently dangerous as being in a car on the road completely safe without making it so insanely expensive and impractical that it defeats the purpose and youll never eliminate all possible risk theres always freak occurrences and far too many variables anyway we already accept far greater risk when we get into a thinly plated metal cage weighing half a tonne or more traveling at kmhr on a narrow road in the opposite direction to other complete strangers doing the same thing with only human reflexes and just hope they arent drunk or mildly distracted and dont turn the wheel slightly and kill you both its interesting that we worry about other people having guns but well happily get on the road or cross a street and trust people not to point their weapons at at us and press the controlled explosion powered go button
74,do we trust corporate executives who probably have a stake in the success of self driving automobiles my vote is no
75,i know that autonomous cars are safer i have been following the studies and growth of the technology for years just as a curious hobbyist not an expert but there will come a time when a person or group of people is killed by an autonomous car and it will be all over the news and there will be a lot of people in the camp of i just dont trust them robot cars the data will not matter because even though autonomous cars are safer than human drivers there will be people who will wish for the system of human choice over the cold unfeeling determinism of machines
76,this is absolutely nothing new here we trust our lives to automated and other machines each and every day elevators escalators industrial equipment boilers gas lines traffic control systems the list goes on and on every single person encounters at least one machine that could quite easily kill them every single day with nobody at the wheel of these machines why we cant get our heads around this one is perplexing and its not even like we are even very good at avoiding killing ourselves with the current manned machines we are better at killing our selves with cars than the ai is right now forget even in years when the technology continues to improve
77,in a vacuum maybe everyone throwing their keys over to their new autonomous chauffeur forgets how far away this stuff really is sure theyre working in clear and sunny la but inches of snow in buffalo detroit where pot holes grow more than grass i dont think so not to mention the legal ramifications when people stop being at fault companies become at fault and we all know how good companies are at doing that you really trust tesla to value your safety over their bottom line not to mention security and privacy and that some people actually like driving when you only look at this from the perspective of dae not trust human drivers it seems a lot closer than it realistically is
78,toyota executive saying to trust how his cars are safe not biased and selfless certainly not interested by bigger sales and only aiming to make the world a better place s
79,theres zero chance that i will ever trust a computer to drive me around has anyone fucking used a computer jesus christ they are the most glitchy piles of shit ever
80,is there any possible argument against automation of driving all i have heard is i dont trust a robot driving me but they are happy to trust a human the amount of lives and travel time it will save is so astronomically huge that someone opposed to it would have to be insane
81,id trust a self driving car more than joe briefcase staring at his phone on the way to work i hope the minute it becomes feasible they outlaw driving your own car in my area south florida lol
82,on senors is anybody worried about people not maintaining their cars how many have driven around with a check engine light on now imagine people driving around with an intermittent sensor will people pay for repairs immediately or try to coast by will people possibly buy a car they cant afford to maintain and end up with a hazard to the public on the road or will we have to maintain our cars to the highest standards complete with maintenance logbooks day checks etc edit you guys have some great ideas but its not fool proof edit isnt the goal of self driving cars to not have humans drive ever or allow a car to drive an impaired person home sensors dont fail after a drive they can fail at anytime some sensors will fail intermittently or it will pass the bit built in test but display inaccurate information or lets say it fails reverts to manual control and the human being onboard is drunk edit i am a pilot and our airliners have lots of redundancy but systems and sensors still fail and its up to the human to sort them out if pulling over isnt an option which it isnt in an aircraft this is despite having highly regulated and mandatory maintenance ive had airspeed very important become unreliable loss of trim position indication think car doesnt know steering angle generator failures power distribution issues in which a bank of systems fail autopilot and autothrottle failures etc all of these passed their bits before going flying im just providing some food for thought i dont hate the idea of self driving cars but to say automation is always better than a human i dont think tells the whole story
83,laxer than uber will be responsible for maintaining and deploying sdv fleets in the poorer regions of america i dont trust them to be as safe as waymo or competent drivers
84,but you trust yourself and other humans considering the literal thousands of deaths each year often when one driver was doing nothing wrong whatsoever that seems misplaced statistically we dont seem to be very reliable drivers and if you consider the absurd amount of things that computers do the number of processes they are capable of handling just how many of them there are particularly if we include all smart devices and how many untold hours they are in use every single day by how many people id say they actually perform outrageously well but more importantly theres a really meaningful distinction between eliminating all accidents ever and drastically reducing the number of accidents no reasonable person would argue that self driving cars will never make mistakeshave glitchescause accidents but id straight up bet anything on their ability to outperform humans by orders of magnitude even as they exist right now much less after five or ten years

86,this exactly there was a recent cyclist killed by a tesla a lot of people saw that and went see self driving cars are not safe but the problem isnt wether or not theyre safe its wether or not we can trust the manufacturer to take responsibility or even be honest when the accident was caused by a lapse in the autonomous system
87,not at all you may have the right of way in the crosswalk but you will be dead right i dont trust anyone driving a k pound vehicle if you have been hit twice you are probably doing some shit wrong people are horrible drivers in general you just cant trust them to do what they should do protect yourself at all times
88,people say this but the reality just isnt with it people want reliable transport at their doorstep what youre describing is a taxi with a subscription service its been possible for decades but its not what people want because the convenience is in having the car then and there none of this wait half an hour for an available car because we fucked up how many we thought we would need in your area at this time
89,yes you are much less safe without automatic driving but you are putting your trust in people who have a horse in the race of your life
90,i can trust them not the government
91,i trust computers more than i trust distracted and sleepy people
92,if the driver thinks sleeping at the wheel is a good idea then i trust the car more than the owner i dont see why this is such a bad thing
93,i call shenanigans my tesla autopilot cuts off if you dont regularly jiggle the wheel on demand ive also had it just suddenly turn off in situations its not programmed to handle which my wife calls jesus take the wheel situations ive had the car for only a few weeks and am still learning the limits of autopilot its like being a drivers ed teacher i feel the need to be much more focused when its on to be ready if it turns off without warning the auto navigation has given me several scares and my trust level has dropped considerably while on the turnpike i set a course for a rest stop to get a supercharge first time it missed the exit second time it was going to take the exit at full speed which i had to abort i simply cannot imagine someone truly sleeping behind a tesla wheel
94,even if we had level whatever self driving cars i wouldnt really trust the system unless fully automated without direct human influence for example a driver steering the vehicle in anyway control functions like with trains excepted
95,hes putting wayyyyy too much trust on other people and people are idiots example this guy driving and recording at the same time
96,funny part is its not like hes coming out of a hour drive cross country just some dumbass completely trusting technology probably just got on the road why drive let the car do it play on your phone or even read a book but atleast be awake
97,i would not put that much trust into technology yet especially since this technology is still in its baby stages
98,i get why everyone angry but this dude full on trusting his car to automatically drive for him for tesla
99,teslas are not fully autonomous vehicles trusting them completely with your life is foolish there is a reason that all documentation from tesla says you need to keep your hands on the wheels and stay alert however the public messaging from the company is that you dont need to do any of that computers make mistakes all the time i dont care if you trust your life in it my life driving next to you is on the line im all for a day in the future when its been proven and tested properly but this is new tech being iterated on very often a programmer puts a bug through that has an issue and who knows what will happen
100,i find this both fascinating and maybe for lack of a better word stupid i think as a whole most of us humans are morons you can see it happening and im sure other prior events can do the same with the invention of smart phones people would rather answer a text than surveying the road as they drive or on a bike or when walking down stairs or walking in general you can put to the imagination all the accidents that do and will occur i used to joke about this sleeping in cars and now its happening doesnt matter if ai is safer than human driving its like trusting a stranger to watch your kid for minutes as you go to the bathroom
101,i will never trust self driving cars a little too minority report for me
102,that should be illegal any emergency override features in that car are useless and redundant when the occupants show such a lack of responsibilty personally i believe we put too much trust in technology
103,i find it amazing that people trust an emerging technology with their lives so completely xb if i went parachuting which i would never do because fuck that i would want at least back up parachutes and i would still be unconvinced that all of them werent going to fail
104,when theyre reliable enough to do it sure
105,yeah i dont know if i trust an ai to have the proper response to a buck charging towards the side of my car
106,im pretty sure they mean the expectation was that the operator should have been awake the trust of society at large for self driving vehicles isnt there yet in most places
107,fuck that cant trust a computer like that
108,no no no no no this kind of shit should never be the norm ever you dont let a pilot fall asleep with nobody else at the helm even though the plane can fly itself and said plane is thousands of feet above and away from any telephone poles or people or other such things it could strike because if things go wrong the computer cant be trusted to save the aircraft see the max as stinging and recent proof for how these systems can go wrong a car is in a far far more treacherous environment than an aircraft so its driver should always be alert of their surroundings regardless of what autopilot or self driving capabilities it has you know what forms of local transport remove all responsibility from you allowing you to sleep or play games or whatever buses trains or planes if you have to go farther take those instead if they arent available make your city invest in them theyre better for the environment than personal transport too talk like this makes me resentful of self driving car advocates because it basically says i want all the benefits of mass transportation combined with all the excess and waste of personal transport its a stupid stupid reason to want self driving technology
109,oh and other benefits you never have to defrost your car you never have to worry about maintenance you never have to get an mot you never have to change a tire you never have to gas it up you never have to park it you never have to wait for it to warm up in the mornings err just fyi this is not necessarily a good thing the way people handle maintenance right now is inconvenient sure but at least gives the consumer more power in this equation moving to a subscription based service you are going to be paying for maintenance for tire changes for gas and other wear and tear items on a vehicle but thats just going to be part of your fee the kicker here is that you no longer get to decide how they decide to perform their maintenance and with what parts companies down the value chain will start to charge premiums for their parts and the subscription service companiesfleet owners will pass that cost onto the end user tacked on with their own hidden fees to create extra revenue sure capitalism might dictate that competition will weed out any extraneous price gouging from the companies but in practice we as a society move closer and closer to consolidation and tech monopolies as time progresses you can argue that the cost savings from other benefits will cancel this out initially and that may be true but down the line this is going to be another part of the equation that is out of the consumers hands you have noted some tangible benefits but i dont have faith that the end user will win in this specific regard
110,i think a hurdle with self driving cars being accepted will be the types of crashes the accident rates will be lower overall but well see some really stupid autopilot accident a human would not do and find it hard to trust also we accept humans make occasional errors but anytime autopilot makes an error even if safer overall everyone will be sue the car company out of existance etc im sure well get there but it will take a while
111,i dont hate ryan air but no other airline tried to charge me for the privilege of sitting next to my partner theyre misers and stingy and theres always a catch everything is in bad faith you cant sit back and expect not to be fleeced its basically the option you pick if you dont care about having to micro manage a lot and pay a lot for extra bells and whistles nobody wants a ryan air experience with their car ooops you wanted a car with inflated tires sorry this one only comes with flat tires please pay for inflated tires
112,but most everyone that owns a car today will still own a self driving car in the future the early adopters sure will and when a company approaches them and says hey since its just parked on the street from can we lease it from you and rent it out basically like your car doing a second job being an uber whilst you still get to work fantastic right again that doesnt work its the same reason behind surge pricing most everyone needs their car at and and not any other time there is almost no one to rent your car to between and but everyone needs their car at to go home nor would most trust their car to strangers they dont care about getting compensated for getting throw up cleaned out of their car they dont want a strangers vomit in their car to begin with why dont i just sell it pocket the sale price and go to subscription myself and boom the industry is born because youll be paying more than simple ownership its the very same reason everyone doesnt take a taxi today
113,i actually had to argue with a girl in my college that eventually self driving cars will be safer she kept saying i cant trust a machine that can malfunction what in fifty years where theyre advanced enough to be faulty of the time ill take that over humans driving everyday
114,fuck no we all cant at least i cant and i know others are like me maybe if i was in first class with some provided xanax with the legroom ive been on intentional flights too and just cant do it if they make cars that are private it wouldnt be half as bad especially if those cars at the concept with four seats facing into a middle area like a limo section if self driving is very reliable i see that being pretty normal or somewhat normal
115,most everyone needs their car at and and not any other time i mean this is just not true at least not in my country every time i book a day off it blows my mind how busy everywhere is dont these people have jobs the customer is absolutely everyone who is getting a taxi during the day i mean this isnt even arguable i see tons of people driving around and using vehiclestaxisbuses all day long during work hours so initially theyd cannibalize the existing transport system or are you going to try to claim buses and taxis dont have a business from monday to friday nor would most trust their car to strangers this is the what if somebody was sick in the car problem already addressed this its really a non issue youre not renting it out to strangers and the company who is leasing it would provide protections and if they didnt well its a capitalist system dealers choice worried of the risk take a smaller cut and rent it to a supplier who guarantees replacements or higher paying customers the problem solves itself through the free market because youll be paying more than simple ownership sorry are you saying the subscription service will be more expensive than owning the car i mean if we accept that as the premise then nothing ive said makes sense at all if its not cheaper than ownership it is completely not viable
116,she trusts people waaaaaay more than i do
117,i cant trust a human that can malfunction
118,i guess it depends on the industry but remember that someone experienced with ongoing projects will be able to be much more productive than one who is not someone who is confident that they will be there for years will be more productive than someone who sees this as just a temporary jump etc there are good arguments for being a good boss and not running your workers into the ground and some businesses do quite well with such a strategy but many do not
119,not a bad problem to have i mean literally thats what donnation means i dont need it anymore compare that to the situation of charities that report because so many people scam online there are less and less people willing to donate online the general idea was we have unneccesary deaths people die one from a gunshot wound to the head the other one from a missing liver translant lets cut that short by taking the otherwise still useable gunshot victims liver and sowing it into the other patients body we can save one of them guaranteed the idea was never we have a right to those organ numbers we have a right to now demand those organs the idea was never we now get to complain because large numbers of organs are not there where we need them the general idea is innovate your way out of this for example allow some donors to decide for themself how their organs will be used for example i myself would have no problems with my organs being donnated to a poor schlob who never won anything to specify that if my reccipient has plans like climb mount everrest ride the bike or have an active and healthy social life go tell him to fck himself and prioritise the bottom of the list these people whom you wouldnt trust with a fresh vegan liver give them my liver put a smile on their faces shit on the guy who plans to run with the bulls or who has an instagramm account donnate your heart to the bottom of the transplant waiting list your liver to an recovering alcoholic your skin to someone who looks like a two and otherwise would need skingrafts from their own ass and your dick to someone who put chronic masturbation under hobbies let my shit go to people who actually appreciate it not take it for granted i could see a lot of people out of their free will donnating their organs and actually feeling good about it skin blood liver shit i take it like with the computer if anything can be reused before you toss it into the biohazard bin and burry it in an abandoned mineshaft be my gust grab what you need to when it is clear that i dont need it anymore just dont give it to the prick with the hope and stars in their eyes give it to themiserable bastard that has never won anything and make them for once feel like they own the world the downside would be that you would actually have to respect those wishes and such you know i will not be around to check anymore but i am sure it would be a hoot to tell mister schmidt from b that the medical board has a heart for him even though the medical board cant legally give that heart to anyone else but too often when a board decides who gets the organs and who gets a second chance i wanna wipe the smug grins off of their faces and go yea she ugly as fuck but shes a two so the rmeistermalkav clause grips and she gets his skin yes all of it see what she needs cut off the rest make a trendy bag out of it and this is where i see the problem the doctors would never agree to actually respect the donors wishes and hand over their power they would allways push for this little bit of extra of finger waving of such and of course there would be the the people that go i want my body parts to go to someone who is white i know it is harsh but better then publically whining about how fewer transplants we will have because more and more people will surive would be to take the good with the bad just increase the numbers every racist bastard who gets his wish means one fewer place on that list needing to be filled an other option would be medically assisted suicide i am dead serious on that one if all you care is get places of of that list go fuck your ethics board untill they bleed from both ends and offer assisted suicide have a suicide coaster in the back that kills you in a painless safe and guaranteed way in exchange for the right to harvest the organs of course respect these peoples wishes what they want to be done with the organs and the grafts but in the end if you are good enough to whine publically about the list let me remind you that if you pushed for harvesting rights to suicide victims bodies your numbers would look quite different yes there would be the option about not doing harm but that could be done with a patient activated mechanism or and this would be my preferred option actually look into technology look into artificial hearts look into stem cell research and make sure all your people on that waiting list understand that if they vote the people against stem cell research out of office they may actually do the world a bigger favor then by leaving them in and just signing up to be donors just you know become single issue voters for an election my best case only hand the advertising contracts to inform about organ donnations to people who are donors make fun fact sheets allow me to specify my wsh that nobody who is an sjw should get anything from me but if there is any miserable sick son of a bitch that is just a grouch give him my body and tell him to toast me once in a while staple it in and see how it goes use what you can from my body and go fuck your ethics board if you can get it out of my body without retching uncontrollably you are entitled to have it if any of my body ends up in an art project go buy a big pack of smokes for the nearest smoker and tell him my story but i would rather rot completely intact underground and make sure maggots and shit get my body then go to the afterlife with the secure knowledge that my bodyparts are taken for granted and to be distributed as seen fit by a team of medical experts
120,solution is simple just program in cars not to try and avoid an accident chances are well even have an influx of organs to donate good job whoever wrote this article i feel like we are focused on the right things my faith in the human race is renewed
121,i am on the transplant waiting list for a kidney for the second time in my life and very likely not my last my kidney failure was caused by a rare genetic disease where my own immune system attacked my kidneys beginning around the age of it is called dense deposit disease i would prefer than any life that can be saved would be however it can be saved i dont like the idea of this being referred to as an unintended consequence the intention is always to save as many lives as possible there are lots of different potential treatments on the horizon for esrd im personally looking forward to when we can produce an organ for a patient that cannot be rejected thereby eliminating the need for immunosuppressive medication these medications often create a whole host of other issues such as an extensive list of side effectsresulting in using medication to treat the side effects and increased chance of catching other diseases and illnesses during the time with my first transplant that didnt last long due to some of the aforementioned complications i got bk virus normal immune systems are exposed to this but know how to handle it shingles norovirus twice within a month and several other issues too plentiful to list now all in the short two years i had it to me the real solution is not more organ donors but instead more reliable treatments that provide a long term solution that does not require multiple transplants over the course of ones life i know people who are working on transplant number three or four
122,i think that the day where manual labour is taken over completely by machines while corporate jobs are all practised from our very own homes through the internet thus making of all traffic unnecessary is closer by than the day where self driving cars could be considered remotely reliable
123,no it wont a huge part of the population cant afford a new car or wont trust a self driving car and will hold out as long as they can you see cars over fifty years old on the road regularly not common but they are out there cars are very common
124,agreed im confident these two methods of obtaining organs will replace each other and with d printing you can fabricate organs a lot faster then people are dying and without people dying because face it if we make it through the next years on good terms human life expectancy will rise and less people will by dying from disease then ever before this will obviously create more and more problems where organ donation is concerned on the other hand less people will let be needing organs as humans are able to prevent more and more of the failures that result in the need for an organ
125,too bad he waited until it was too late to trust actual medicine he never should have been in the position to require the transplant
126,while at a system level the decision will be made by government types at the ground it will be the individual are they comfortable giving up control of the vehicle despite the average person believing they have above average driving skills if its uber auto pilot will they just accept it and trust because thats the only reasonable option available or because of cost this is only a transitory phase anyway progress will continue to be made and in a year or so autonomous cars will be that much better than humans at driving give it years and us meat bags wont have any more excuses
127,thats a nearly religious statement youve no data for that you cant its faith in computers and their superiority beta software should not drive cars
128,even early iterations of aircraft auto pilot systems were pretty unreliable especially auto landing and ils
129,stop these articles stop saying death equivalency is good enough thats not the issue at all this issue is that driving in a automated car was like being taken on a ride by a depressed chauffeur huffing glue sure most of the time he does great but every once and a while he does something completely irrational before passing out leading to easy fatalities we have to be able to relax ourselves these articles advocates blind trust it doesnt matter if my chauffeur thinks its okay to drive full speed into the side of a semi truck sometimes because hes still better than the average driver does the psychological mindset of the passengers matter at all this is not respect or trust its blind submission to a ridiculously flawed driver what if this chauffeur was x more likely to cause life crippling permanent injuries in every crash than the average driver what if every fatality it caused was a small child that he runs over at mph because those damn kids are too small to see yet he still only killed as many humans as the average driver nhtsa is right to advocate for x less fatalities before its ready i think were getting pretty close to trustworthy self driving cars and most people dont realize how damn easy it will be to achieve once we have the right software
130,no thanks i trust myself more than a machine never will have a self driving car
131,i totally trust an emerging multi billion industry regarding gym personal safety and their product
132,i trust more a semi autonomous car still in development than those drivers in florida
133,i admit im concerned at this point on a strictly personal level i plunked my modest k down for the model specifically for the autopilot i work a lot at various locations and i was all over this technology until i read about the car hitting a damn fire truck at a standstill while in autopilot mode or however you want to word it company statement is basically we told you not to rely on autopilot well thats the only reason id spend the money on this car to begin with so if its not reliable im thinking i dont need it at this point it seems im still a better driver than what theyve got going i dont hit fire trucks at a standstill or people walking their bikes across the street im a very defensive careful driver i thought they were better i think ill wait until they are
134,human beings are far too defective to avoid being killed by something that has special programming to avoid killing them the vast bulk of the legal code exists because adult human beings cannot be trusted to make good decisions there are valid philosophical arguments to be made about many of these laws if not the majority of them nonetheless whether it is commerce or crossing a street short sighted poor choices seem to be unavoidable
135,people have a particular horror of being killed by machineskiller robots dont sound so far fetched these days one of the reasons we arent so afraid of being killed by human drivers it that another human driver has an interest in avoiding any accidentthey might be injured or killed themselves after all we have an inherent level of trust in our own mutually shared instincts for self preservationbut a machine has no skin in the game literally
136,why was i hit with rule and and you werent ____________________________________________________________________________________________ yes autonomous cars are going to kill people before they save lives expert says by izumi in rfuturology izumi s point days ago yes yes it does that is the unvarnished reality today autonomous cars especially semi autonomous cars are going to kill people before they save lives yes humans will die in level autonomy sdvs there is no avoiding it but what is say human lives per year from sdv related causes vs from human caused mvas ill tell you what it is unacceptable to usa society and i understand the goal is zero deaths due to human caused mvas but the implication of that statement is that it is highly likely that more human lives will be lost to the development of this technology despite our best efforts to avoid that outcome i seriously suspect that this is more of an over exuberant business model than a technological obstacle yes that was directed straight at tesla the automobile manufacturers are putting these into vehicles as an attractive futuristic feature the idea behind these level and level hand offs is that the human stays fully alert and hands on the wheel at all times but people being people get bored and think things are under better control than they may actually be then they start watching movies and climbing into the backseat to film the miracle of technology or worse there is conflict in the engineering itself which caused that uber tempe incident tesla itself states that the driver should keep hands on the wheel observant even during auto pilot mode people just dont follow the rules is all then one or another human is killed in direct relation to the developing technology and everyone gets all bent out of shape and wants to ban the further development of sdvs altogether never mind that more than humans were killed by human caused mvas that day i dont know i guess we have to just suck it up with this level and level autonomy as we proceed towards full level autonomy a level in which there is no steering wheel no brake and no accelerator and i say thank god we are going to see this in less than years the combination of mapping tracking intervehicle communication and of course that intrinsic ai that is going to bring about a revolution like nothing seen on earth since the horse stopped being the main mode of human transportation around i just dont want anything to disrupt or slow the advance of this technology and its implementation into society waymo and apple among several others are developing exclusively level autonomy sdvs they have known from the start that you cant halfstep this technology it is all or nothing and all is going succeed seriously i discussed this just yesterday here is the link if you are interested but have faith yes faith in this astonishing convergence of technologies oh and by the way guess what there is also serious work on level autonomy human passenger carrying drones as well they could well transcend ground sdvs altogether permalinksavecontextfull comments editdelete
137,this is what i tell people who tell me they wouldnt trust a computer to drive a car the computer is still going to make way less mistakes than a human
138,ya know whats even more reliable than self driving cars mass transportation railways but noooooo america has to invest in more fucking cars than anything remotely practical
139,not gonna lie but i rather take the few extreme cases of stupid causing a self driving car to crash than the several thousands of stupid people on the road every day causing crashes and crashing into shit and people i trust something that cant get drunk or be allowed onto the road with a mental problem alot more than someone that has those things
140,as someone who works in insurance as a liability adjuster the current stance is whoever the owner of the car is mainly because you choose to let a currently unreliable technology make the decision for you and thats on you
141,i get it you think you are in control and that youre not at risk but you most definitely are good drivers die every day by the dozens and this technology will reduce the fatality rate immensely yes it introduces a new agent into the equation robo driver and that robot wont be perfect but it will be better its natural to fear this new risk and to want to stick with what youre used to but the net risk is going to go down big time allow me to illustrate hypothetically lets say your chances of dying of cancer in the next years is but a new free pill came out on the market that can almost eliminate your risk of cancer dropping your probability of cancer death to however that pill also adds a side effect that may cause it to actually give you cancer the probability of that happening is so this new pill lowers the probability of cancer death by a huge amount but in very rare cases it actually causes cancer death should you take that pill of course you should take that pill which will reduce your probability of cancer death from to it would be dumb to get caught up on the fact that the pill adds a new risk of cancer when it more than offsets that new risk by eliminating of the current risk the pill way improves your probability of avoiding death overall so dont be a dummy use it by the same token we should adopt the new safer form of transportation sure the robot could fuck up and kill you but the odds of it happening will be lower than very good human drivers yourself included killing you there will be no reward for taking the extra mortality risk associated a human driver the machines are already better than humans at most maneuvers and it is a matter of time until they dominate us across the board it will be very soon only hard headedness fear of change distrust of machines and ego will hold this process back prepare yourselves to take this damned pill people it will almost certainly improve your life and the lives of others like the elderly it will reduce fatalities and injuries it will solve traffic jams it will be soooooo much better embrace it
142,your trusting the thousands of other strangers every day when you drive you dont have to die because of your screw up you are more likely to die because of someone elses screw up already an old lady ran up the curb thinking she was hitting the break when she floored the gas and smashed my mom through a brick wall breaking dozens of bones and causing internal bleeding thats not my moms screw up thats shitty human drivers
143,we have this in the uk its great but we do care who pays use of the system by non citizens is political attempts to verify eligibility are difficult because we dont have id cards thankfully also local trusts are allowed to allocate priorities so that there is a postcode lottery for access to some treatments variations in outcomes across the country but this is complicated because poor areas rich areas differ in so many ways private healthcare is legal doctors will often do private work after their nhs working day this has complicated effects upon the system patient outcomes its not obvious whether the overall effect is good or bad its not even obvious within the system whether going private is the best option advice can be conflicting because of politics as well as differences in clinical opinions so again it still matters who pays car insurance is a legal requirement in the uk which is sensible in theory but results in dysfunctional market behaviour with disproportionate costs for younger drivers i think that it should therefore be run as a government monopoly a national insurance service so that the risk is equally shared across the population the disadvantage of this sort of system is that it removes the incentive to reduce risk by eg buying lower performance vehicles with lower replacement value however most people have no more desire to damage their car than their health even if the government bears the financial cost so i think that the good outweighs the bad if healthcare car insurance are both provided by central government the savings associated with self driving cars are passed on to taxpayers rather than taken as profit by private industry which is probably a good thing because it may be argued that this will increase spending therefore growth more effectively
144,i agree and its not just reddit its the industry too a colleague went to a transportation conference and shared his experience with us almost everything was about autonomous cars with very little emphasis on public transit or how the tech can be applied to public transit networks in an ideal world id like to see the tech improve existing public transit with cars filling in the gaps that arent covered adequately like the person who commented about his shiftslocation in this thread its sad because i really believe that this tech can provide cheap reliable and efficient transportation with no reason for anyone to own a car but it seems like the focus is on everyone owning a driverless car that will sit in the lot of the time in other words how can we sell as many cars as possible
145,only because cities are built for that to be the case my point is to build infrastructure that doesnt feed a cycle of car reliance
146,not sure how youre asking this question or what is so confusing to you if ai is driving it seems to me that the developers are at fault not me the only thing i did wrong in the situation was trust the car to drive without crashing so i guess its my fault still
147,this works only if the communications are reliable and trustworthy however they are not imagine what you could do by screwing with inter car communications on demand traffic jam no problem i think that self driving cars will be forced to rely almost entirely on internal sensors for the foreseeable future which doesnt mean there wont be any improvements to traffic flow simply due to better situational awareness and faster reactions
148,this works only if the communications are reliable and trustworthy however they are not imagine what you could do by screwing with inter car communications on demand traffic jam no problem i think that self driving cars will be forced to rely almost entirely on internal sensors for the foreseeable future which doesnt mean there wont be any improvements to traffic flow simply due to better situational awareness and faster reactions
149,people are to damn trusting with their lives yeah im really not first in line to hop in a self driving car speeding down a rural road i just cant believe this is what people want from the future
150,of course there are i think it comes down to what you put more faith into yourself or the car and i hope i can trust myself more than a computer
151,of course there are i think it comes down to what you put more faith into yourself or the car and i hope i can trust myself more than a computer
152,and i hope i can trust myself more than a computer thats kind of silly if were at a point where computers are proven to do something better than humans
153,where did i say i was better lol indeed am very safe driver people are already so dependant on assisted steering etc i drive a manual toyota pickup with bald tires and drive better than a lot of the newbs i see new trucks in ditches every time it snows and my is just fine even with no sandbags its sketchy af if you dont know what youre doing you will spin out but im very tender with her anyway i dont trust the automatic cars yet just wait til a school bus or something gets rammed also im not the entire country of the us and drive waaaaaay better than most
154,i think its gonna be a while before we trust the technology to completely replace you think not only about the technology but all the legislation necessary to make this a viable thing washington dont move that fast youre probably good for a while lol
155,the technology is still pretty crappy i think there are other issues in the trucking industry that are more pressing driver shortagehtml driver shortagehtml i just now started trusting my taffic jam assist system to work most of the time it is pretty good but even in that limited capacity it still needs to be watched like a hawk autopilots for planes are much better but there has been a lot more years of development of the three axis coupled auto pilot and auto throttle compared to self driving systems flying is fundamentally less complex than driving you dont fly really close to other planes and you dont fly right behind one that could do something wild unexpectedly right now the human computer is better than the electric one at driving a car
156,how far along are self driving cars they are safer cheaper in the long run assuming enough are made to make up for development costs and more reliable than human drivers should i be worried for my future as a truck driver no politicians dont care as much about something being safer than human drivers as they do about allowing this would make truck drivers vote for the other guy after all people that die in traffic accidents can no longer vote or but even if ten times fewer traffic accidents happen ill get blamed for those ones
157,xb mid thirties single with k usd in cash no house no debt my physician career too stressful do i just push on for more yrs do i start over and retrain as software engineer my childhood dream no you do not push on for years hopefully if you are a decent physician you understand the negative effects of mental stress and daily unhappiness many people have changed careers much later in life than mid s xb could i smartly invest large chunk in cryptostock to make money and do low paid job crypto seems like an unreasonable risk to me there are much safer reliable and predictable investment options you can discuss this in rpersonalfinance
158,its more fear mongering probably by people who are scared of technologydont like change facts are a machine us far more reliable than a human especially since the machine isnt going to go out drunk driving
159,thats absolutely not a fair comparison trust me you wouldnt like it if your dental work was done by self taught pro
160,meh im more impressed by cars that cant drive themselves but have cheaper sensors and less reliance on maps thanks for the video though
161,i dont trust that a sick driver is willing to give up their only source of income if the choice is eating vs spreading disease i think most people would choose the former
162,you misunderstand first let me clarify my statement i am saying that it would take tesla more than years to create something as confidentreliable as this video with their current hardware and i know they plan on continuing with this hardware as that is their strategy and they have been promising fsd with this current hardware take a company that is pretty good at innovating i agree tesla is great at innovating and an extremely exciting company however for them to create what you see in this video with their hardware and strategy will several times harder than what waymo has done it will require vastly more technology breakthroughs that are not in the foreseeable future if tesla were to drop their current strategy and hardware and start over and create a waymo clone i am sure they could do that in years or so but they do not intent to do that when you have pretty much half a million cars or more collecting driving data worldwide on edge cases sigh you and everyone else have got to drop this man its a useful tool but is really far less relevant and important than you believe waymo has at last publishing in a fleet of vehicles even if they quadrupled that its still less than vehicles out in the wild collecting data irrelevant i dont think its a hardware issue at this time its more getting the software right yes but when you have less hardware redundancies the software doesnt need to be a little better it needs to be x x times better k people that already bought it its going to be a massive change only k its gotta be higher than this tesla is selling k vehicles per quarter years is probably my best case idea for teslas software to be at this level we are seeing i share your excitement and enthusiasm its fun to dream i agree wouldnt that be something if that turned about to be the case but i hope you arent getting in to deep into the fantasy

164,ive honestly never heard anyone say its bad now the window wipersmakes me lose my faith in camera based ai
165,honestly makes it sound like the audience is supposed to believe you more now but people wont trust you more because you say youre being honest its just another claim from the same person they didnt completely trust to begin with
166,dude stop playing dumb everyone knows that the word honestly in this context is meant to imply that other people may be dishonest on the issue nobody uses that word to imply they are often dishonest it is used to amplify the conviction seriousness and truth in the thought in a similar way as terms like trust me or frankly
167,itll happen as soon as they get enough riders someone will post a video to snapchat first thinking it isnt covered by the nda because its just to a friend i trust and hey snapchat is private and then that friend will extract the video and send it to a wider audience one of whom will send it to the press and then finally someone will put it on youtube
168,just give us driverless cars already ive been waiting for this for years taxisubers are expensive unreliable and unsafe i dont want people getting intoxicated and driving but that level is different for different people
169,i would personally never trust this edit i worded this horribly id prefer to drive a car than it drive me
170,once self driving cars become good and people trust them more i guarantee we will see a day when itll be illegal for a human to drive
171,you do realise the most frequent cause of accidents is humans right so take humans out of the equation and accidents will vastly decrease the contention at the moment is who is at fault if a self driving car has an accident also its hard to have self driving cars whilst silly humans are still driving around to say you wouldnt trust it what are you basing this on is a deep knowledge of ai and self driving cars or just sounds new dont like it
172,no id just prefer not to trust something until its been used for a while
173,self driving cars wont be the norm for a long long time think about the thousands of cars you see every day wherever you live they arent going anywhere anytime soon especially as cars are nicer safer and more reliable than theyve ever been even a car from doesnt seem as old today as a car from did then a car likely wont feel that old in barring some massive unseen tech advance on the level of the smartphone the poor people who cant afford anything but a year old beater what would they do what about all the year old classics people still own and drive today human driven cars will be around for at least the next few decades if not the rest of the century
174,laws being changed require time and something more than hey this is a possibility for a handful of vehicles and i dont really care what the rates are i would rather have the ability to have an emergency override and save myself than trusting a computer that may glitch out
175,they will when they are confident their systems are working perfectly an accident involving a self driving car and a human driven car will be faulted to the human driver an accident between two self driving cars simply wont happen
176,what do you mean years away tesla already has mostly self driving capabilities and theyre not the only ones with interests in the market the technology is literally around the corner once again society is the only thing that will hold the technology back the average person wants to trust themselves more than they trust technology but those same people use their phone for basic math instead of trusting their own intelligence
177,thats precisely what i meant the technology is there but adoption is years away at least widespread where its more common to have a self driving car for the average consumer than a manually driven car theres numerous factors that limit this beyond just people wanting to trust themselves cost in an era with wage stagnation and rising costs of living there are entire demographics that have no car or can only afford to buy year old beaters every couple years these people wont be able to likely own one of these self drivers for a generation or two the middle ish class that can afford new cars within the current generation will likely hold off on adoption until its proven technology as many of these people have families that will not trust in the hands of a computer yet this leaves consumer adoption with the wealthy elite that have both need and money or the technically affluent that stays with the latest developments regulation this is probably going to be a slow nut to crack until its been proven and insurance companies get fully behind it easier than pricing but harder than the development of the tech used car market this is basically where the majority of america buys through and as i stated most car models see years in circulation overall it will take at least this long for self drivers to be widely available to consumers i expect the business market like trucking and cabs to be pushed for first and then another for non self drivers to cycle out of the market to where having a manual car is as rare as owning a car with manual transmission is today then another years where a non self driver is a classic collector type thing my year statement was that it would take that long for self drivers to be widespread ie the primary car type
178,the problem with self driving cars is trust im not entirely sure that i trust a self driving car to take me where i tell it to every single time maybe the car decides that ive been to the liquor store or the casino too many times this month maybe the local authorities are quietly routing me around a traffic disruption or maybe theyre deciding what i need to see or not see out my windshield or what protests or political assembly i should attend or avoid sure you have the right to keep and bear arms but the autonomous vehicle network wont take you to the gun store a business paying for seo or outright higher placement on the search is one thing but what happens if mcdonalds pays your automaker for preferential destination placement take me to burger king please hal im sorry dave im afraid i cant do that how about the mcdonalds down the road and thats not even taking things like arrest or abduction into account
179,dont bother reading you will be dumber for doing so this has to be one of the most ignorant articles i have ever read it is full of biased and contextually wrong information plus it just makes no sense a full self driving vehicle completely removes a driver for the simple fact of being a better more reliable driver in theory so people losing driving skills has no bearing on the quality of self driving plus it mentions the boeing max which was a completely idiotic and deadly failure on boeings part of how they programmed a critical component with no backup sensor to drive the plane nose down into the ground nothing whatsoever to do with the pilots lack of capability
180,just like cars led to people not knowing how to saddle and bridle a horse technology moves forward we leave the antiquated behind people are bad at driving if and when reliable and safe alternatives arise why would we need to know how to do something from the past no one laments not knowing how to yoke cattle to plow fields
181,i learned how to drive a stick with an old honda my friend was nice enough to let me grind the gears on on the con side nothing quite like being at a stoplight on a grade feeling not very confident with someone up your ass on the pro side theres also nothing like push starting your car when the battery dies
182,we also need to know if theyre in any way pulling people out of mass transit and into cars since that is the among the worst possible results of such a service while were at it we need to know how many drivers are using the service and how much demand on parking area is reduced also we need to know if a permanent reliable transit line could be offered to replace these rides
183,yay trusted computing on wheels protecting the government from pesky peons moving around without permission
184,has this been reported by other newspapers that are not bezos not saying this is not true but i trust wp on tesla the same way i trust fox news on well everything
185,cant trust elon he is going to bitch and whine about this
186,its not only the technology that needs to be heavily regulated but the marketing and advertising auto manufacturers are making bold claims and selling this technology to normal folks who dont understand just how complex these systems are or how prone to failure they can be people are far too trusting of this tech and its going to get people killed
187,why do so many trust tesla when they know despite what system you work with there will be bugs and computer crashes why would tesla software be any different nothing is or ever will be perfect including tesla there will be faults coming from software design software coding software evaluation hardware design hardware faults and human interaction tesla undoubtedly knows all this and upgrading software introduces a level of uncertainty that is well uncertain some may think that the market will correct any problems that may be true but how many people have to get injured or die for that to happen should we let that happen when we ie the people and government might reduce the chance of future incidents the introduction of standard practices that must be followed
188,they want the cars to drive by themselves the company is assuring us that the software is safe and they shouldnt need to have any outside testing done on it were supposed to just allow them to download updates which may or may not release the cars upon our roadways like a menace the company says its safe and that were supposed to trust them when the cars suddenly start slamming on the breaks in the middle of the highway they just say oops that was a bad update the company doesnt want any oversight or regulation about this they want to be able to test and then implement anything they want without any supervision or input from anyone its crazy to allow them to do this
189,would you rather be on the road with a properly licensed regulated responsible driver who is not just half assed tested once in his entire life back in the teen years and in a society where we dont pressure people into driving when tired and give people ample cheap public transportation and remove unfair stigmas against it so they can use alternate transportation when needed or let technology we dont even trust to run our dumb little phones correctly do something as important and mission critical as drive a car something that not only can potentially endanger the passenger but people in other cars and property around them regulation and change has to happen technology isnt the solution to everything since technology isnt perfect and can potentially be far more dangerous than a distracted driver our over reliance on technology has gotten us into a world full of anti privacy and anti freedom as well as so many other things that has dehumanized us to a point where we are essentially a slave to it technology has to be a tool not a means to an end we cannot allow automated driving to exist as it would cause so many more issues than it would solve as well as further erode privacy and freedom yes humans driving are problematic but solving that issue by doing common sense things to help our society eliminate a large number of these problems is a far better solution than further enslaving ourselves to repressive big brother technology im a lifelong sysadmin and programmer ask anyone like me and theyll say the same dont let technology run our lives its not anti technology its anti control and technology isnt reliable or secure enough in any situation to allow it bugs and hacks will happen and theres no way to safeguard it
190,would you rather be on the road with a properly licensed regulated responsible driver who is not just half assed tested once in his entire life back in the teen years and in a society where we dont pressure people into driving when tired and give people ample cheap public transportation and remove unfair stigmas against it so they can use alternate transportation when needed or let technology we dont even trust to run our dumb little phones correctly do something as important and mission critical as drive a car something that not only can potentially endanger the passenger but people in other cars and property around them regulation and change has to happen technology isnt the solution to everything since technology isnt perfect and can potentially be far more dangerous than a distracted driver our over reliance on technology has gotten us into a world full of anti privacy and anti freedom as well as so many other things that has dehumanized us to a point where we are essentially a slave to it technology has to be a tool not a means to an end we cannot allow automated driving to exist as it would cause so many more issues than it would solve as well as further erode privacy and freedom yes humans driving are problematic but solving that issue by doing common sense things to help our society eliminate a large number of these problems is a far better solution than further enslaving ourselves to repressive big brother technology im a lifelong sysadmin and programmer ask anyone like me and theyll say the same dont let technology run our lives its not anti technology its anti control and technology isnt reliable or secure enough in any situation to allow it bugs and hacks will happen and theres no way to safeguard it

192,theres joy in being an early adopter and eas are who help push a lot of tech forward that said self driving cars are not an area where this level of risk to others is an acceptable tradeoff for advancement and tesla has shown they cannot be trusted to deliver safe products without strict regulatory oversight
193,id trust even the most broken releases of autopilot over any non professional driver not because autopilot is particularly good but because humans are terrible
194,every time i talk about how much i love and hate tesla any tesla zealot will usually be like and dont tell me panel gaps like yall seen how bad those are or what i mean its pretty low on my list of reasons why i hesitated to buy a tesla even with all its flaws its just priced so well and gives a lot for its money and it sure as hell has a lot going for it but i really really do not trust the tesla corporation one iota
195,if we are talking about safety chritical a human can take over at any time thats not considered a reliable fail safe for a couple of reasons humans cant react as quickly as computers can so if a computer makes a wrong decision it will take a human longer to make a right decision and at mph that can be deadly additionally theres a wealth of research showing that people monitoring automated systems just stop paying attention after a while so the odds that the driver will catch an error in time drop dramatically as trip length increases
196,the only truly important regulation would be car makers are liable for all accidents caused by the self driving car that alone should guarantee that they will spend billions of dollars in research ensuring that the car is both safe for autonomous driving as well as secure against remote hacks any other fixed regulation will just get them to comply with the minimum legal requirements and there isnt any guarantee that those regulations are perfect or even optimal for self driving car safety in fact the government has even hinted that it doesnt want to impose too many regulations on the car makers because its still an infant domain it makes sense but as i said if they were reliable that would be all the incentive they needed to ensure maximum safety and security
197,i know tesla and google are both pushing for this they trust their tech
198,and people dont die because were more reliable than machines s
199,good point many people dont have the vaguest idea how reliable specifically designed hardware and embedded software are they think its going to be as reliable as their home pc when its much closer to being as reliable as a hand held calculator i doubt any of us even know someone who had a hand held calculator ever return the wrong value
200,if you let these things onto the road in imperfect condition you are sure to kill any chance of building enough trust with consumers for wide implementation no one is going to want a self driving car if they hear about self driving car accidents regularly and you can bet your ass that every mass media outlet will bring every single incident in the largest possible headline font people wont care what statistics say if they keep hearing about how self driving cars are dangerous because x of them crashed or had near accidents in the past month
201,are you saying that they dont use the same rules for counting manual and autopilot accidents according to their safety report methodology listed on the bottom of their safety report page methodology we collect the amount of miles traveled by each vehicle with autopilot active or in manual driving based on available data we receive from the fleet and do so without identifying specific vehicles to protect privacy we also receive a crash alert anytime a crash is reported to us from the fleet which may include data about whether autopilot was active at the time of impact to ensure our statistics are conservative we count any crash in which autopilot was deactivated within seconds before impact and we count all crashes in which the incident alert indicated an airbag or other active restraint deployed our crash statistics are not based on sample data sets or estimates in practice this correlates to nearly any crash at about mph kph or above depending on the crash forces generated on the other hand police reported crashes from government databases are notoriously under reported by some estimates as much as in large part because most minor crashes like fender benders are not investigated we also do not differentiate based on the type of crash or fault for example more than of all autopilot crashes occur when the tesla vehicle is rear ended by another vehicle in this way we are confident that the statistics we share unquestionably show the benefits of autopilot there isnt a differentiation between the manual or autopilot methodology in here so its very apples to apples
202,i would say self driving cars are safe to a point i still wouldnt trust a sdc with the moral quandry of preserving the life of a driver or pedestrian and having to make the choice of whether the car should or shouldnt hit a pole to avoid the pedestrians
203,let us think about this for a moment at the moment a human driver might possibly go to jail if they are negligent in driving its rare of course but that is the ultimate consequence that faces everyone when they drive does anyone think an american executive is going to stand trial in the uk accused of negligence not going to happen ever i really dont trust american corporate culture to prioritise human lives if all that will happen is they pay out some cash
204,sounds like they got the judgement spot on the instructions were clear im pretty confident that fuck around on your cell phone wasnt in the list of acceptable behaviour not sure what their background adds either tbh
205,yes and amazingly the program written by the car company records that the cause of the accident is always the fault of the driver and you can absolutely trust that because its not like global car companies have a history of programming cheat code into their cars
206,third party damage id say you recoup your loss the same way as loss through any other type of accident or a more accessible small claims court but that would screw people over that need it the most so good catch i think food a basic food package should be a human right the reliance on food banks for the poorest is a travesty survival should be easy
207,ok looks like we can trust tesla not convinced anout the europeans though they have previous
208,the sensor system will have to have a lot of checks and redundancy so that it will be next to impossible that it fails without the driver getting a warning to take over im confident it will be possible to make the risk of this happening extremely small
209,ive been thinking that self driving cars wont kill car mechanics but will usher in an era of highly certified car mechanics i think of airplane mechanics who work on highly reliable parts that peoples lives depend on
210,yeah the car parts of the car wont change much at least vs existing hybrid cars i wouldnt trust johnnys fix a flat to mess with the electronics that decide when not to run over children
211,preppers love thinking of worst case scenarios its literally the whole trope but sdc designers will be doing that too every car gets dirty dirt is not a new or surprising element in vehicle design of course you still have to trust the code and youve no way of knowing that if youre not careful itll take you to a fema camp when the nwo takes over un take the wheel s
212,there are other ethical situations where the pedestrian isnt at fault what if a car coming the opposite way swerves right in front of you at the last second your self driving car can brake all it wants but it may have to swerve in order to avoid the collision now what if there are pedestrians on the sidewalk of the road what would probably happen in that situation is that the car will allow the collision to happen since cars are designed for hitting each other and there would be nothing to protect swerving into the pedestrians that seems like the logical choice but there is another argument to be made too should the car protect the driver at all costs the driver is surrendering themselves and giving all trust and control in this car would it be ethical for it to allow the driver to be hurt over other people who arent involved with the car the reason people are talking about these hypothetical situations is because they will have to be decided before the situation becomes a reality these conditions will have to be explicitly set in the rules logic this isnt an area where we can say well see what happens these kind of decisions will have to be explicitly laid out and i think thats what people get hung up on a programmer will have to sit down and make the decision let my driver get hurt let the other driver get hurt let the bystanders get hurt an irobot model can even be applied where collision avoidance is based on a statistical survival model
213,the answer is simple you hit the child i disagree to a certain extent if its at all possible to avoid the kid i think that would be better eg you could swerve onto a footpath if its empty or use a parked car or guardrail for braking assistance but i would also accept your conclusion because thats probably what a human driver would do panic slam brakes ideally the two sdcs would see the kid approaching the road and talk to each other about the best way to act prior to the event eg hey opposing car a kid is about to jump in front of you i know you cant see it yet but trust me you should brake hard and swerve m to the right im braking and moving to my left to give you space edit i live in a left hand side of the road driving place
214,hey opposing car a kid is about to jump in front of you i know you cant see it yet but trust me you should brake hard and swerve m to the right im really not comfortable with the idea of my car acting on some information sent wirelessly by some untrusted party
215,for the early cities definitely but i imagine there is a point not too far away where they will be confident that their car can handle any new city that has only been pre mapped
216,googles image has taken a big hit in europe with the antitrust breaches and possibly more coming of course he wants to distance them from google
217,waymo employees are not given alphabet shares but are given shares in waymo so would expect waymo to be spun out within a couple of years when that happens alphabet will keep the float pretty small and because of supply and demand the value of waymo will be inflated plus it should be rewarded with sdc hype which is not priced into googgoogl today now how much help googgoogl well last quarter google put up growth and has a forward pe of about so a peg of about using forward pe so would say googgoogl is already significantly undervalued the answer is nobody knows i am old an quit trying to predict how such things will play out in share price instead i look at things that will have strong growth and have faith everything else will work out i believe sdc is a trillion dollar a year opportunity and will take decades to get there so it is about as ideal as you can get for something to fuel growth for a very long time google has now had over growth for the last quarters they will need fuel in a couple of years to keep that going look out years from now when they have b of revenue they will need b of revenue growth so i look at hardware cloud and waymo to get them over b of that then the other b to come from youtube and ads i also believe sdc will be winner take all like other tech things
218,makes sense i also forgot that those caps arent really reliable because of all the rules around how contractors need to be treated differently than employees oh well hopefully waymo is really far along with their driverless tech and ill get to use the service soon by the way it just dawned on me that as a germaphobe if everything turns into ride share i may spend much more of my day uncomfortable
219,i really want to write a full response but i have to run interesting facts million miles driven million miles autonomous vehicles active milesweek they talk a lot about a baseline but never get specific as to what the baseline crash rate is crashes over million miles is miles per crash thats very close to the miles between crashes for drivers in the us i forget if the latter number is reported crashes or estimated all crashes as google says some of their crashes appear small enough that they ordinarily wouldnt get reported that said googles cars all have trained drivers with clean records who are willing to take over and are paid not to get distracted just with that fact alone they should have a slight advantage over the typical driver which includes teens the elderly drunks etc this does discourage over reliance on google and others self reported crash statistics they had said several times that they were only involved in two crashes theyre also still not giving specifics about which crashes were under human control and which were under computer control they dont have to
220,everyone else is secretive thats the problem google are gearing up for commercialization incidents are going to occur often even with a fleet of like every few days at that point i would not blame them they cant trust the media and therefore dont want to add fuel to the fire they are going to be held to much higher standards
221,i wouldnt put much faith in the voxel map first the fact that its being built entirely from fairly low resolution images alone means its accuracy is at least moderately suspect from the beginning again great tech demoits impressive they can even do that much but its not enough when lives are at stake every demo ive seen including greens bears a pretty tenuous connection to the cars actual surroundings i might trust it to keep me away from curbs and other cars but certainly not to avoid a shards of broken glass for instance both the accuracy and spatial resolution are way too low second it doesnt change the ontological problem herethe system simply needs far more contextual understanding and common sense knowledge than it likely has to make intelligent inferences from what it sees whether its pixels voxels or both the system may know a flickering cluster of giant cubes is feet ahead of my bumper but what exactly does that mean is it safe or not this is a question about facts of the worldphysics materials causality etcnot mere geometry third even building a genuinely accurate voxel map would require more ontological awareness than the system appears to have in other words the process is circular just as it is in the human visual cortex we use depth cues to recognize the objects in front of us then use our understanding of those objects to refine and disambiguate those depth cues and repeat the process until we achieve a stable view of our surroundings the process doesnt just go in one direction so feeding in a rough pass of voxel estimation is only a first step many iterative steps remain hence i remain concerned teslas live in a dangerously cartoonish version of reality

223,im certainly not my example was about the long and often detailed instructions written in natural language that are an essential part of many many traffic signs true reliable comprehension is the challenge here not mere digit recognition
224,if we wait until the technology is ready then comes the question how do we know its actually ready what tests do we need what proof is convincing the tech is ready when the public has trust in it that would be acting like a leader in self driving technology and not just as a follower that would be useless actionism and symbolic politics without any merit requiring a driver and a steering wheel does not hold back the industry during research it does not matter needing a back up and when the tech is ready for mass deployment in the general public then you can drop the requirements
225,the tech is ready when the public has trust in it so blind people should wait until the rest of the population that doesnt need self driving cars as much as them has trust in the technology we need empirical proof for the technology to be deployed not a popularity contest
