4.0,t3_un9gxk,"Well depends what we're talking about If we're talking private cars it's definitely not the solution  If we're talking public transport  it does have an impact I'm working in this field trying to test autonomous shuttles in connection with existing connections  
It would make public transport cheaper safer more inclusive and more efficientIt would indeed make jobs disappear but part of them will further exist  just în the office  looking at a few shuttles at a time Also we are studying on demand transport and are trying to have a lead start with this before uber and co so that it stays public At the same time we are trying to see how the gathered data can help us

It's a field worth exploring even if we don't yet know what all the advantages are

5.0,t3_un9gxk,"We don't need self driving cars We need to stop building so many new cars and start teaching people how to properly maintain their current cars 

The fact that EVs are pushed so hard and subsidized instead of putting out PSAs for simple tips on how to maintain a car is ridiculous when we already have so many perfectly good cars available is ridiculous",
6.0,t3_un9gxk,"Unfortunately I think it's precisely consumption that will drive this but not at the end user cars in cities level  Those in the short term will be play things for the people who pay at the upper end of the purchasing spectrum

Instead I expect the self driving will likely be introduced more mainstream in the shipping industry (trucking) to drive down supply chain costs and will focus on first mile (ports factories plants) where the infrastructure can be more controlled to produce less variance for self driving vehicles to deal with  It's a simpler problem to program around controlled environments

Then long haul over interstates (at least in the US) that tend to be more static and predictable  This would let them eliminate trucking jobs and avoid the downtime required by humans  Even if they dropped the max speed they'll probably save on time by allowing them to keep on truckin' through the night

Cities pedestrians passenger commuters and last mile delivery will be the hardest to tackle

18.0,t3_un9gxk,Best case scenario you won’t have to own a car and self driving cars will pick you up and drop you off and some value services could run busses and vans and act in more of a public/carpool way And of course they would be all electric by then The autonomy could also limit the need for stoplights and stop signs which increase range and help ride time,

38.0,t1_i86x6j2,Yes those cars that burn fossil fuels 8 mpg is a pretty extreme example but there are plenty of cars out there without hybrid powertrains that can get over 40 mpg Instead of subsidizing more new cars why not subsidize classes that teach people to properly maintain their existing vehicles and how to drive in ways that'll lower their fuel usage  The amount of people who absolutely gun it when a traffic light turns green just to be the first one to the red light 200 ft away is horrible  There are so many steps society could take that wouldn't require building more cars that we don't need,

44.0,t1_i88x0bl,8 mpg isn’t an extreme example at all You have to realize that only up until the last decade did auto companies start using smaller motors with turbos to increase efficiency and making it the norm Before that a lot of cars had v6 to v8’s which aren’t getting 40 MPG I fully understand your premise but it doesn’t line up with the facts The best selling vehicles for the big 3 are trucks then SUV’s Just maintaining them does nothing to curb carbon emissions I think electric cars are pretty dumb currently as well I personally would love to have a small 2 seat electric vehicle that was affordable but anything like that is expensive or not an option in the Midwest for the winters,

From the article 

> It could be that drivers and passengers can instruct cars to avoid certain destinations Putting aside the question of why we should be imposed upon like this at all if the car were to drive to those verboten destinations anyway that’s probably wrong Recall in Isaac Asimov’s novels that the second law of robotics is to always obey human orders (where they don’t violate the first rule to not cause or allow harm to humans) 

> However resisting humans is a major point of autonomous cars  We humans are often error prone and reckless while algorithms and unblinking sensors can physically drive better than us in most if not all cases An automated vehicle is designed precisely to disregard our orders where they are imminently risky That’s to say refusing human orders is sometimes a feature not a bug It’s unclear then whether opting out of certain destinations (or opting in) is reason enough for cars to comply with those commands

Let’s say we achieve this future where self driving cars are a significant portion of the cars out there and nobody on the planet can deny their efficacy and vast superiority over human drivers

As much as I'd love a self driving car and as much as it would make the roads safer if everybody had one there are lots of people who will never be able to afford a new ""dumb"" car let alone a smart one  The requisite hardware for autonomous driving would not only have to be good and reliable and safe it would also have to get  cheap enough  that it doesn't price entry level buyers out of the new car market and will have to be around long enough that there are plenty of old cheap autonomous cars available for those who can't afford new

At a guess I'd say you'd need to wait about 20 years after autonomous cars became  mainstream  before even thinking about legislation  Even then you'd have to start with merely requiring the feature for new model years like we did for backup cameras a few years ago)  Maybe another decade after that you could start financially disincentivizing human driven cars insurance surcharges and whatnot)  

In the end I don't think you'll ever need to ""ban"" them   they'll just become too old and too expensive for any but hardcore enthusiasts to bother keeping  50 years after AI driving becomes a standard feature cars without the feature will be  50 years old   Think about cars that are 50 years old now  Would you want to drive one every day   They're so old that they're either rusting into the ground or have gone through the ""old and cheap"" phase and come out the other side into the realm of ""expensive classics""  Sooner or later cars without AI will be like cars without fuel injection or ABS or air conditioning  They'll  exist  but they'll all have historic plates and they'll only get driven to car shows",

Unless you're suggesting the government implement a massive trade in so that every American gets one  FOR FREE  But even then that would probably just create a monopoly for whichever company creates the technology first which would also be bad

Also until true AI is a thing even autonomous vehicles will require manual driving for lots of things Rural areas would be particularly hard hit by such a ban since the technology  as it's currently progressing  only works well in urban and suburban environments Anyone who drives long distances on the regular will tell you how often GPS will drop when you're out in the boonies",

This kind of ban is a long time from being enforceable on a practical level though  Like literally decades  We're only now getting to the point where a majority of vehicles have current autonomous safety features lane departure prevention distracted driving warnings etc)  And that's not even fully autonomous

Realistically we're probably 25 years away from the point where most vehicles are fully autonomous  That's the earliest I can see enforcing this kind of legislation And even then it would be more like 'states won't issue registration for vehicles that aren't autonomous' rather than an actual ban  And some people will still try to ignore it because there will always be that segment of the population that arrogantly believes they can drive better than a computer",

The reason I do not think it will happen soon is because for there to be any sense of autonomous driving on the current system of roads there needs to be a minimum uniform code in the algorithm such that cars of different makes can communicate with each other Say for example two cars traveling in opposite directions meet across from each other in an intersection and both want to turn East When humans operate vehicles this is easy because it's just plain human interaction On the other hand if these cars are self driving both cars need to know when where and at what speed the other car is going to make the East turn Why  Because if they don't they will go at the same time and hit each other trying to make the East turn at the same time This is a fundamental problem transitioning to an autonomous transportation system and I don't think private car manufacturers will be open to sharing their autonomous driving code with each other

If there are extra pulses of the same frequency flying around it doesn't improve the resolution or response For example  Car A's sensor sends out a pulse and then listens for a response Let's say that in ideal conditions Car A should hear the return pulse in 20ms However Car B is driving next to Car A and 10ms after A sends out a pulse B sends out a pulse on the same frequency Car A hears this and assumes an object is twice as close as it actually is

Imagine it as if you're listening to music on a stereo and then someone comes in the room with another stereo and starts playing the same song but one measure behind where you are It's going to make things worse for everyone

The answer to your question is that some brain damaged people are very cognizant of how much more functional they used to be I avoid using the word ""smart"" in most contexts as it is too subjective) others are entirely unaware of how much function they've lost and will swear up and down there is nothing wrong with them while they can't remember where they are or what they did 30 seconds ago or perhaps have no ability to walk due to a spinal cord injury received at the same time as the head injury yet will swear they're choosing not to walk because they prefer sitting in the wheelchair  There is no ""one person is one way and another is the other way,"" as brain injured individuals come on a continuum of function ranging from no function whatsoever to so functional nobody can tell they're injured except themselves because they know things are not as easy for them as they once were

190.0,t3_10f5kw,"A good example to look at for this question might be aphasia

There are two primary classical categories of aphasia impairment of speech ability) When people recover from aphasia these correspond to different responses to your question In the one category they respond that they had no idea that their speech was disordered In the other they typically indicate that it was an enormously frustrating experience because they were aware that their speech was not interpretable which strongly suggests that they were able to compare it to their usual functioning in that domain

The problem with this however is that it's effectively impossible to verify since the knowledge you're talking about is inherently internal and subjective The central issue I think is that there's no good way to tease apart someone being cognizant of their prior functionality or being delusionally cognizant of it It's hard to define precisely what it would mean for someone to know how functional they once were Aphasia doesn't solve that problem and I'm somewhat skeptical that it's a possible one to solve

I think it's biggest applications will be as decision support tools in legal & financial settings Perhaps even inform elected reps 

That said I am very skeptical that it can replace them or even get them to change their minds I suspect in practice lobbying and ideology will dictate the stand and then such systems will help collect the arguments to support the stands Even in settings like law the legal firm's clients will determine the lawyers stand and then such a system can help strengthen their arguments

How algorithms & AI affect politics  i) Our views are influenced by the media that algorithms on FB Google & YouTube curate for us Evidence suggests that they show us more content that confirm our views and lock us into echo chambers which in turn creates social fragmentation This is a huge concern i have written more about it here https //wwwwiredcom/2016/11/facebook echo chamber/  It's possible to build algorithms that help diversify our news consumption and there is a lot of effort focused on that today I discuss some of those efforts in my book ii) In 2016 FB replaced human editors with an algo to curate trending news stories The Trending Topics algorithm failed to question the credibility of sources and inadvertently promoted “fake news” The result was that inaccurate and often fabricated stories were widely circulated in the months leading up to the US presidential election According to one estimate the top 20 false stories in that period received greater engagement on Facebook than the top 20 legitimate ones iii) Hypothetical possibilities based on solid research   In 2012 Facebook conducted a study in which they tweaked their newsfeed algorithm to show some users more “hard news” – think more “war in Iraq” and less “cats fitting in boxes” They then measured how many of these users clicked the “I voted” button that most of us saw at the top of our Facebook feed in November 2012 They compared the self reported voter turnout of this group against a control group whose newsfeed algorithm had not been modified The researchers found that users who had their news feed algorithm tweaked increased their voting turnout by three percentage points from 64% for the control group to 67% for the treatment group 3% might not sound like much but the outcomes of elections including the US presidential election in 2016 are frequently determined by smaller amounts

How politics affects AI/algorithms  There are already regulators calling for AI regulation In general the left is asking for greater regulation Some of these proposals are focused on the use of consumer data by firms For example Senator Warren has asked for regulation regarding user data sharing The right is overall asking for fewer regulations And then there bipartisan initiatives such as the one by Senators Klobuchar and Kennedy With regard to algorithms and AI there are some proposals as well How the politics plays out and who gets elected will influence how easily firms are able to roll out new AI",
265.0,t1_eifmxat,"I’m of the view that while individual effort alone will not solve this problem we actually do have some amount of power here and that power is in the form of our knowledge our votes and our dollars

In terms of knowledge the idea is somewhat straightforward but I think it’s under appreciated which is becoming aware of the technologies we’re using and what’s happening behind the scenes with them Instead of being very passive users of technologies and algorithms more deliberate choices should be made We have to ask ourselves how algorithms change the decisions we’re making or that others are making about us

If you look at what Facebook is doing they announced changes to their products  how they’re going to support encryption of messages and support short lived posts that disappear afetr some time) I think that’s a direct outcome of pushback from users

The other is our votes and basically backing representatives who understand the nuances here and who take consumer protection seriously In just the last year or two there have been a number of US Senators and representatives who proposed bills related to privacy and algorithm bias and so on and being aware of who’s doing what in the voting decisions 

And finally with dollars the idea is vote with your wallet We ultimately have the option to walk away from these tools So if we feel like a company is using our data and we don’t find it acceptable for some people that might be where they draw the line and walk away 

All that said I think individual action won't suffice Tech firms have to cooperate and regulators need to push them to do so without going overboard with regulation",

In a future where AI advises politicians and handles problems like optimizing a health care act to provide the highest quality lowest cost care to everyone in a country balancing also perceived sense of fairness from the population politicians really do not have many choices left to make or debate An AI analyzing a court case will one day be able to make a less biased decision than a judge or jury etc By extension democracy and society as we know it would change drastically as AI's reasoning overtakes our own even just for specialized tasks

Imagine it's rush hour and suddenly a rock falls onto the road or something How does that react with human drivers  The first person hits their brakes when they see the rock then person two hits their brakes when they see the brake lights then three when they see person two's brake lights You have several things slowing down this process  driver reaction times mechanical slowness moving the foot to the brake) for multiple drivers In a driverless car scenario the first car would spot the rock and signal to the cars behind them wirelessly) that there is a blockage and they could all slam on their brakes at the same time without having to wait to see brakelights In more extreme cases the cars on either side of the first car could slam on their brakes to make room for the initial car to swerve and avoid the object something that would be impossible for a human to do

On the other hand imagine a red light turning green Car 1 starts rolling then car 2 starts rolling then car 3 etc In a driverless world all the cars would start rolling at the same time In rush hour all the cars could be more tightly packed together because they don't need to leave as much room between cars to account for reaction times

To get back to your question  Driverless cars communicating in eachother and working cooperatively has always been in the plan Wireless communications work on a completely different frequency than lasers and other distances/sonar type measurement tools Wireless networks these days can already hand hundreds and thousands of users so you wouldn't have to worry about the car computers talking over eachother",

Second follow up question regarding computers talking to each other 

I've noticed that most of the wireless routers we employ for personal or business use are on a 24 Ghz 36 or 50 Ghz on the 80211 protocols   and these seem to suffer network dysfunction if too many devices are on the same network 

Would a sea of driverless cars communicating with each other be more likely to use the 80211 or would the manufacturers of the communication system likely implement a separate protocol with a lot of bandwidth strictly for driverless communication  ",
311.0,t1_c6h42m5," In a driverless car scenario the first car would spot the rock and signal to the cars behind them

Cars don't have to be driverless to support this  In fact it would probably be a lot easier to switch to pervasive peer to peer communication of sensor data between cars than to driverless cars

The points about reaction times and mechanical delays are better arguments for driverless cars",
312.0,t1_c6h42m5,"they share the same set of rules they can even predict how other cars will behave  
  
This is most important part  Right now our ability to coordinate with other drivers without being able to communicate is based on humans understanding and following traffic protocols  I don't know exact numbers but I would suspect that upwards of 90% of all traffic ""accidents"" are a result of humans failing to properly follow these protocols   passing on the right going too fast following too closely   etc  At issue is that humans are greedy buggers who are only concerned with personal short term consequences so these protocols are often treated more like suggestions  People generally don't care that rapidly changing lanes without signalling reduces the total throughput of the highway by x% just that they are late to their dentist appointment  Imagine if airline pilots or train conductors thought the same way 
  
Once we eliminate human drivers from the road entirely lots of these issues just go away  A computer will never decide that it is OK to drive slowly in the left lane or roll through a stop sign  It will follow the protocols put into place exactly as they were intended to be followed and traffic fatalities could drop into the hundred or dozens",

There is also the problem of the protocol design; say that 200 cars are in 4 lanes A B C D first cars are A1 B1 C1 D1 seconds are A2 D2 and so on)

How do you have cars relate to each other; I mean how car C13 knows that he’s behind C12 and besides B13  Apparently the protocol would need to have a function that asks “who’s the car besides/in front/behind me ”… Does car D48 really needs to know what B3 is doing 

The sheer number of cars going around all saying “I’m going at such speed” or “I just passed the corner of Hollywood and Vine” or “Hey I get a soft tyre” would likely overwhelm the communication system no matter how terse the protocol is 

And would that protocol be guaranteed or every packet would be like a UDP packet sent and forgotten  In that case the wireless would not be vital for the safe operation so then in the KISS spirit why bother with wireless and only rely on environmental sensing

When it comes to algorithms designed for communications though speed is an important factor Think about mobile cell) phones ok this example is encryption rather than signing but it illustrates the point) if each bit of data was encrypted using a slow algorithm parts of the conversation would soon start to get dropped a slow algorithm would be impracticable There are many algorithms out there and choosing the correct one is often a case of weighing up speed versus the security required for the job at hand More secure algorithms are generally speaking slower

But when I asked him how his future really even made a world safer for cyclists and pedestrians he had no real answer His research didn’t consider noise pollution or that people with self driving cars are more likely to figure out they can just have their car go around the block a few times to get out of parking fees than send it to a cheaper parking garage a few more blocks away than usual That in the world he described it sounded like the streets would become the sole domain of driverless cars That his utopic idea of potential ride sharing with these cars seems antithetical to how the car lobby has operated for decades attempting to get more and more people to buy cars they don’t need He had no real idea of how to really envision self driving car improving a day to day commuter’s experience just the lives of people who already owned cars

And it is unfair that a person whose purview is largely data science to consider elements that likely cannot be quantified by data especially for a future which is largely theoretical already But it’s the fact he hadn’t even seemed to have considered those issues is what aggravates me That he was unaware of other larger socio political forces behind why we live in such a car dominant society today It felt indicative that the spokes people for this future haven’t considered these matters either

Regular drivers are driven by people people with a sense of what they're doing and where they're going being able to see things that may not be on the road react accordingly and can practice self defense driving

People are also extremely likely to make a mistake far more than a computer is to glitch Someone might not be paying attention  not get enough sleep not follow the law or simply not care A computer will never feel the need to make any mistakes and will only ever follow its programming A bug is very unlikely to occur and it doesn't even have to be fatal if it does occur

Problem is unless we were to replace every single vehicle on the road with self driving cars they will never be the investment many believe they are Having to design a computer around the human behavior will never be effective enough to justify the cost Only a full robust system designed around self driving cars will be the safest and effective system

Easy enough right   Should be no problem for a computer to recognize one 

Define red 

You know what red is You learned it by the time you were 4 but what specifically is red 

Computers don't have inherent knowledge of what red is Is red like brick red  Is red like a Ferrari red  How do you empirically define red so a sensor for a computer can tell you what red is 

You could probably tell by measuring the wavelength of the light bouncing off it 

What if the sign is old and faded  Well that's a pink sign now You know it used to be red because you understand that the paint would fade over time You understand that there never were pink stop signs and if you did see one it probably isn't legitimate 

A computer doesn't inherently know that paint fades after decades of UV exposure 

You could expand this exercise for just specifically the red color You could also do this exercise for every other tiny aspect of a stop sign 

Was it hit by a truck  Those sides aren't equal now Did someone put a sticker on it  There are more letters on the sign now Is it snowing  That's just some random white hexagon you have the right of way at this intersection

Some quick definitions 

Reserves  A resource of a known size that can be extracted profitably

Resource  A geologic commodity that exists in both discovered and undiscovered deposits 

We have 14 20 million tonnes of Lithium Reserves

We have 40 50 million tonnes of Lithium Resources

This article goes over some numbers 

https //wwwgreentechmediacom/articles/read/is there enough lithium to maintain the growth of the lithium ion battery m

	In an act of wild speculation let’s suggest that the world will see 100 Tesla size battery production factories by 2040 or hopefully much sooner) This is enough to produce about 100 million EVs per year plus a ton of stationary storage global sales of cars are about 80 million per year so 100 million a year seems about right when we’re including many years of sales in the future with a larger global population) If this is the case and the basic battery requirements don’t change too much the world would need about 800,000 metric tons of lithium by 2040 And that’s just for battery production and doesn’t include the many other uses of lithium  

	The US Geological Survey produced a reserves estimate of lithium in early 2015 concluding that the world has enough known reserves for about 365 years of current global production of about 37,000 tons per year Figure 1) Current production goes to a little over one third for ceramics almost one third for batteries and miscellaneous uses for the last one third The same report finds about 395 million metric tons of “resources,” which is a less firm category than “reserves” ""Resources"" include supplies that could feasibly be extracted economically at some point in the future whereas reserves estimates refer to current economic viability 

	Even though 365 years of reserve supply sounds very comforting the point of the EV and stationary storage revolutions is that current demand will shoot up way up if these revolutions do happen The 100 Gigafactories scenario could come true And if that happens the 365 year supply would be less than a 17 year supply 135 million tons of reserves divided by 800,000 = 169 years)  

	Can lithium batteries scale up  According to this quick and purely speculative math the short answer is with current reserves not just no but hell no With known lithium “resources” at 395 million tons we get about 50 years of supply with 100 Gigafactories which is a bit more comforting but still not exactly a viable long term solution

https //wwwostigov/servlets/purl/1808740

And a reference for lithium recovery rates of these commodities 

	Direct leaching using a HCL solution resulted in less than 10% lithium recovery which was due to nearly 90% of the lithium being associated with insoluble solids as determined by the results from a detailed sequential extraction test 

This is dependent on the type of mineral ore but it’s not uncommon to only be able to extract only 10 30% of a commodity from ore",

And as I have said now 3 times even if lithium were 100% recycled on all lithium batteries in the future this would only help maintain lithium use as it grows It would not offset lithium purchases from growing demand which is what the article I cited discusses It’s not including depleting batteries being replaced over time it’s discussing raw growth of demand from almost a point of zero Even at 100% recycling success it is irrelevant to the point that we don’t have enough lithium to begin with If battery tech moves to some more available resource that’s another matter in itself that is also conjecture Projecting with what technology we have now is the most realistic way to plan around commodity usage

  The centering of pedestrian traffic  Push at least non commercial) automobile traffic out of city centers entirely and perhaps out of cities altogether  Move through traffic around instead of into and put parking only at the edges requiring public transportation cycling walking etc within  It may seem extreme but it's a key to integrating neighborhoods making full use of space increasing freedom of movement and increasing safety by orders of magnitude  And if you think it can't be donewell try visiting the campus of a university that does it  For example UC Davis which is the size of a small city and basically has its own whole little micro economy
  Destruction of suburbs which were literally built in order to isolate people from economic urban centers and force them to travel via car to work shop entertain themselves socialize etc  Create smaller integrated urban centers instead  Having small shops community centers parks etc in former suburbs is an easy change and will only increase the quality of life of those living within and around as it will eliminate a lot of traffic in and out  Check out the proposals of commualists AKA ""social ecologists"") in this regard",

now the development i'm in has some good ideas  it's townhouses which are cool and a whole bunch of people live in a small area so it feels a little livelier than most other places i've lived in and the development itself is pedestrianized and all the buildings are connected by these lovely little walkways but at the same time the nearest businesses are over a mile away in a strip mall that includes a supermarket a salon a smoothie place some other bullshit and the greatest insult of them all  the only ""bar"" within a mile of me is a fucking Taco Bell Cantina which is just a Taco Bell with a liquor license sometimes i feel like getting a drink and then i see that logo and i think ""going in there is sadder than staying sober"" and i just go home instead

growing up i was always on the receiving end of those warnings about drunk driving and i was always like ""well if you're at a place and have some drinks how the fuck else are you supposed to get home  how do bars stay in business if the only way to get home from them is something you can't do after participating in their business model  i have so many questions"" because until i discovered places like this it seemed obvious to me that everywhere you'd ever want to go would be so far away that you wouldn't be able to get there without a car but then i discovered that people in other parts of the world literally live blocks away from y'know music venues and bars and clubs and nice public spaces and other types of good nightlife and can  walk  there and then when they're done getting blitzed or whatever it is they do in places like that they can  stagger home  fuckin' blew my mind the first time i encountered something like that in person

 Those who think that driving big is driving safe or that lightweight fuel efficient vehicles are inherently more dangerous than their heavyweight counterparts need to think again A researcher with Lawrence Berkeley National Lab Berkeley Lab) has teamed with a researcher from the University of Michigan in a unique risk analysis study which shows that contrary to conventional wisdom vehicle quality is a much more important safety factor than weight for the drivers of vehicles involved in a crash

 ""Most cars are safer than the average sports utility vehicle  SUV  while pickup trucks are much less safe than all other types Minivans and import luxury cars have the safest records,"" states the report ""An Analysis of Traffic Deaths by Vehicle Type and Model,"" which was prepared by Tom Wenzel an energy analyst with Berkeley Lab's Environmental Energy Technologies Division and Marc Ross a professor in Michigan's Applied Physics Department

 

 ""A shortcoming of many safety analyses has been that only risks to drivers of a given kind of vehicle are evaluated while the risks imposed on others are ignored,"" says Wenzel ""We focused on the risk not only to occupants of the vehicle model in question in all types of crashes but also on the risk to the drivers of other vehicles involved in crashes with the model in question""

 

 Wenzel and Ross determined that SUVs are no safer for their drivers than the average midsize or large car and not much safer than many of the most popular compact and subcompact car models Drivers of pickup trucks are at even greater risk than drivers of SUVs When the combined risk is considered SUVs and pickup trucks are revealed to be significantly more dangerous than just about any car

 

 ""All the evidence in our study shows that vehicles can be and in fact are being made lighter and more fuel efficient without sacrificing safety,"" says Wenzel ""The argument that lowering the weight of cars to achieve high fuel economy has resulted in excess deaths is unfounded""

 —  Is Bigger Safer  It Ain't Necessarily So (https //www2lblgov/Science Articles/Archive/EETD SUV Safetyhtml) Berkeley Lab

In other words when considering size alone it is the size of the vehicle you collide with that is most important not the size of your own  By driving a big vehicle all you are really doing is increasing the amount of kinetic energy involved in collisions  Which is bad

It's an outgrowth of 

a) being a Logical Positivist

b) believing in causal theories of reference

Roughly   Thoughts in the brain have content

\  Every thought we have and act we perform manipulates those contents

\  There are necessary relations between contents and states of the world such that the world causes us to have contents

\  Reference is the causal mechanism that guarantees this relationship

\  Reference is too ""thin"" to allow us to know which contents are causally related to the world

Regardless of motivation that bypass cut off the neighborhoods to the west of the city from downtown plummeting property values of the homes that  weren’t  destroyed from an era adjusted $150k to a modern $30k city median being $60k) and turning the area into a food desert as most black businesses were in the area that was paved over by the construction project 

Movement of families and loss of property taxes meant that public facilities were less maintained with fewer incentives and finances to maintain them The closing of schools and overgrowth of parks perpetuated the vicious cycle and accelerated the downward spiral Even with a recent beautification project in the area including the commissioning of new affordable housing units to replace abandoned and blighted properties it’s still not exactly an area you want to be in   the wonderful municipal zoo and the city’s only Krispy Kreme location can’t be fully enjoyed because the area is full of desperation and neglect 

And it’s all thanks to cars Or at least cars were the easiest excuse to destroy a large swath of the city either instantly through demolition and construction or through a long and painful starvation that is still ongoing today 

Part of the deconstruction project that started a few years ago will include the reconnection of those isolated neighborhoods to the city center The community that was removed can never be replaced but I hold out hope that the section of the city that was destroyed can regrow and become something special again Besides remaking vital connections the rest of the replacement process is still up in the air   but the prevailing plan seems to be some sort of public space whether a man made forest or an enormous park Whatever it is it’ll be a much better use of 30 acres than the redundant unused highway that strangulated half of the city",

I got back on the bike this year and at first i was struggling so much that i lowered my gearing by replacing the drive gear and now i'm back on the normal drive and very often irritated that i don't have a higher gear  
Like the only reason i can't go above 40 km/h is because i have to spin my legs like a cartoon character  
Given higher gears i would wager that i could reach at least 50 km/h on a slight downhill

Point 5 applies to all animal farming some just take up even more than others Look up trophic levels and you will see You feed animals a lot more than you get out of them in terms of calories That means either growing more crops to feed them than if you ate the crops directly or giving them a lot of land to graze on or a mixture of both All of which result in a lot more land use A tiny percentage of livestock land couldn't be used for anything else

Climate change is point 1 Your claim here is actually about air pollution from arable farming as far as I can tell however that is a fair point that I hadn't considered and is another issue with  intensive  meat production that requires large amounts of cropland to support it I'd say that the answer there is more responsible arable farming to grow those crops though

 Point 4 does apply An animal based diet is more expensive

People aren't spending 29% of their income on meat Your second; I'm not reading one from ""vegan food and living"" that's clearly going to be biased) link also says ""could be"" cheaper But the main difference here is that there is no ""meat dependency"" that is forcing people into that choice   they are  choosing  to spend that extra money because they  like  eating that food

 Point 1 does apply to all 57% of food production greenhouse gases are from animal products while providing nowhere near 57% of the calories

Not being vegan doesn't make you anti science and I haven't claimed that it does Denying those things apply to animal products is though because science tells/shows us that they do apply

By anywhere near 15 million deaths a year  No So point 1 does not apply Since you mentioned the WHO their website says the number might be 35 50,000

So deaths only matter if they are exactly 15 million  You also have to look at indirect deaths through heart disease etc which consuming animal products increases the likelihood/risk of plus PTSD/suicide of slaughterhouse workers etc

Climate change is point 1 Your claim here is actually about air pollution from arable farming as far as I can tell however that is a fair point that I hadn't considered and is another issue with intensive meat production that requires large amounts of cropland to support it I'd say that the answer there is more responsible arable farming to grow those crops though

You can't do it responsibly on a large scale when using such an inefficient food source animal products) though Even if you do it as best as possible for animal products you are still growing multiple times the number of crops you would need to if you didn't consume animal products It's still a big impact

People aren't spending 29% of their income on meat Your second; I'm not reading one from ""vegan food and living"" that's clearly going to be biased) link also says ""could be"" cheaper But the main difference here is that there is no ""meat dependency"" that is forcing people into that choice   they are choosing to spend that extra money because they like eating that food

But that doesn't matter Maybe I worded it weirdly or you are misunderstanding it doesn't matter if the figures are exactly the same the  arguments  the  reasoning  is the same Apologies if I caused the confusion I was trying to say that the arguments are the same I wouldn't say it's meat dependency in the same way as cars but up until a few years ago that would be considered the case Veganism is becoming increasingly easy something it seems like people in this sub wants for cars Just because veganism is further along doesn't mean it isn't comparable I assume you wouldn't abandon your principles regarding cars if other modes of transport become easier  And also the link uses a study it's not just the opinion When directly compared it  is  cheaper than the cheapest meat but it can be a similar price if someone goes expensive on the vegan products Meat is not cheaper than the cheapest plants even calorie for calorie or protein to protein)

And what proportion of that 57% is from intensive farming  You didn't even contest the point I made there

Intensive farming makes up the vast majority of animal products It has to with the amount of people in the world If you are against intensive farming but for the consumption of animal products then you either think that only some people should be allowed them or everyone has to be limited to like 1 portion a week

Veganism is analogous to some ridiculous ""ban all cars immediately and you shouldn't use asphalt roads because they're car products"" position

It's not at all Veganism is against animal abuse Stopping consuming animal products only because of the environment would be your example not veganism

Do I have free will if I do something I have independent reason to do while controlled by the mind control ray No because the reasons that caused the action weren't mine

This also followed a systematic defunding of public transit that crippled low income people's abilities to get around Whether that was orchestrated by the auto industry or just poor planning by cities is up for debate This destruction of urban centers to build parking lots not an exaggeration) followed by building up a lot of low density housing has in many ways exacerbated the housing crisis in addition to leaving cities with poor finances to stay solvent often resulting in federal aid to do basic maintenance

Otherwise happy to help because I'm pretty rusty myself  


Lessee I'm going to make some assumptions so please don't take it as a comment if I go over something you already get because hopefully it'll help us find where things are sticking 

Also feel free to skip anything you don't need  I'm not checking homework 

1  Free will vs Determinism

Compatibilist theories of free will are contrasted with strange I know incompatibilist theories of free will  Incompatibilists say that free will is incompatible with determinism about the material world so that's the big context of the debate  how do you reconcile free will and determinism

2 What is determinism

Determinism is the idea that physical processes are fully caused ie if you know all the preceding steps you can predict the next step  think Laplace's Daemon if you've heard of the thought experiment 

3 What is free will

 One rough way to conceive of Free Will is what's known as Libertarian Free Will which sums up as a kind of ""Could have done otherwise"" Imagine if you could rewind back from a decision  free will is ability after rewinding a choice to make a different one 

4 Why do incompatibilists disagree

Incompatibilists say that either free will or determinism is true  they're  incompatible  with each other  if I rewound my decisions I couldn't choose to do different because every choice is determined ie caused by a previous brain state leading to 2 positions  free will is an illusion or determinism is false

5 Compatibilists

 Compatibilists think both those groups are being overly hasty Dennett's phrase ""Free Will worth having"" is a good way to sum it up  they take the view that incompatibilists have misunderstood their terms and once you fix that misunderstanding there isn't a conflict 

 For the record I have no idea if there are a different bunch of compatibilists who think determinism can be made compatible with traditional conceptions of free will Probably are though it might be interesting to see how you'd do that) 

6 Reasons as casuses

The key insight for compatibilists like me in the Dennett vein there are others but I'm no expert) is that reasons are causal entities  ""The door was causing a draft"" is a reason because it causes me to close my door

7 Free Will Worth Having

Dennett's point is that once you have that insight you realise that actually people's intuitions are that they are at their most free when their actions are fully determined when they are completely caused by reasons 

a) My reason for closing the door is that it was causing a draft

My action closing the door is fully determined by my reason ""it was causing a draft"" 

Contrast 

b) I don't know why I closed the door

We're immediately suspicious Something's gone wrong with my agency 

c) I had no reason to close the door

Similar thing but now you're trying to say that someone else probably did it

And the final charge is that ""free will worth having"" is when every action I take is in fact causally  determined  only not by abstract brain states but the reasons I have for taking that action

The previous examples are teasing out different ways you might use the Dennettian causal story  

1

Do I have free will if someone is controlling me with a mind control ray   
  
No because my actions aren't being caused by my reasons  they're being caused by whatever the properties of the mind control ray are  

This is just a straightforward negative case a version of ""I don't know why I closed the door"" where we get suspicious about whether someone had free will at the time  in this case they just don't 

 2 

 Do I have free will if I do something I have independent reason to do while controlled by the mind control ray     
  
 No because the reasons that caused the action weren't mine 

This is to deal with cases where say someone mind controls me to force me to exercise Yes I had a pretty damn good) reason to exercise but as \ my\  reason didn't cause the action I wasn't free 

This is also the legitimately debateable question about whether paternalism inhibits freedom or simply expresses it 

3

Do I have free will if I do something for reasons that I know I have  Even if those reasons feel like things I have no ""choice"" over   
Yes because the reasons are mine

This is the case of straightforward yes but it also highlights a bigger questions about whether we   ever   actually choose the things we believe  I didn't choose to think cars are an insane way to travel in a city I was forced into that belief by every interaction I have with them and my experience of the roadscape with them on it 

I honestly can't say that I could choose to think otherwise I don't have libertarian free will on this question but I don't think there's anything wrong with that and given the forum here I think you're pretty much in the same boat  


Hopefully you find that all useful though if you don't it might be useful reading some Dennett or listening to one of his many videos on it",

You have regional trains travelling locally that is with a stop at every station even in tiny rural towns I think that's how passenger rail got its start in the first place so some of those regional rail routes are really old like 19th century old) and have earned themselves nicknames that are sometimes printed on the train's livery You use those regional trains if you want to get to or from a small town but they're pretty slow for longer routes Unfortunately if the railway company shuts down unprofitable routes it's usually some of these that get the axe

Then you have regional express rail with the only difference being that they skip most stations So if you want to get from one city to a nearby city or from a smaller place to a city that isn't too far away you use these because they don't have to crawl They're not exactly high speed either but taking them has the advantage of not needing parking or finding your way into or out of a dense urban area in a car

Above those you have Intercity trains meant to connect urban areas that aren't part of the same region They travel faster and skip more stations they're more expensive and offer several price classes a food wagon etc Some important city pairs also have high speed rail connections Intercity Express)

There's also commuter rail S Bahn) connecting cities and their suburbs at generally) higher frequencies than regular regional rail

Out of the three German speaking countries it's probably Switzerland that does it best Rail transport in Germany isn't always that great",

Setting all that aside you have cost A  500 mile flight costs  $300 obviously some variables involved there that could increase or decrease that number The overall home/hotel to home/hotel travel time would be about half as well about 4 for flight to about 8 for car) So the self driving cars would ""cost"" a person +4 hours of travel time on top of their own intrinsic cost An autonomous self driving vehicle driving  500 miles Unless you start putting a decent number of passengers in there as well which means fewer and/or pricier amenities) that ticket is going to be expensive as well

Autopilots can work in the air or even at sea since there is lots of room and little chance for encountering the unexpected They could work well on tracks where forward back and stop are the only three possible commands  But roads are a different matter entirely Kids chase balls into streets animals leap across freeways potholes develop where they shouldn't garbage and debris fall off trucks The world is vast and there is simply no way to create a program that can properly anticipate every hazard properly No programmer or team of programmers is going to be able to anticipate every possible road hazard

&#x200B;

One example I use is this  Imagine you're driving downhill on a mountain pass You're in a standard small sh sedan There is a semi truck behind you loaded down to the gills riding its brakes and downshifting to attempt to slow down on the steep downgrade Suddenly a deer jumps in front of  your car What happens 

A smart person guns it and bounces the damn deer off the hood and accepts that he's going to take some damage doing so A fool or a computer with a forward facing proximity sensor) brakes and the truck then crushes you to death because it physically cannot stop in time no matter what

&#x200B;

Humans are stupid and often make mistakes But at least when a human driver or pilot screws up there is someone to blame A human can also choose ""lessser of two evils"" scenarios when driving   a computer cannot weigh the moral difference between swerving into an oncomming car or running over a child in the road Self driving vehicles are really only viable in known controlled environments Otherwise you're literally putting your life and the lives of those around you in the hands of some programmer who has had way too much Mt Dew way too little sleep and has never seen the terrain you drive in",

565.0,t3_c34ezc,"I can't believe none of the top comments have discussed the number of people moving by plane vs how many vehicles would be on the road if driverless cars were in enough quantity to actually disrupt the airline industry   


173 million people per day are currently flying domestically 27 million total if you include international)  And at most domestically) those are about 4 hour trips coast to coast) or far shorter on average my guess is average flight in the US is about 2 hours but I lack official data)    


So each person is traveling 2 hours to their destination per their day of travel 2 hours on a flight will be conservatively at 350 mph roughly 650 miles very low estimate)    


This 600 hours via car would be 10 hours of driving non stop but of course we need to stop for gas/electric charge or for bathrooms and food  I figure a 10 hour 600 mile trip by car at 60mph average would be closer to 11+ hours    


The low average capacity of commercial flights is 150   
150 people can travel 600 miles in 2 hours using airlines

173 million people can travel 600 miles in 11,533 hours per day

So let's say half the current people flying decide to start traveling via driverless vehicles

1 person can drive 600 miles in 11 hours

150 people can drive 600 miles in 90,000 hours  

860,000 people can drive 600 miles in 9,460,000 hours per day

&#x200B;

Now imagine traffic is increase by 860,000 people increasing main freeway/interstate travel congestion by over 9 million hours per day spread out across the 48 states)  

  
I can't fathom this ever making a dent in airline travel because enough people realistically switched to driverless cars on average we'd see significant increase in travel times traffic congestion etc

How long are they at the airport 

Well there is the drive to the airport you are supposed to arrive a certain amount of time before your flight you have to go through security get your bags through taxi and then the flight maybe takes 35 50 minutes then you have to land taxi wait for your bags and then figure out transportation at your destination and these flights if booked in advance can be in the $200 range but if booked closer can be $500 or so And that's still about a 4 hour experience if you get to the airport 2 hours before your flight leaves as is recommended

&#x200B;

Total time difference isn't much at all

You solve the issue of transportation at your location no rental car or figuring out public transport or paying ubers)

Your cost is much lower

You don't risk losing your bags

You don't have to hassle with security and TSA

You can tell the car to stop at any restaurant you want for food to eat on the go

You get to stay in your own car which is probably more comfortable to you than coach/economy class on the plane

The self driving car is going to decimate short haul flights Anything shorter than a 5 6 hour drive that might previously have justified a plane especially for business travel) is going to be a much harder sell compared to a self driving car A lot of those short hopper flights where newer pilots typically gain experience before being allowed to do longer flights will fall in popularity The airlines will have to make a major shift in business model for those flights if they are to survive either by cutting prices on shorter flights offering more services or making them more enjoyable Similar to how many movie theatres have moved to offering cooked meals interactive events and alcohol to compete with the home theatre

In addition by the time fully driving cars hit the streets they are likely to be fully electric This would drastically reduce the carbon footprint

Another problem is that research so far indicates that the overwhelming majority of the public wants these cars   they just don’t want to pay the price with their own lives when someone else could take the fall It’s a catch 22 that will take government intervention to solve because the automotive industry simply catering to consumer demand could create the scenario that the more you pay the more safety features are added to the car to protect you the passenger over everyone else My thesis in a nutshell) It still needs quite a bit of work but this is possibly the most relevant modern day take on utilitarian principles yet

2064.0,t1_dwiazj0,"Self driving cars will really completely change how we deal with car insurance What might end up happening is people buy insurance for their autonomous car and if an accident does happen insurance pays for it and life goes on Nobody is charged more since the risk of that particular car getting into another accident is not increased; it stayed the same Relative to every other autonomous car on the road that particular car’s risk of getting into another accident has not changed since every car would ideally have the same programming 

We’re still thinking of insurance in terms of who to blame in an accident but when autonomous cars come around they aren’t going to be making the same mistakes as human drivers If an accident does happen it’s almost 100% of the time going to be due to something out of the control of any one car The simplest way to handle insuring a vehicle that simply cannot have at fault accidents is just to pay a flat rate and when an accident does happen insurance pays for the damages for that particular car and moves on If there were multiple vehicles involved each vehicles insurance will pay for the damage on their particular vehicle 

Now if an accident does happen that is at the fault of the car’s programming that should be up to the software developer to deal with If a glitch in the car’s programming causes the accident that developer is responsible for their own software 

If an accident occurred due to a poorly maintained vehicle that is the responsibility of the vehicles owner to deal with In that case their insurance provider could decide to raise their premiums because they have proven that they don’t maintain their vehicle or they could require regular inspections or something like that ",

Further that sort of utilitarian logic isn't how virtually any society on earth runs or has ever runs If it was we'd obtain blood and organ donations by force when necessary We'd ban individual cars and only allow public transit We'd ration and distribute resources in essentially the polar opposite way we currently do For all we know a hypothetical society based on that principle isn't even viable

But instead we as a species spend literally centuries discussing the things that are arguably more important than any 1 person's life Like freedom of choice and bodily autonomy Like whether or not an action that results in positive outcomes is inherently just and if not is an unjust action that has a positive outcome permissible or not Are protecting abstract concepts like justice and equality and freedom more important than saving lives etc

2108.0,t1_dwirr6l,"I've been hit as a pedestrian 3 times once while still on the footpath The other two times was at an intersection with lights as I crossed with the pedestrian indicator

I agree that as a pedestrian it's important that you still look both ways crossings and traffic lights with pedestrians signals aren't ""cross whenever"" they're ""you have right of way cross when safe""

I have seen pedestrians step out on zebra crossings knowing cars have to stop but they don't physically give nearby cars enough time to stop

That said I have a visual impairment and while I did look before I crossed I unfortunately missed the car that was barrelling up the parking lane because my brain doesn't really see movement well and I assumed when I saw a car in the parking lane it was well parked he was speeding and in the wrong lane but I did step in front of him without enough time for him to stop I believe that if I wasn't visually impaired I would have avoided that accident So that's  kinda  on me but also completely the drivers fault for driving in the wrong lane and planning to run the red light 

The other intersection was completely the drivers fault I was halfway across the road when the driver looked up from his phone saw a green light and just started driving off The green light was for trams not cars Pedestrians cyclists and trams had a green signal cars and buses still had red 

The other time I was walking down the footpath on a small inner city commercial street and a car that was stuck in jammed traffic just randomly pulled to the left to try and get into the parking lane to cut traffic off but he was overzealous and mounted the curb straight into me thankfully the curb took most of the momentum out of the car so I was just knocked over 

Thankfully the only injuries have been bruising and joint dislocations Which I'm prone to anyway) 

The annoying thing is the complete lack of self awareness so many drivers seem to have at their incompetence I can actually legally drive if I want Despite my neurological issues with vision I can pass motor department eye exams because they don't test depth perception or movement tracking just ""can you read text from a few metres away""

In my opinion I would completely rid of the waiting period just more time you can't protect yourself Extensive background checks and anyone with even a single account of a violent history or any sort of mental instability including certain prescription drugs) should be barred from buying guns until deemed mentally fit if ever Spending more time at ranges can aid those looking to protect themselves if anything going to a range less means you'll be less acquainted with the tool that may save your or your loved one's lives

The biggest issue is the fact that people advocate banning guns without looking up statistics It's a twitch trigger response to the massively and purposefully) wide spread coverage on the recent shootings

Second issue which is the only reason there will never be a full gun ban in the US is because in general the American people aren't stupid enough to hand over their only line of defense between them and their government which is armed to the teeth A demand on a full gun ban will be met with blood in the streets and rightfully so

Before you dismiss the tyrannical government gone rogue possibility if you even do I don't know) remember what happened to the Jews in Poland during WWII and the fact the powers that be are so desperately trying to disarm the people is worrying and gun owners know exactly what's going on

Besides which this tech 100% will not become as common as quickly as Elon Musk and others think Until it can cycle into the secondary market in very large numbers for over a decade while still being safely usable it won’t replace the 10 20 year old Hondas and Toyotas and old ford pickups on the road So “it will be all automated vehicles so road conditions will be less chaotic” is blatant nonsense Maybe in 50 years    Maybe    If wealth inequality lessens as well in that time ",

The autopilot does a fantastic job of holding altitude and heading It does zero decision making which is what the pilots are there for

What this means is that we would be landing with a tailwind This isn’t the end of the world in most situations if the winds are light enough and the runway is long enough however in this situation the gust factor of 15 knots was past our maximum tailwind component of 10 knots Even though the visibility and ceilings were VFR we could land visually from cruise without needing an approach) we had no choice but to divert

I think we will transition from owning cars to 'streaming' them to use a modern paradigm)

Imagine you pay a subscription fee to a auto drive service which has a massive selection of specialist cars You can set up a regular commute so a car will be at your door ready for when you want to set off and can ad hoc request a car any time you want

The benefits  Literally billions of dollars worth of parking real estate is freed up Every major venue needs massive amounts of parking if everyone had auto drives this could be eliminated overnight This would fundamentally change how large venues are constructed   all they'd need are massive drop off areas Every residential home can convert their garage to another room   house values increase

Now think about the auto drive service you think they're going to build cars with 5 seats all facing forward  No

If you're travelling alone a single seater in the middle ultra comfy If you pay enough have a 'gaming' car show up complete with consoles/PC and high speed internet Commuting for work  Work station car Commuting overnight  Bed car 

People will immediately try to 'gotcha' this idea by saying stuff like ""yeah sounds good until your morning car shows up with vomit in it"" Yes this will happen on the cheaper services You'll also have situations where on cheaper services there isn't an ad hoc car available It'll run by capitalist rules if you pay for a cheaper less renowned service you'll get worse service like flying Ryan Air you know what you're paying for

Ultimately though the cheapest service will open up most of the freedom and economic liberty to the poorest who have never been able to afford a car or lessons And people who currently have the means to own and run a car which is crazy expensive) will probably pay about half as much as they do now for a top end service with all the bells and whistles

Honestly I can't see the future going any other way only millionaires will own a personal self drive because what's the damn point in owning one 

Oh and other benefits  You never have to defrost your car You never have to worry about maintenance You never have to get an MOT You never have to change a tire You never have to gas it up You never have to park it You never have to wait for it to warm up in the mornings

I would work all day Friday hop in the car and play games and then crash and wake up in New Orleans or Chicago or Florida for the weekend

Come Sunday when we're done partying hop back in the car and sleep and be home in time for Monday morning

Bonus points for these cars being electric and the Doctor Octopus Tesla chargers being standard so it wouldn't even cost anything and it would stop and recharge and then take off again all on its own

Not to mention the first person to create an affordable luxury electric RV with solar roof and self driving will be a gazillionaire  So many people would happily give up their home for a nice RV and live life on the road with a vehicle that doubles as a home and costs nearly nothing to upkeep and allows them to visit anywhere they want and live there on a whim

Unfortunately a car with car seats pre installed may sound like the solution BUT each child needs their own configuration to fit the seat properly and in the right direction All seats would need to be the same so parents know how to use it properly each brand has their own gimmick or special thing which is a pain in the ass) And each family has a different number of kids with varying ages This is the majority of our population And then there's special needs children with even more specialized seats 

Cars are designed around the safety of adults Car seats ""adapt"" children to the safety features  because their little bodies cannot withstand crash forces nor fit a standard seat belt without one Until cars are designed for infants and children car seats will always be needed And our hopes of a fully autonomous vehicle world with be burdened with this issue

Functionally people love to personalize stuff Who wants to use a shared workstation when you can set up your own exact monitor/computer/chair/etc  Who wants to use a shared bed  The more the car moves from a point A to B movement tool and a mobile bedroom/office the more incentive there is to customize it decorate it whatever In your model the high end options would also need an additional stop between rentals to go to a cleaning/maid service stop to tidy up another cost over just using your own 

If you own it all the car needs to do is drive back home or to a closeish automatic parking garage and wait to pick you up With shared there will be less parking needed overall but load balancing is always an issue anyway The commute rush into a city won’t have enough traffic leaving after they arrive to use all those cars and those cars all need to return to the city at the evening rush hour anyway to pick up there commuter 

Trends that I predict happen 
 Longer commutes and more suburban sprawl With automated driving long commutes are less of an issue since you can work/sleep/relax so the longer commute to cheaper cost of living area balance gets shifted further out 
 Move to larger vehicles As electric grows larger vehicles will have better acceleration than they do now and with automatic recharging the reduced range is a smaller factor Self driving cars can implement close follow distance reducing the issues with bulky vehicles further The larger vehicle will give your “mobile bedroom” more space to fit whatever you want

First passenger calls the thing up gets in sets the destination but then if someone along the route is going the same general direction they get picked up along the way 

Or maybe people who live in the same area who call up a ride are put into a lobby that could be filled and the ride takes them to their destinations individually so long as those destinations are reasonably close to one another

Err just FYI   this is not necessarily a good thing   The way people handle maintenance right now is inconvenient sure but at least gives the consumer more power in this equation

Moving to a subscription based service you ARE going to be paying for maintenance for tire changes for gas and other wear and tear items on a vehicle but that's just going to be part of your fee The kicker here is that you no longer get to decide HOW they decide to perform their maintenance and with what parts Companies down the value chain will start to charge premiums for their parts and the subscription service companies/fleet owners will pass that cost onto the end user tacked on with their own hidden fees to create extra revenue 

Sure capitalism might dictate that competition will weed out any extraneous price gouging from the companies but in practice we as a society move closer and closer to consolidation and tech monopolies as time progresses 

You can argue that the cost savings from other benefits will cancel this out initially and that may be true But down the line this is going to be another part of the equation that is out of the consumers hands You have noted some tangible benefits but I don't have faith that the end user will win in this specific regard",

But one thing I’d like to point out in relation to vomiting in the car leaving trash causing damage etc) is that when you’re a member of one of these car services you will have an account rating just like on Uber/Lyft So if you vomit in a car you’ll probably be fine as long as you report it and the car will go in for maintenance rather than continuing in circulation If you don’t and the car picks someone else up with vomit in it they’ll report it and you’ll get a strike on your account After enough strikes you’ll either be banned or have to pay for a more expensive probation package that is checked by maintenance on a per user basis Likewise you’ll probably also be more likely to be paired with cars from other people with strikes on their account so that customers with clean records are less likely to end up with those cars

3215.0,t1_erdwyoi,That exists it called taxis the only difference is that you are replacing the driver with a computer Also since the cheapest version would probably try to maximize profits by picking up multiple people at set locations and dropping them off at other set locations that is just bus/trolley Your idea is to automate taxis/buses and then to attract rich people who like their fancy cars have autocars with luxury services The automation process for taxis and buses has already started,
3216.0,t1_erdwyoi,"Some questions 

1 Where will all the cars go when they’re not in use 

As you probably know car use is a bell curve with highest utilization rates around morning 8am ish)and evening 5pm ish) So when the United States needs 50 million cars on the road at 8am we’ll still have rush hour traffic  but where will those cars all go during off peak times if there are no longer parking lots 

2 People still need garages 

Maybe we’ll have smaller ones but you need a place for bikes scooters maybe storage or an easy way to bring groceries into the house Maybe this will transform somehow but I’m guessing people will still like garages in the future and houses without any garage will still be less desirable 

3 With more cars on the road roads will become more congested 

I know self driving will likely allow more throughput and hence more cars on the road at a time but with cars going all over a city like taxi’s or buses in NYC) I think this would clog up the streets making the idea of “living closer in” still desirable  There could be close to double the cars on the road as for every mile a car drives with a passenger it needs to travel back from the commercial districts to the residential districts empty 

4 Streaming a car won’t be that much cheaper than a taxi is today at least in big cities) 

Taxi drivers for example are often immigrants and actually make about minimum wage So maybe half of the cost of the fare goes to the driver The other half goes to maintenance gas credit card processing insurance depreciation or rental of the vehicle etc To replace a minimum wage driver can take expensive tech Obviously self driving will be cheaper but not dramatically cheaper Maybe 2/3 of the price of a taxi would be my guess It will certainly not be 1/2 the cost of owning a car that’s for sure  

5 Poorer people will continue to prefer public transport such as busses and subways  This doesn’t displace that  The streaming service you describe will be a premium service to start with 

As for people that are just wealthy enough to buy a car owning a car can be as cheap as $2k per year plus all the other additional costs like gas and maintenance being the primary two that don’t really decrease per mile driven and could increase slightly Also without parking lots vehicles need to use more gas and will have more “wear and tear” to get back to its base or docking station So a new Kia that leases for $160 per month today would cost more if self driving tech were added  In addition to self driving tech the vehicle would need to have better communication tech and there would need to be a backbone of maintenance guys to change tires or fix various issues that can happen And a used Kia would cost even less I can’t do the exact math on this because it is too complicated but overall I’m not saying it will be a little cheaper in some situations but it won’t necessarily be that much cheaper",

3391.0,t1_erdyahj,"Worked in Insurance for 15 years made it to lower) senior management in two global corporations and have a Diploma in Insurance really I’m a totally interesting and swell guy who absolutely didn’t own several different shades of grey suit honest) I’m going to say on this one that I disagree An insurance company is in the business of lowering risk exposure against premium charged in order to increase their profit margin Essentially the less they have to pay out the better Sometimes they do this with good advice to the customer based on their knowledge of what likely causes of loss are Particularly type of door lock or burglar alarm works better  They will advise you fit it and can lower your premium accordingly They know with those you’re less likely to have a loss and they get to keep more premium across the pool of risks they insure every year


Anyway Currently to insure a car they have to assess individual driver’s ability lifestyle carelessness decision making skills location commute type of parking level of car usage type of use and experience Some they can ask you some they can use big data to figure the trends But in a lot of cases they simply can’t know as much about you as you know about you so their premium charged has to guess and factor that in I worked on multiple books of motor insurance that had a Combined Operating Ratio money in verses money out) of over 100% You need less than 100% to be making money And these were the big insurance companies with the really good systems low operating costs internal efficiencies and damn good actuaries In the UK the motor industry lost money every year for over a decade   I don’t know the stats these daysThey’d make up for it in other areas


For an Insurance company where in the UK it is compulsory for a driver to have at least Third Party liability to cover you damaging other things or people) there’s simply a lot of stuff that you the driver could do that they can’t account for in their numbers but will have to pay for if you screwed up


But an automatic car  Not owned by an individual but by company trying to run a profit themselves  With known software and hardware combinations  Known and predictable use cases secure storage facilities regular maintenance and user feedback reporting  And a large data set provided by the company themselves that reports all incidents and not just the ones that the drivers do actually report  That’s going to lead to a much more predictable loss data set and you have a company to sue when it goes wrong Suing a regular person for the money they don’t have can be a hiding to nothing


So the way I see it insurance companies can’t wait to get their hands on the business model of automated drive and fleet / pool car operations where the unknown human element is a much more manageable In the insurance press it’s been a topic of discussion for years with some people actually thinking the biggest resistance wont come from the insurance companies but from the population resisting having their ‘freedom to drive’ ‘taken away’ from them and from governments that will be slow to unpack the current insurance legislation and open it up to allow innovation in the market


The insurance companies want more money for their shareholders They often do it by slicing the back end operation which I in operations hated them for It made people their own staff have worse quality lives all so the shareholders could benefit Paying less in claims is a much much more lucrative option and may even stop them for a while) from carving into themselves for the extra cash  I think they want the automation They won’t resist it It’s way too much good money",

So firstly why would they clog the streets  You'd have less cars per person So existing parking spaces would free up or could simply be used to 'store' the car until a job becomes available

Another option is orbiting the busiest city/area Link this in with internet communication and a company can live track where the traffic is and orbit in different areas Or if one car pulls out of a parking spot another can take its place immediately

In the longer term computers and data mining can begin to predict how many cars are required in certain areas in certain times and simply drive away into the country side or into custom built 'banks' to recharge and be cleaned during down hours like 9 12 and 1 5)

This sort of thing happens in the UK with the power grid when it's half time at the World Cup we have to spin up more generators because everyone puts the kettle on at the same time and causes a huge surge

I think the same sort of logic will apply here It won't matter what the human condition is if the market forces provide a better alternative 

Also as for the ""I own this car"" feeling I wonder how much customization you could offer 

Just spit balling but the human brain is exceptionally dumb and can be tricked easily

Imagine if you have a bunch of LED panels and pictures on the car which are hot swappable You go into an app and set the car colour logos maybe even the license plate then as it rounds the corner to pick you up it flips and pulls up looking like ""your"" car Nobody else has one in this specific colour with your favorite characters on it Your brain accepts it as ""your"" car you'll never see an exact copy driving around and it won't feel ""generic"" or just be a bland grey

They aren't going to put themselves in those situations nearly as much they've got 100x better reaction speeds can see 10x further and eventually will be able to communicate with other cars on the road as well

There will come a time when a car will jerk hard to the right in the middle of highway traffic because someone just jumped off or threw something off the overpass  And as it swerves into the other lane that lane is already clear because the car that was occupying that space got the message and itself slowed down and swerved to make room for your car avoiding it

And all the cars for 1000 feet behind it also adapt their paths and suddenly start navigating around the obstacle or person in the road while automatically alerting EMS or police the exact location with a picture of what's happening

 Car usage isn't consistent throughout the day so when demand drops ask the automated cars will still need a place to park

miles out of town in custom built lots 

ideally near where the next peaks in demand will be probably right by where they just dropped off)

Why 

Because people hate to wait


What's stopping a computer from figuring all of this out and making the car arrive just in time 

Because aside from sporting events people are notoriously difficult to predict This isn't simple pattern recognition it's both micro  individual) and macro  crowd) predictions you're talking about


And to be specific I mean in big city centers probably more so in Europe) London for example house prices are so enormous that if you could turn your garage into another room that's worth literally £150'000

I also live in an expensive city Runs about $1,000/sqft right now appreciating at 1%  per month  and there are two more expensive cities right next door Having a garage even one that is falling down adds $300k to the property's value $500k if it's in good repair) because you're not allowed to build them more often than not not unless it's ""pre existing"" The UK is also vastly different than the USA in terms of car usage It's not uncommon to commute more than 40 miles a day to get to work even 60 80 or more isn't in heard of Hell one of my coworkers drives over 150 miles and crosses state lines each day 

You simply won't reclaim as much real estate as you think they will because you will never build a system to anticipates every single rider as well as the total 'crowd' of riders and their demand for when they needs transportation Uber works because it's generally short hops around a city not daily commuting in and out of a city There is a reason why the costs sky rockets the second you order a ride to or from the suburbs their charging you got the cost of the return trip to the city",

Personally I'd rather have a self driving car that I own 100% Over time and especially depending on the fees of such a service buying a car could be more cost effective Based on my car payments I currently pay $12 per day towards paying off my car Another $10 12 on gas per day Then maintenance if broken down per day is maybe a lot less Let's say $3 per day So basically I pay roughly $30 per day for my car Once car payments stop and I fully own it that number is halved I won't count insurance or tolls as that may not be a huge concern in the self driving future

My question is how much would a subscription car service cost  I know a train ticket from my house to New York City near where I work is $32 per day though monthly passes are available for $425  $14 per day) So assuming a self driving car service exists it will probably be more than a train fare due to the convenience factor but must be less than a car payment + gas Let's say $20 25 per day Not bad but I still think the convenience of accessing my stuff outweighs the cost of renting a car every day and I think that's why a lot of people drive rather than take public transportation",

And now instead of parking in the city and “finishing” the trip an hour sooner those cars need to be sent “out to the country” to park More car miles consumed each day means more traffic And now instead of current parking lots being “idle space” they will have new buildings with people needing access to them So we doubled the population density of the city generating even more car miles of demand for the same roads Inefficient and wasteful if not “convenient”   the story of environmental collapse",

So initially they'd cannibalize the existing transport system or are you going to try to claim buses and taxis don't have a business from 9 5 Monday to Friday 

I'm claiming that if taxis were cheaper than owning more people would already use a taxi   The reason Uber has surge pricing is because taxis don't work when everyone needs a car at the same time   

It's really a non issue You're not renting it out to strangers and the company who is leasing it would provide protections

Your transition scenario is renting to strangers   No economic compensation fixes this   You getting a different car from your vomited car that someone else vomited in a month earlier but was cleaned out by the leasing company before sending it to you doesn't help

The problem solves itself through the free market

No the free market converges to our current system because people already have chosen not to use rental cars or taxis

Sorry are you saying the subscription service will be more expensive than owning the car 

It has to be   The only way a commute without carpooling works is if everyone has a car   That means the rental company has to buy a car for everyone 

 Uber and taxis already shows the total market for ride sharing  To use NYC data there are about 80k ""streamers"" fully saturating the market of 8 million people  That's 1% at best because NYC isn't as dependant on commuters as other cities

So a streaming service at best has to buy 99 cars that won't make a profit or each of the hundred cars makes 1% profit  same thing)    1 self driving taxi can't pay the lease payments for 99 cars  That means a streaming company would have to charge more for a car rental to make a profit compared to you buying your own car

If it's not cheaper than ownership it is completely not viable

Exactly  It's not viable   It's the reason people buy rather than Uber or rent

Self Driving cars are tier one disruptive technology the likes of which we haven't seen since the Dot Com Boom  Many towns  only exist  because they get a stable stream of money through their truck stops

There are 35 million professional truck drivers in the US  With roughly 166 million in the workforce this alone threatens to almost overnight increase unemployment by 21% or in other words it would go from 49% to 70%)

But if anything that understates it  An additional 55 work in the commercial shipping industry whose jobs are also at risk along with a large number of taxi and bus drivers  Millions of small time businesses depend on commercial shipping and the humans doing it) to sustain themselves  EMTs police and other emergency workers would see decreased demand along with insurance workers

We often talk about jobs being displaced by technology but usually that hasn't been the case  When horseless carriages showed up buggy driving as a career went away but new jobs popped up  But this represents a rare tangible threat that will end jobs without the potential for new growth

Overall self driving cars are a huge net positive but like globalization it comes with large localized downsides that require vision and leadership to overcome  A proper redistribution system would smooth out the peaks and valleys of both mitigating most of the problems they create

I mean literally That's what ""donnation"" means I don't need it anymore

The general idea was we have unneccesary deaths 2 people die One from a gunshot wound to the head the other one from a missing liver translant Lets cut that short by taking the otherwise still useable gunshot victims liver and sowing it into the other patients body We can save one of them guaranteed 

The idea was never we have a right to those organ numbers We have a right to now demand those organs The idea was never we now get to complain because large numbers of organs are not there where we need them 

The general idea is innovate your way out of this 

For example allow some donors to decide for themself how their organs will be used For example I myself would have no problems with my organs being donnated to a poor schlob who never won anything To specify that if my reccipient has plans like climb mount everrest ride the bike or have an active and healthy social life go tell him to fck himself and prioritise the bottom of the list these people whom you wouldn't trust with a fresh vegan liver give them my liver Put a smile on their faces Shit on the guy who plans to run with the bulls or who has an instagramm account donnate your heart to the bottom of the transplant waiting list your liver to an recovering alcoholic your skin to someone who looks like a two and otherwise would need skingrafts from their own ass and your dick to someone who put ""chronic masturbation"" under ""hobbies"" Let my shit go to people who actually appreciate it not take it for granted I could see a lot of people out of their free will donnating their organs and actually feeling good about it Skin blood liver shit I take it like with the Computer if anything can be reused before you toss it into the biohazard bin and burry it in an abandoned mineshaft be my gust grab what you need to when it is clear that I don't need it anymore Just don't give it to the prick with the hope and stars in their eyes give it to themiserable bastard that has never won anything and make them for once feel like they own the world The downside would be that you would actually have to respect those wishes and such You know I will not be around to check anymore but I am sure it would be a hoot to tell mister schmidt from 3b that the medical board has a heart for him even though the medical board can't legally give that heart to anyone else But too often when a board decides who gets the organs and who gets a second chance I wanna wipe the smug grins off of their faces and go yea she ugly as fuck but she's a two so the /r/meistermalkav clause grips and she gets his skin Yes all of it see what she needs cut off the rest make a trendy bag out of it And this is where I see the problem The doctors would never agree to actually respect the donors wishes and hand over their power they would allways push for this little bit of extra of finger waving of such And of course there would be the 1  the people that go I want my body parts to go to someone who is white I know it is harsh but better then publically whining about how fewer transplants we will have because more and more people will surive would be to take the good with the bad Just increase the numbers Every racist bastard who gets his wish means one fewer place on that list needing to be filled 

An other option would be medically assisted suicide I am dead serious on that one If all you care is get places of of that list go fuck your ethics board untill they bleed from both ends and offer assisted suicide have a suicide coaster in the back that kills you in a painless safe and guaranteed way in exchange for the right to harvest the organs Of course respect these peoples wishes what they want to be done with the organs and the grafts but in the end if you are good enough to whine publically about the list let me remind you that if you pushed for harvesting rights to suicide victims bodies your numbers would look quite different Yes there would be the option about ""not doing harm"" but that could be done with a patient activated mechanism

Use what you can from my body and go fuck your ethics board If you can get it out of my body without retching uncontrollably you are entitled to have it If any of my body ends up in an art project go buy a big pack of smokes for the nearest smoker and tell him my story

It's the same reason that people who have no problem driving a car on an 80 mile an hour highway where they know full well that they have a better chance of being killed than in a plane crash are terrified of flying and it's for a good reason It's not some irrational thought process that goes on in the human mind    it's about being in control of one's own physical well being which is a right by default It goes hand in hand with the proverb of ""those who are willing to give up a little freedom for a little security deserve neither and will receive none""

I heard this concept recently here on reddit  I believe this process is active in one or more countries  You do not HAVE to be an organ donor you simply notify the proper agency and you are removed

For myself when I was younger I did not do it because I did not care that much as I was young and death and suffering of others had not really affected my life so it was not in my mind  I also didn't put a lot of thought into how I felt about it  I pretty much just skipped over it without much thought  I know that if I had automatically been made one by the state I most likely would not have bothered to ever remove it  Now I am one because I have seen what it can do for people and I think about others who may lose loved ones because I didn't sign up for something that I really had no religious or serious personal feelings about

In fact the very nature of the terminology you use an ""accidental death"" ie a death without human fault due to lack of intent or human action or in a more general sense a life already forfeit to statistics) implies a distance morally speaking) from the action We don't have a moral obligation to protect against accidental deaths due to say meteor strikes because there is no one to fault for the meteor's action Once the means is available to alter the statistic of ""accidents"" such as reducing accidental cancer deaths by reducing radioactive emissions by reducing coal consumption or reducing accidental starvation by planting of dwarf wheat) the decision to implement or not to implement that policy or technology becomes a moral decision with very real ""blood"" in the balance even though ""not taking any action"" was an amoral position to have before such means were available It is no longer a balance between ""action"" and ""accident""

The way we treat fault and intent leads to irrational behavior like overconsumption exploitation ignoring genocides improper alignment of prison goals and outcomes etc

Next,

While I agree I think it's important to note that people are still potentially going to die

One might consider both the quality and longevity of life of a person who doesn't die due to stopping very quickly and maybe being asked to occupy too small a volume) versus someone who doesn't die because a failing organ has been replaced In that case one might consider a single life saved from a driving accident to be better than one life saved via an organ transplant In fact I would bet that some more in depth accounting regarding average expectations for personal achievement personal utility) social enrichment utility derived through human interaction) economic achievement both from creation and consumption) and familial achievement having a spouse and children) combined with the probably longer lifespan of a healthy person who doesn't die would mean that an objective observer would probably find it reasonable to prioritize  several  ""prevented deaths"" over one person saved via an organ transplant We can also consider the fraction of accident victims whose organs are compatible with a donor available within range of a suitable donor and which survive the transport and implantation procedure I don't think there's any basis for any equivalence between the death of a car accident victim and the death of a person who doesn't receive an organ transplant

 edit  in this analysis I was basing my assumptions on major organ donations and probably some stereotypical bias of organ recipients that's probably not true although I was considering the consequences of a healthy individual versus someone living on immunosuppressants for the rest of their life and the potential for better immunosuppressants or some alternative therapy becoming available later in the organ recipient's life) I'm open to any debate on these presumptions but my overall point is that the weighting of societal benefit to the organ recipient versus the crash victim is more than a 1 1 or 1 8 depending on how many lives get saved from one person's organs) direct equivalence I'm entirely open to the possibility that such accounting would tell us that killing people in car crashes and harvesting their organs is  better  for society than taking action to reduce car crashes At that point we end up with arguments of personal liberty etc I believe my original point that choosing whether or not to take action eg preventing people who need organ transplants from dying by banning the use of self driving cars is still a moral decision   I think not taking an action becomes a moral decision once an action is available that alters the outcome of whatever is in question so categorizing something as ""preventing accidents"" versus ""saving lives"" becomes a false difference ",

However if it became opt out there would be next to no incentive whatsoever to inform people of their right to do that £0/year would be spent telling people of their rights

I  am  a donor I'm not religious I don't believe in a soul or any of that shit   but   I still think it's quite fundamentally morally wrong to not have each and every individual knowingly choose what happens after they go rather than creating an incentive for the state to keep people ignorant of it

Medically organ transplants would rarely occur from traumatic injuries   Usually injuries that severe that are traumatic simply result in death because they can't be repaired in time  Organ transplants require an extensive search for compatability and have long wait listsThey require lengthy immunosuppressive treatment and lots of follow up It's pretty rare that there's a traumatic injury but the patient is stable long enough to source a replacement organ conduct the transplant and do follow up to see if it works 

There may be a rather large exception where this concerns orthopedic surgeries but those are very very different  For example if you have a badly mangled arm or leg you may get grafted tendons and bones as part of reconstructive surgery but those can be stored for up to 5 years and can be rendered largely free of the immune difficulties we have with functioning organs    Simple tissue grafts far outnumber organ transplants

Nono it's uber and lyft who will own a fleet of them and you will get rides in them for pennies on the dollar compared to todays prices

First your assessment that it will be ""pennies on the dollar"" is so ridiculous it's not even worth arguing  But I am going to do it anyway  it's going to be more expensive not less )

   The most obvious     
When was the last time a company lowered their pricing models because they got rid of the human element  In fact how about any company lowering their established pricing models on anything in any industry for any reason  You said ""pennies on the dollar"" that means that it is at the very least 90% less than a standard rate  So what you are saying is that a taxi ride that's what it is) will now cost 100 instead of 1000  Even the most economically naive person could not possibly claim this with a straight face

   Not as obvious     
From what I have read Uber takes 20% of the cut of each fare  This mean they get 20% for nothing more than hosting the app and creating the connection They do not own the car they do not pay for the fuel insurance or car payment So basically what you are saying is not only will Uber charge LESS for the ride but they will also buy all the new automated cars pay all the fees cover all the maintenance insurance the responsibility and then  lower the fee significantly 

Right now as it stands with their 20% cut Uber etc are losing money a LOT of money  Uber lost over TWO BILLION in 2015 

So please explain to me how it's going to be ""pennies on the dollar"" after they start picking up    all    the expenses that go with it 

At that point why would you want to own a car 

Uber and Lyft and all the other app services have existed since the automobile was invented they are called Taxi's  There is literally no difference between a taxi and uber except one is legally licensed and regulated to do the work and is  indemnified by an actual company  The same reason not everyone rides in taxi's is why people will still own cars whether they are automated or not  This notion that everyone will have no issue calling up an automated car and  waiting  for it to arrive every time you want to leave your house work or the store is complete fantasy  It works in a big city it doesn't work anywhere else

I am in a suburb if I call a cab it will take at the very least 10 minutes to get here This doesn't consider the fact that 75% of the population goes to work at the same time They leave work at the same time they go to the grocery store the movies etc all in the same peak periods  This means that there has to be an over abundance of vehicles OR you have to ride share which would further hinder any time related needs and isn't in any way attractive to the average consumer  A 5 minute normal ride to a store to pick up some munchies turns into a 20 30 minute thing with taxi rides

This doesn't even touch the subject of where all these cars are going to be stored charged and maintained If everyone calls Uber Uber is going to need dozens of millions of cars if not hundreds of millions  Right now virtually every vehicle is in a garage a driveway  Imagine if Uber needed 10 thousand cars for just a small city in New York state  Where are they going to be stored  How long will it take them to get to their call  

One last thing to keep in mind in terms of ""why"") every thing you do everywhere you go will be recorded  Good luck with that

Automated cars are frikin awesome can't wait to own one but they will NOT usher in a new age of non car ownership and taxi rides and they will not be cheaper There are literally 100 other things I could list that blow everyones fantasy out of the water and you know them you just won't admit them",

4884.0,t3_8o3lze,"I must disagree with the article's pronouncement of what we ""need to accept"" The burden is on the technology developers to clearly demonstrate that their design is better than the status quo enough better to justify the added cost In the earlier days of self\ driving cars there was a wholly unwarranted presumption on the part of many that self\ driving cars were going to be absolutely safe and the general public is slowly becoming educated on the limitations of the technology

If you really understand how Deep Learning systems operate you'll know that they're a total black box that cannot be verified to operate properly by any manner of proof It's been demonstrated that changing of even a single pixel can change object classification decisions It's been demonstrated that pasting small images of other signs in the blank space of signs can cause them to be misrecognized because the black\ block Deep Learning recognizers are designed to read signs at a variety of scales In the recent Uber case a software failure caused the perception of a pedestrian obstacle in the middle of the road to be effectively ignored

All this technology is also going to cost money it'll make cars more expensive but the ability to drive away from the destination enables cars to be shared which can greatly affect the actual cost of ownership the number of cars on the road and the occupancy and eventually the need for parking spaces Nevertheless if the added cost of the technology isn't balanced by a decrease in the cost of killing and maiming drivers passengers occupants of other vehicles pedestrians and bystanders we should be highly resistant to accepting these products

That's not to say it's the way it's going to happen People were so in love with their cell phones that they failed to resist the temptation to use them while they were driving exacting an extremely high cost in lives lost and injuries that persist to the present day Users are paying the price of this in their automobile insurance cost but these costs are not redeemed by the companies responsible for the manufacture marketing or sales of cell phones \  so far cell phone makers haven't been obliged to pay for a failure to make their products safe Regulation has encouraged makers to add facilities for hands\ free use which has not yet been proven to make them safe to use while driving \  indeed studies to date suggest that users still become too cognitively occupied to safely operate a vehicle and a phone together

Current half\ driving cars on the market present another danger particularly given users' penchants for operating them beyond the stated capabilities defeating safety systems such as by pressing an orange into the steering wheel and so forth There's been clear evidence that reducing the driver's workload with these systems makes the driver less attentive to the task rendering them unable to assist the half\ driver when it malfunctions or needs to pass control back to the driver Unlike airplanes where there may be many seconds before an autopilot\ controlled plane becomes unsafe or uncontrollable the geometry of the driving task demands sub\ second responses to unusual conditions",

but that's not the case with self driving cars even if you're a good driver it does not have any outcome on how car drives thats like taking away control from the hands of humans its like playing Russian roulette where its totally upto luck and not your driving whether you'll be killed on this particular car ride or not

Most of us would sacrifice one person to save five It’s a pretty straightforward bit of moral math But if we have to actually kill that person ourselves the math gets fuzzy

That’s the lesson of the classic Trolley Problem a moral puzzle that fried our brains in an episode we did about 11 years ago Luckily the Trolley Problem has always been little more than a thought experiment mostly confined to conversations at a certain kind of cocktail party That is until now New technologies are forcing that moral quandry out of our philosophy departments and onto our streets So today we revisit the Trolley Problem and wonder how a two ton hunk of speeding metal will make moral calculations about life and death that we can’t even figure out ourselves

Next we need to acknowledge just how bad human drivers are at controlling their own vehicles – and how they compare to autonomous vehicles   


 In 2016 there were 40,200 vehicular fatalities just in the United States A Stanford review found that 90 percent of accidents are caused at least in part by human error whether that’s overcorrecting falling prey to a distraction or drinking alcohol before getting behind the wheel Some quick math tells you that’s 36,180 lives that were lost because a human behind the wheel of a car made a mistake with similar numbers year over year  


Here they used the words ""and how they  human drivers  compare to autonomous vehicles"" but in the statistic they provide they don't account for the ratio of autonomous vehicles to manually operated vehicles That would be the more interesting and relevant statistic and we could really see if self driving cars are less accident prone

Yes Autonomous Cars Are Going To Kill People Before They Save Lives Expert Says by  izumi3682 in r/Futurology

     \ –\ izumi3682\ S\  1 point 5 days ago      Yes yes it does That is the unvarnished reality today Autonomous cars especially semi\ autonomous cars ARE going to kill people before they save lives Yes humans will die in level 5 autonomy SDVs There is no avoiding it But what is say 500 human lives per year from SDV related causes vs 35,000 from human caused MVAs I'll tell you what it is\ \ unacceptable to USA society

And I understand the goal is zero deaths due to human caused MVAs but the implication of that statement is that it is highly likely that more human lives will be lost to the development of this technology despite our best efforts to avoid that outcome I seriously suspect that this is more of an over\ exuberant business model than a technological obstacle Yes that was directed straight at Tesla The automobile manufacturers are putting these into vehicles as an attractive ""futuristic"" feature The idea behind these level 3 and level 4 hand\ offs is that the human stays fully alert and hands on the wheel at all times But people being people get bored and think things are under better control than they may actually be Then they start watching movies and climbing into the backseat to film the miracle of technology Or worse there is conflict in the engineering itself which caused that Uber Tempe incident Tesla itself states that the driver should keep hands on the wheel observant even during auto\ pilot mode People just don't follow the rules is all Then one or another human is killed in direct relation to the developing technology and everyone gets all bent out of shape and wants to ban the further development of SDVs altogether Never mind that more than 85 humans were killed by human caused MVAs that day

I don't know I guess we have to just suck it up with this level 3 and level 4 autonomy as we proceed towards full level 5 autonomy A level in which there is no steering wheel no brake and no accelerator And i say thank god we are going to see this in less than 5 years The combination of mapping tracking intervehicle communication and of course that intrinsic AI that is going to bring about a revolution like nothing seen on Earth since the horse stopped being the main mode of human transportation around 1913 I just don't want anything to disrupt or slow the advance of this technology and it's implementation into society

Waymo and Apple among several others are developing exclusively level 5 autonomy SDVs They have known from the start that you can't halfstep this technology It is all or nothing And ""all"" is going succeed

Seriously I discussed this just yesterday Here is the link if you are interested But have faith yes faith in this astonishing convergence of technologies Oh and by the way guess what  There is also serious work on level 5 autonomy human passenger carrying drones as well They could well transcend ground SDVs altogether

And this is with a simplified scenario Depending on what the final technology requires what happens if external sensors or signal broadcasters are required by AV's just to function reliably  I'm thinking especially of snowy or icy conditions where the cars on board sensors may not be able to detect the edge or center of a road reliably Right now roads and road signals are mostly paid for by the public If an AV kills someone and it was icy and there is a question about whether some road implanted signaling device failed does that make that city/county/state partially responsible  This is likely to provide for entirely new departments of lawyers being required in many legal firms to handle the increased demand for both prosecuting and defense lawyers

This is terrifying ideology For example a woman killed her newborn in a town elsewhere in my state by shaking it because ‘it wouldn’t eat’ The CT scan showed six blunt force injuries on the brain Everyone finds this abhorrent How is abortion not on the same page  A human fetus is a human too  I digress—People die in cars and that is a terrible thing to happen Someone dies in an autonomous vehicle and that’s ‘For the Cause ’

Someone getting killed is such a desensitized event in the world now that the selling point for future tech egautonomous vehicles) is that some people will die during testing and  that is okay  Some people died at Sandy Hook elementary; was that “okay” in order to improve security at schools  No And if you think it was you extremely need to rethink some things about yourself

Here’s the reality of the situation  Loss of life is   never   okay Every person is unique and wonderful and beautifully made Never should there be technology or ideas that we explore where human mortality is not THE utmost concern Autonomous vehicles shouldn’t be sold under the notion that “you’re an early user so you may die but that’s a sacrifice we are willing to make because our product is better at driving than you),”  a la Lord Farquad (https //youtube/hiKuxfcSrEU) It’s nonsensical 

Death comes for us all that’s the consequence of our sin Yes we accept that But sacrificing people for technological advancements isn’t that illegal   Not to mention hugely unethical  (https //enmwikipediaorg/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation) Read the United States’ section The 1962 Kefauver Harris Drug Amendment to the Federal Food Drug & Consumer Act requires companies to prove  safety  and  effectiveness  of their products They’re prioritizing human life and wellness now as law requires Why aren’t autonomous car companies trying to sell their products with the focal selling point being the BEST safety and effectiveness too  Surely this is being investigated  Surely the autonomous vehicle companies aren’t experimenting  Why should we accept a product that isn’t proven effective and safe in the highest degree 

I don’t think we   should   accept it Not until it’s been shown to be safe There are good and bad drivers on the roads every time we get in a car we risk our lives But we take penicillin because we know it’s been proven effective and safe and labeled as such I drive my particular car because it’s been proven safe and effective at keeping me that way I buckle my seatbelt for the same reason; it’s proven to be safe and effective Why shouldn’t an autonomous vehicle be subject to the same parameters

Example   

 You are driving an autonomous vehicle A hazard presents itself where your car must now decide whether to A) sacrifice you the driver to save the other person; or B) sacrifice the other person to save you   

An autonomous vehicle would have to be programmed with parameters to make this decision If the hazard is a child and you're a middle aged person should not the vehicle sacrifice you

Now a couple things have happened the original places where suburbs were built are now either swallowed up by the cities themselves or fell into disrepair either way the land was either too valuable or not valuable enough to develop so they kept building out and out Combine that with the end of the nuclear family everyone needed their own house and when grandpa and grandma retired they literally moved to some place in Arizona or Florida that was just houses for miles in infrastructure to move a lot of people to the nearest town everyday because they were retired they all didn’t need to go to work so it’s just literally thousands of houses in the middle of nowhere because the property is dirt cheap 

So what am I getting at  The way our society developed after the 40s was we basically assumed everyone had a car so our infrastructure was built around that We basically made it so if you want a good job you must have a car So now issuing or taking away a drivers license wasn’t just something you do as a reward or punishment it was literally giving or taking food shelter and opportunities Even today some people from the city have never had to own a car or lean to drive storing it cost a fortune driving it is a hassle most people keep one for emergencies if they have one at all You cant see that in the suburbs if you don’t have a car your usually confined to whatever job is within walking distance usually low paid convenience store labor or if your lucky you could carpool

Of course you should take that pill which will reduce your probability of cancer death from 10% to 15% It would be dumb to get caught up on the fact that the pill adds a new risk of cancer when it more than offsets that new risk by eliminating 90% of the current risk The pill way improves your probability of avoiding death overall so don’t be a dummy; use it

Car insurance is a legal requirement in the UK which is sensible in theory but results in dysfunctional market behaviour with disproportionate costs for younger drivers I think that it should therefore be run as a government monopoly a National Insurance Service) so that the risk is equally shared across the population 

The disadvantage of this sort of system is that it removes the incentive to reduce risk by eg buying lower performance vehicles with lower replacement value However most people have no more desire to damage their car than their health even if the government bears the financial cost so I think that the good outweighs the bad

If healthcare & car insurance are both provided by central government the savings associated with self driving cars are passed on to taxpayers rather than taken as profit by private industry which is probably a good thing because it may be argued that this will increase spending & therefore growth) more effectively

In the manufacturer pays case if a manufacturer is liable and understates the risk then their insurance provider will charge them more or refuse to cover it The consumer might lose some of the value of their car because they get a poor reputation for safety but in all likelihood it will be in the manufacturer's best interests to remedy the problem ASAP as well as the consumer's

In the customer pays case the customers are accepting an unknown and unknowable amount of liability when they purchase such a vehicle The insurance premium could go through the roof they could effectively be rendered uninsurable and the only incentive for the manufacturer to fix anything is bad press or if they are forced into a recall",

5690.0,t1_e00y6st,"I think this is over played It’s hard to base a safety case upon sensors extrinsic to the vehicle because it’s difficult to verify data integrity 

In any case the vehicle must be safe in isolation eg it must pass an elk test in fog at night either by seeing through the fog or driving within the limits of its sensors

Intra vehicle data cannot replace conventional signals because human drivers are still legal at EIS so the manoeuvre cadence can’t increase 

Vehicle manufacturers have little incentive to share data because if eg Fords cooperate with Fords then network effects will favour big players & freeze out disruptive new entrants Legislation may therefore be required to force sharing However integrity is harder if the standard is open & this sort of distributed asynchronous system is really hard to police no I don’t think blockchain is the solution) I suppose it could be done with public key cryptography & a really big database of VINs but then integrity verification would depend on internet access which might not be dependable eg in tunnels or remote areas

So you're choices are
1) Use their system and accept the 0001% of getting in an accident that you already agreed to be liable for 

2) Dont use their system and drive yourself and accept the 99999% more risk of getting in an accident you're liable for 

Both choices result in you being liable but option 1 means your much less likely to get in an accident 

Not only that but insurance companies will look at those statistics and greatly reduce your premium if you choose 1 since they are 99999% less likely to have to pay you out Conversely if you choose option 2 your premiums will be much higher because the odds that they have to pay up are higher 

Hope that helps explain why the driver will always be liable in the case of SDC accidents

Another reason why someone might have to stop at the end of a merge is because we occasionally have some ridiculously short acceleration lanes Here's one I have to take once every few months or so when I'm in the area

The speed limit there is 65 so you have to go from about 25 MPH to 65 MPH and the only space you have to accelerate is between the blue lines Oh and because of the angles you can't tell if there's someone coming up on you who isn't moving over until you hit the blue dot  which means you're probably going 45 or 50

There's a  lot  of accelerating and then slamming your brakes that goes on at that exit There's also a ton of people who refuse to move over and in rush hour sometimes they can't I've been run into the shoulder multiple times at that exit and that's not the only example I can think of ",

That is what gets people in trouble because you are not the first person who has done this If you don't own any land it means you are always parking on land belonging to someone else

But if you had somewhere you could LEGALLY park as in express permission from the land owner you might be alright for the most part However I would add laws are different everywhere and complicated A van is not considered a residence so you would not have some of the rights you would have for sleeping in a van instead of a house They might just declare it illegal anyway even if it had a bed in there and declare it a form of vagrancy

AI is a whole different situation and it’s hard to predict since we don’t know how the programming is going to look like in its final version These self driving cars are going to be making choices without our own input just the input of whoever programmed it Do you stop or swerve for an animal  Does that decision change if someone is behind in front or in another lane  Would that choice be the same for a human instead of an animal in the road  If there isn’t time to stop and multiple things are in the road what do you hit  Do you hit a pedestrian or risk killing the driver and passengers  How are these choices made  Who is at legal fault for anything that happens

   Being able to honk the horn (https //youtube/tBJ0GvsQeak t=1540) is both awesome and possibly terrible  Hopefully Waymo rate limits it or something so you can't just lay into it
   Traffic speed really helps (https //youtube/tBJ0GvsQeak t=1779) in Phoenix  Notice everyone is driving 43 in a 45 roughly  In the Atlanta suburbs a street like this would be 45mph limited road but everyone would be doing 55mph+
   School Zone  https //youtube/tBJ0GvsQeak t=1975) and notice the screen says ""Slow Zone"" in yellow to let the passenger know why it's going slow on purpose  In Atlanta everyone would be doing 35mph but in Phoenix everyone else seems to be speeding and doing 45mph
   No idea how Waymo picks lanes and when (https //youtube/tBJ0GvsQeak t=2399)  Sometimes it picks the lane based on how it will turn 5 miles down the road  Other times it changes lanes at the last moment like this example  In general it seems to stick center but not always
   Never seen anyone turn on a blinker for a cul de sac (https //youtube/tBJ0GvsQeak t=2523) not even a school bus

  Ride 3    

   Wow the destination picker is really cool (https //youtube/tBJ0GvsQeak t=2576) and I've never seen it before  It seems both extensive and random with odd location omitted  Not really a complaint just trying to understand the logic  More than enough options to the point of too many which almost begs the question why some places aren't allowed
   Mask required even in an autonomous ride (https //youtube/tBJ0GvsQeak t=2588)  Seems like it would be easy to roll all the window down for a bit once the drop off is complete to air out the vehicle  Might not have access to do that in a Pacificia  Platform is everything this would be easy for Tesla
   Waymo is stalking you (https //youtube/tBJ0GvsQeak t=2569) it's like something out of a horror movie  From the time you hit search it was 12s before I could hear the wine of the thing approaching and 17s before it rounded the corner to pick you up  That's faster than I could summon my Tesla from the parking lot  Ok I could probably get an Uber quicker than I could summon my Tesla but you get the point; it's faster than is should work  You barely got done requesting the car
   $136/mile is a pretty good deal (https //youtube/tBJ0GvsQeak t=2626)
   I can see the construction zone (https //youtube/tBJ0GvsQeak t=2812) and correctly determines which lanes are not usable  Reminds me of the cones in the Tesla but they are actually cones and not hydrants and other random objects
   Reckless guy (https //youtube/tBJ0GvsQeak t=3629) and oncoming traffic is impressive for sure  The guy was 100% in the wrong but I'm guessing he did it because of the awkward pause Waymo did after the big truck was clear  Would love to know what the car was thinking during that entire turn

32.0,t3_jaxrjv,At about 1hr3m it shows how it handled pedestrians,
33.0,t3_jaxrjv,I think the Waymo did fine at 1 00 24 but I wonder if the reckless guy  has had bad experiences waiting behind Waymos for those left turns,
34.0,t3_jaxrjv,"1 The noises you're hearing are a combination of lidars spinning radar fans and the computer

35.0,t3_jaxrjv,Absolutely surreal I imagine this video might get picked up in a few news stories Excellent video ,
36.0,t3_jaxrjv,"What I found interesting and why   Ride 1 

   Very beginning when Waymo stops to let you in (https //youtube/tBJ0GvsQeak t=21) it just sort of hangs out well away from the curb barely on the right side of a street  I know they hand map pickup/dropoff locations and this is like a super small side road so it is no problem but I would have expected the pickup to be the other side of the street heading out and the car would be better positioned  Pickup/Dropoff locations are a long tail hard part of the puzzle for sure
   Turning around in the cul de sac (https //youtube/tBJ0GvsQeak t=58) was both super impressive and annoying at the same time  It bothers me for some reason turning the wheel that much without moving  When they eventually remove the wheel I'm going to be wondering what the car is doing just sitting there so at least right now the wheel provides context  From other parts of the video they seem to have the concept of slowly moving to pre position the wheel while moving slowly  Maybe the gas platform doesn't give them enough control to do this reliably in tight spaces like this
   Leaving the small pickup street (https //youtube/tBJ0GvsQeak t=96) the car didn't come to a full stop  Is this legal 
   Getting on the main street (https //youtube/tBJ0GvsQeak t=149) takes a good bit of time  Maybe right turns onto double lane streets is the new unprotected left   In the Atlanta suburbs where I live you would be trapped until 10pm exiting like this car does  You have to exit 10x more aggressively or you won't make it out
   Avoids a trailer (https //youtube/tBJ0GvsQeak t=656) parked in the road after a 90 degree bend in the road  Tesla would will have trouble doing that given it's current sensor locations
   Another right onto a dual lane road (https //youtube/tBJ0GvsQeak t=681) that takes a bit  This one is extra interesting as it is careful to wait even when it has a clear lane but lets a car in the adjacent lane get by before turning  I do the same thing on roads with light traffic since you never know when someone will change lanes on you
   Man this car is noisy (https //youtube/tBJ0GvsQeak t=793)  I'm not sure if it's the filming equipment for some of it  There are more rattles road noise creaks steering wheel groans etc that any car I've ridden in lately  I'd stab the blinker speaker with a knife if I owned this car
   Lots of talk about it turning the wheels ahead of time (https //youtube/tBJ0GvsQeak t=1091) like in this situation  I think they do this to reduce reaction time on unprotected lefts maybe   I think they have issues with low speed throttle/steering coordination in general  Either way it doesn't have to be a saftey problem  They should know if someone is about to hit them and they could turn the wheels in the direction of least danger before impact
   Is Waymo really this loud from outside (https //youtube/tBJ0GvsQeak t=1484) or is the gain on the mic up a lot or have I just owned a Tesla too long at this point   Sounds like a bus vacuum or light aircraft",
37.0,t3_jaxrjv,This is awesome ,
38.0,t3_jaxrjv,"  Ride 5   

   Pedestrian handling is impressive (https //youtube/tBJ0GvsQeak t=3829) but to be honest I'm taking a point off for not simply avoiding the front at all costs  I guess it's in testing but hopefully they have a switch to avoid the front doors of Costco and Target  All other stores don't seem as bad but those two are time sinks  I will also say this is super light pedestrian traffic from my experiences  In Atlanta you have to push your way through and it still takes  10 minutes to drive by the front doors
   Apparently Chandler has a ""Fashion Center"" (https //youtube/tBJ0GvsQeak t=3965)   Who knew
   Runs a yellow light (https //youtube/tBJ0GvsQeak t=4032) which is good
   Example of steering Wheel ""Glitching"" (https //youtube/tBJ0GvsQeak t=4755) that happens from time to time  Not sure what this is or why it happens  The car doesn't seem to move it's almost like a weird very small shutter
   Arrival notice (https //youtube/tBJ0GvsQeak t=4764) seems to be based on point to point distance rather than remaining time  Previously you would get a notice as you made the final turn but here you get it well before you arrive because you have to basically do a long u turn to arrive  Something they should work on  Not a huge issue but you start having problems with seat belts being removed and such if you notice too soon",
39.0,t3_jaxrjv,"Ha  ""Allergic to main roads"" What a strange route

I only had time to watch the first ride so far but great video Thanks  The car does a pretty good job was surprisingly 'bold' in the few left turns but then spends miles in the left lane which would be aggravating to other drivers if they do that a lot

I guess they use a Toro leaf blower to cool the electronics 

I don't think the ""reckless driver"" at 1 00 38 was really trying to cut in front It seems he just eased into his turn a bit early and the Waymo stopped out of caution With the Waymo stopped the other drive then proceeded

What's up on South Sandpiper  Starting around 1 17 25 it takes drainage dips and crosswalks at 35 mph then slows way down for one crosswalk and again for a drainage dip

Mask required

I'll quote the in app support article ""The Waymo car's HVAC system automatically refreshes the cabin air between riders"" I believe they worked with FCA on that system But they do also recommend rolling the windows down

Waymo has done a lot of testing in the Bay Area  So they will probably roll something out there next year

They have been doing a lot of non profit deliveries with drivers  It might be possible for them to do that without the drivers and for profit if they can get some people to come to the curb or a designated place for stopping  That could mean food deliveries or other types of product deliveries  Just requires the restaurant/store and the person receiving the delivery to agree ahead time to walk out to a drop off/pickup location

96.0,t1_g8scaxl,Well maybe easier on the tires but sorry the blinker and turn lane should be the signal to other drivers  From behind no one can see the front tires and when coming the other direction at 45mph on a chandler street you’re going to see that signal first as well  If you do get rear ended and pushed into that 45 mph traffic then you risk a horrific head on accident The odds are low but consequences are high That’s why it’s called defensive driving,

98.0,t1_g8sgfmg,I was thinking of making a version of only the unprotected left turns those are pretty popular haha,
99.0,t1_g8wamtj,Well it's just a steering control/ECU issue The car is using steering wheel angles SWA) and reference points to calculate the 0 angle of the steering wheel perfectly horizontal and center steering is 0 angle) and making calculations to turn the steering wheel to the left or right In your timestamp the car is making a left lane change to get into the left turn lane So the wheel is turning left and then countersteering to the right to get back to the center or 0 SWA Essentially its what humans would do but we don't have to worry about calculations or algorithms When we turn the wheel it's smooth but the car is trying to turn the wheel and then counter turn the wheel all within a few seconds At the end of the day it's still a robot The actions it takes are going to be for some part robotic Though I would argue that if there is a good collaboration between FCA and Waymo those steering movements can be much smoother because FCA can share data on their internal CAN system values and ECU configurations,

I'm surprised they haven't planned on having them from the beginning but I think you're correct these were a quick retro fit  I think they needed them to protect the driver and more importantly the controls when in full self driving mode like they are now  I'm pretty down on them for their platform choice but I acknowledge this is still just a testing platform  I hope they are learning and do better with the next car  I still think they should buy a car manufacture and build them  I wouldn't suggest anyone else on earth to do that buy Waymo should

105.0,t1_g8sf6nn,There are plenty of places you can drive without freeways Cities for example allow a lot of commuting without highway driving So for long trips it wouldn't work for now at least) but still allows for a lot of rides And just because they haven't released that for public riders doesn't mean they're not working on it They might just want to be extra careful because crashes on highways tend to be a lot worse than crashes at lower speeds and crashes resulting in deaths are much worse for publicity,

First let me clarify my statement I am saying that it would take Tesla more than 10 years to create something as confident/reliable as this video with their current hardware   And I know they plan on continuing with this hardware as that is their strategy and they have been promising FSD with this current hardware

take a company that is pretty good at innovating

I agree Tesla is great at innovating and an extremely exciting company  However for them to create what you see in this video with their hardware and strategy will several times harder than what Waymo has done it will require vastly more technology breakthroughs that are not in the foreseeable future If Tesla were to drop their current strategy and hardware and start over and create a Waymo clone I am sure they could do that in  5 years or so  But they do not intent to do that

when you have pretty much half a million cars or more collecting driving data worldwide on edge cases

 sigh  you and everyone else have got to drop this man it's a useful tool but is really far less relevant and important than you believe

Waymo has at last publishing in 2019 a fleet of 600 vehicles Even if they quadrupled that it's still less than 2500 vehicles out in the wild collecting data

Irrelevant

I don't think it's a hardware issue at this time it's more getting the software right,

Yes but when you have less hardware redundancies  the software doesn't need to be a little better it needs to be 100x  1000x times better  

 100 200k people that already bought it it's going to be a massive change

Only 100 200k    It's gotta be higher than this Tesla is selling 100k vehicles per quarter 

1 5 years is probably my best case idea for Tesla's software to be at this level we are seeing

279.0,t1_g8kz21z,"It isn't that the points you raise aren't valid they are  However I think you overestimate the size of the population you are talking about  The 5% number /u/rileyoneill used is the correct percentage of the population that is truly rural  I've lived in very rural towns most of my life and if you look at them from the air you will see that most of the population of the country centers around a single town and very few live more than a few miles from that town  Some do but it's a very small number

The other aspect of your position that I think you get wrong is that you hold the world the same while introducing SDCs into it  If it costs me $6k/year to use an SDC service or $6k/year to own a car then yeah maybe a lot will stick with the car  But what happens when the SDC service is $1k/year and the car is $15k/year   There are a lot of ways to drive the costs down on the SDC side but the car is only going to get more expensive just like they have for decades

  especially those with a little money who are never going to want to use a shared service for anything

I personally think this is the cohort that will start the process  Sure we'll have people in major US cities taking Luxury iPace SDCs to sporting events first but the real impact is when a company automates buses and rides can be done cheaper than city buses with more convenience",
280.0,t1_g8kz21z,How about a “family subscription” where each member of the family has access to a Waymo service for one monthly payment  That is a very different prospect to a single person who uses their car often The difference in cost could be huge Personal ownership will drop significantly due to robotaxi services Will this make a difference to car prices when the manufacturers are making robotaxi’s instead of personal cars ,
281.0,t1_g8lrqnu,"I'm personally not ""excited""  I can afford to drive anything I want and basically do  That said I can't see a future where most people own cars  It simply doesn't make sense  

The population that actually likes owning cars is very very small  The population that says they would own a car rather than use a service simply doesn't understand what the world of SDCs will look like  That isn't surprising since almost no one really knows what it will look like  Given all the reasonable possibilities though  the vast majority will go for cost and convince over owning a car",

Parking in major cities is also a huge expense and a huge pain in the ass  Cities have to be built around parking for them to be economically viable but once people are getting around and not needing parking spaces that parking can be converted to something far more productive  Los Angeles has enough parking to fit 3 San Franciscos converting parking to moderate density housing in LA could house a few million people   Eliminate this parking and there will be far more people and far less parking the remaining parking could be extremely expensive  The SDC ride could cost you $4 but if you want to drive yourself and park it could cost $20 for the parking  

There is also an issue of politics  Once 60 70% of the population are off oil based transportation they are going to treat it like cigarettes and vote to tax the hell out of it   $7 $8 per gallon of gasoline could be a political reality  Look at what happened with cigarette taxes in places where smoking is unpopular 

There will likely be many negative feedback cycles for regular driving that convince a lot of people to give it up  This could be an absolutely viscous cycle of increasing costs decreasing convenience and reduced quality of service

Of course you the other big hurdle is getting to scale so you can get to those prices  To some degree industry might make this push and run at losses to build scale  The other likely case is that consumers that can't handle the large up front costs of a car will jump ship to SDC fleets as they are forced out of their old car by repairs of leases ending  

Imagine being presented with $300/month for you or $600/month for your family for SDC fleet service  You other option is to spend $2k repairing your existing car  Put $5k down and $350/month to buy a car or sign a lease for $300/month that you know will end in you forking over $2k in charges at the end of it like you last one did",

I could imagine a reasonable situation where every fleet SDC had lights and could go into emergency mode  This mode allowed them to assume right away and ignore signals like emergency vehicles do now  For your average citizen this would be locked down to certain destinations like Hospitals and such  I could see an additional fee or something to keep it from being abused  Probably the best way would be to have the hospital charge you if you don't get services rendered

Getting the person who needs medical care from PointA to Hospital will always be faster than getting an ambulance from PointB to PointA to Hospital  It's situational if PointB to PointA is faster or slower than PointA to Hospital  If it is you could always consider Ambulances to be an allowed emergency destination and intersect at a point optimal for both the Ambulance and the SDC to get meet the Ambulance to finish the journey

Basically all of these things can be or already have been worked out Uber type rating systems have ended dumpy dirty cabs pretty well and that'll be further improved with SDCs  google vehicles look new basically at all times Uber type cab apps also give you pricing well in advance  and w/ flat per km rates you'll pretty much know how much a trip costs without even looking just like you can with your own car Availability isn't really an issue either if you're in a city

I do think that cabs will take a long time to spread to rural areas for a large number of reasons but car ownership in a city over 100,000people should be silly for anyone but the wealthy within the next 10 years

Taking the driver out of taxis changes nothing except the price of the taxi ride

Ah well it changes who has control Google having power over 10,000 cars vs 10,000 cab owners Google will certainly reduce prices further and give a very uniform experience Like when McDonalds created fast food and obliterated burger joints or megafarms obliterating tiny farms Eliminating the driver cuts the price by 2/3rds corporate control cuts it in half or by 1/3rd again And increased usage drops prices further Once the prices are competitive with the city bus you're talking about SERIOUS increases in usage

It also creates a smoother safer ride and you don't have to deal with another person you still get privacy) So you can sing bad music loudly still or sleep or watch TV without it being weird just like in your own car No conversation is expected and you could comfortably send your child alone in one unlike now No risk of getting scammed unlike now

PLUS SDCs could come in more flavours Atm you can get a regular cab a van moving trucks limos or buses  with a bigger user base they could add tiny efficient vehicles for 1 person they could have ones with beds ones with big screen TVs ones with VR sets some stocked with a bar or a vending machine and snacks If you're just napping on the way home from/to work then take the tiny 1 seater at 1/5th the price of a normal car putting you well below bus prices) Take a high speed vehicle between cities to cut time If you set up an account then the service could remember your settings too for music and w/e you want

If you live in a rural area and are wealthy you certainly will not use these very often maybe you can buy a bunch of vehicles But if you earn under 60k and live in the city you probably won't buy your own vehicle in a decade or so from now If you live in a town then maybe that line is more like 50k or 40k",

Also that 3ft spacing or wait Nobody gives me 3ft of space when I'm on a bike They'd have to switch lanes as they passed me And as I lane share when cars are at a stop light that would mean those cars could not continue until I had passed and they were able to change lanes ",

Honestly we're still very far from true autonomous driving for a lot of reasons the biggest one being infrastructure  We can't predict what the state of self driving tech will be when worrying about the weather becomes one of the big problems they move on to  For all we know it'll be a non issue that ends up solved by accident as a result of solving a different problem or implementing a new system

I guess that's my point  The snow problem for a fraction of users for a fraction of the year is not a today problem so we can't look at today's tech to point out why it can't be solved  Once we solve today's problems we'll use tomorrow's tech to evaluate tomorrow's problems

Hypothetical   We end up developing some advanced sensor/AI system able to navigate unknown routes without needing to reference preset maps and navigation data letting people take side roads and even travel off road  Then they discover that routine is also able to dynamically update existing navigational data when the system detects unexpected road conditions like snow or road construction  No need for a special snow sub system",
279.0,t1_fbzpnpu,"That’s precisely what I meant The technology is there but adoption is 100 years away at least widespread where it’s more common to have a self driving car for the average consumer than a “manually driven” car

There’s numerous factors that limit this beyond just “people wanting to trust themselves” 

  Cost  in an era with wage stagnation and rising costs of living there are entire demographics that have no car or can only afford to buy 20 year old beaters every couple years these people won’t be able to likely own one of these self drivers for a generation or two The middle ish class that can afford new cars within the current generation will likely hold off on adoption until its proven technology as many of these people have families that will not trust in the hands of a computer yet This leaves consumer adoption with the wealthy elite that have both need and money or the technically affluent that stays with the latest developments

  regulation  this is probably going to be a slow nut to crack until it’s been proven and insurance companies get fully behind it easier than pricing but harder than the development of the tech

  used car market  this is basically where the majority of America buys through and as I stated most car models see 20 30 years in circulation overall it will take at least this long for self drivers to be widely available to consumers I expect the business market like trucking and cabs to be pushed for first) and then another 20 30 for non self drivers to cycle out of the market to where having a “manual” car is as rare as owning a car with “manual transmission” is today Then another 20 30 years where a non self driver is a “classic” collector type thing

If anything everyone is vastly underestimating the dates  problems and scenarios   

Am I worried self driving cars will remove jobs  Yes   But not for 30 years   Even if self driving was perfect today   It would take 10 years to get reasonable market penetration 

Example   the first Prius which was crazy popular came out in 1997   That’s 22 years ago  Electric cars today make up less than 5% of cars sold   Self driving will take a similar road map to electric cars as they both add an additional cost to vehicles  

Right now I would argue full self driving cars aren’t even at the first Prius point which really only got like 35 45 mpg and was pretty weak Today at the consumer level we only have glorified cruise control and some cool tech and test vehicles that drive by themselves with humans monitoring them   no fully automatic driving at a consumer level  

The first vehicles to go full AI will be long haul truckers because it’s the simplest problem to solve   Freeway only driving   We dont have this yet working at a good enough level and this isn’t even accounting for the politics of it

Who is going to think of this extremely specific scenario and test to make sure it doesn't happen  Probably no one until it happens Then Tesla would go in and fix the error and the AI will never crash under these circumstances again

Tesla takes the attitude of software design sometimes

All that said Tesla actually does a lot of heavy testing and checks The problem of being at the edge is that there's edge cases that only happen 0001% of the time and it's really hard to fix Remember when  Toyota's modification of accelerators and mats resulted in a huge amount of accidents (https //wwwmotorauthoritycom/news/1052870_toyota to pay 10 million in crash settlement mats still to blame)  It took over 3 years since the issue was identified and Toyota would still deny the obvious Tesla's engineering is top notch and their cars have had less security issues and better fixes than their competitors throughout the years Blame the culture and management but the engineering is top notch human and sometimes making mistakes but as good quality as any other car maker

As a matter of fact that will be the problem that self driving cars will have There will be errors and failures that will result in deaths But even if self driving cars do only slightly better than the average you'd have to go to tens of thousands of deaths before it wouldn't still be a better idea than not doing it But people don't see it like that it's the airplane fallacy someone would rather go drive cross country out of fear of dying on an airplane crash when in reality the moment they have the highest chance of dying on a flight is on the drive to and back from the airport a cross country trip is incredibly dangerous in comparison But because seeing someone die being run over or due to a car crash is an every day occurrence no one really talks about and we don't think But airplane crashes are so rare we obsess over them The safer car gets the more national news a car crash will be

In this specific case though Musk shot himself on the foot IMHO Had he been less combative this wouldn't have escalated into an issue that is national news The tech is not at a point that's ready to ask for regulation revisits and offering more freedom on it While it may be mature enough that this would be beneficial we really don't have enough data Even if Tesla is doing it right it's not easy to imagine what regulations must be set someone else could come with their cheap version that screws everyone and sets back the regulatory evolution of self driving cars a decade There is such a thing as too soon",

The fatality rate for human drivers  is 111 deaths per 100 million miles traveled (https //wwwiihsorg/topics/fatality statistics/detail/state by state)

 Tesla has about 1 million cars with autopilot on the road (https //cleantechnicacom/2020/01/05/over 730000 tesla vehicles with autopilot 2 3 on the road/)

 The average driver drives 260 miles per week (https //wwwforbescom/sites/advisor/2020/04/27/we cut our driving in half is it time for pay per mile insurance/ sh=1ba0daa72d30)

So Telsa drivers alone are collectively averaging 260 million miles per week

This means that even if the Tesla autopilot got into a fatal accident once a week every single week that fatality rate would be   more than twice as safe   as human drivers

I think you  severely overestimate what it takes to be better than the average driver (https //wwwsciencedirectcom/science/article/abs/pii/0001457589900249) and just perceive a higher risk because it's a loss of control not cause it's actually riskier",

I don't like the way Tesla is treating the idea of putting full on self driving cars out there as if it's some cute little Windows update for people to try on but what matters more than anything is the actual  impact this has on human lives Straight up  if self driving overall reduces the number of vehicular fatalities and injuries   even if it causes accidents where otherwise there objectively would not have been one   it is a net positive and I fully encourage putting it out there in the safest way possible)

It's hard to get over the mental flip out with the thought that maybe the robo brain in someone's car decides to swerve for no reason and kills an innocent pedestrian but we don't react with the same blanket damnation over 'human driving' when some drunk or tired driver goes careening into someone's house and crushes someone who's sleeping in their bed The objective analysis needs to be the deciding factor Self driving can be improved; human error is much harder to govern But at the same time that also doesn't excuse a high error rate from FSD ""It will get better"" can't be an excuse if there's a net negative today",
537.0,t1_hju8xdq,"Yes if a human driver hits another human driver I suggest we ban them from driving as their algorithm is broken and should not be aloud to guide cars

We don't do that though We look at the situation and we don't generally punish people for accidents If the driver was negligent there's jail time but if someone happened to dive in the driver's path at the last minute the driver is not at fault Have to look at the issue

Beside we  do  regulate human drivers its called a drivers license

Yes and this applies here Use of Tesla's autopilot in the road currently requires a licensed driver that's the regulatory rule

Take something like adaptive cruise control a common feature in many of the current cars If there's a problem with it and the car doesn't slow down as a result of the car in front of you the driver is expected to brake himself You wouldn't expect the feature of adaptive cruise control to be banned if there's a problem with it in a Ford model You'd expect Ford to recall it and fix it If there's an accident as a result of it unless the bug was one that prevented the human from overriding the adaptive cruise control you'd expect the driver to be punished

The more advanced features of the Tesla should fall in the same category As long as the regulation is that a licensed driver is required on the wheel the licensed driver has responsibility If autopilot kills someone and the driver didn't disengage the autopilot that driver should be punished and Tesla is expected to recall the feature and fix it Unless the bug is such that it prevented the driver from disengaging autopilot in which case Tesla should be criminally responsible for negligence",

Methodology   
  
We collect the amount of miles traveled by each vehicle with Autopilot active or in manual driving based on available data we receive from the fleet and do so without identifying specific vehicles to protect privacy We also receive a crash alert anytime a crash is reported to us from the fleet which may include data about whether Autopilot was active at the time of impact To ensure our statistics are conservative we count any crash in which Autopilot was deactivated within 5 seconds before impact and we count all crashes in which the incident alert indicated an airbag or other active restraint deployed Our crash statistics are not based on sample data sets or estimates) In practice this correlates to nearly any crash at about 12 mph 20 kph) or above depending on the crash forces generated On the other hand police reported crashes from government databases are notoriously under reported by some estimates as much as 50% in large part because most minor crashes like “fender benders”) are not investigated We also do not differentiate based on the type of crash or fault For example more than 35% of all Autopilot crashes occur when the Tesla vehicle is rear ended by another vehicle) In this way we are confident that the statistics we share unquestionably show the benefits of Autopilot

0.0,t3_tozptu,"First and foremost it’s something of a logical fallacy Yes on  average  self driving cars have a lower accident rate But if you’re a safe driver you might have a lower accident rate than a self driving car Also you have control over how safely you drive Whereas in a self driving car you’re not in control of the risk factors 

Tesla is known for covering up high profile crashes with their Autopilot system You can read more on that if you’re interested",
1.0,t3_tozptu,When UAV’s first started coming out the industry behind them talked about how the elimination of pilots and their pesky human errors would make flight even safer  This has not been the case—these drones fall out the sky at an alarming rate and we’re not even close to remotely piloted commercial jets,
2.0,t3_tozptu,"accident rates are mostly a red herring fully autonomous self driving will never happen without the US government putting up enough money on road infrastructure to effectively turn roads into railroads all the rhetoric about 'accident rates' or 'precision' is a way to enforce this completely false notion of technological inevitability so that car companies can appropriate more public subsidies for private gain

it's actually very similar to how the development of 'counterforce' nuclear strategy and therefore nuclear armament escalation) hinged on the supposed inevitability of missile precision improvements which would not have been developed without the political decision to develop the arsenal for 'counterforce' in the first place",
3.0,t3_tozptu,"No cars are self driving It’s a fantasy people have convinced themselves must exist because it’s always in “the discourse” Driver assist features like lane keeping driver focus detection etc are great and save lives

What’s really going on is players like Tesla benefit immensely from the conversation about autonomous vehicles being far away from the real question of “is it a scam ” and into la la land where we debate the trolley problem and how a car should make life or death situations",
4.0,t3_tozptu,I would say self driving cars are safe to a point I still wouldn't trust a SDC with the moral quandry of preserving the life of a driver or pedestrian and having to make the choice of whether the car should or shouldn't hit a pole to avoid the pedestrians,
5.0,t1_i28byx6,"I guess what I'm interested to know is if fully automated driving became legal would the number of accidents and fatalities go up or down   It is or course impossible to know for sure which is why I was wondering if anyone has seriously tried to model/estimate it

If you have any good Tesla cover up links handy and wanna save me a few minutes feel free to post  I was under the impression though that Tesla was not at the cutting edge of self driving it's more Google and the other major car companies",

well this poor person was arrested thrown in jail and slandered after some crackhead basically ran themself into the car effectively killing themself the car company forget the name I think it was waymo) blamed it all on this poor person saying they should have been paying attention and steered away they had video from inside the car of course and the tester was just sitting there playing on their phone when suddenly out of the blue comes some person on a bike straight into the car  this happened so fast it was pretty much two seconds from when the camera sees the person on the bike to the impact this also happened at night so it is unlikely the test driver even if they weren't staring at their phone would have seen much less been able to anticipate thebike rider's actions not to mention the car had the headlights on and could clearly be seen yet the bike rider still drove immediately in front of them which to me seemed to indicate they probably weren't perceptually aware enough to understand the vehicle was closer than they were thinking it was

The one price problem is something that while I have no evidence for feel like there's a certain level of collusion to the way insurance is calculated

Why  There currently isnt a one price problem I'm saying if the government did it on a risk based approach you would only get one price Currently you can go on compare the market or whatever and gets loads of different prices Insurers will react to other insurers prices changes for lots of reasons including 

The other insurers have increased prices and so they know something we dont like wise for decreasing prices)

They are currently too competitive and dont want to take on any new business as we do not have the staffing levels to maintain a good quality of customer service similarly they may decrease prices not because the risk has decreased but because they simply want to grow the business) 

If all the insurance companies were very good at pricing the risk correctly you would expect all the prices return to be very similar but that not the case as all insurers have different target markets and business strategies They have different risk models with different risk variables going into those models",

This is the lie they tell themselves and their investors  23 million autonomous vehicles in fleets could handle the transit needs for about 230 million people  This is pretty close to the total population of the US  The article doesn't even entertain the idea that maybe SDC fleets are the future and not individually owned cars  This is probably because the insurance contacts steered away from this being a possibility at all  They realize that if this does happen there really is no insurance industry as we know it today left  The rest of the article is basically an argument for why you won't own an SDC unless you are rich and really want to

Car ownership in America is very expensive   The typical person has to go in debt for a depreciating asset  They have to pay to store it they have to pay to park it they have to pay to maintain it pay to insure it deal with registration and the DMV  For a lot of people they either pay a high monthly payment and warranty or they live in a world where serious repairs can wipe out their savings and put them in debt  

I feel the service will be like Netflix it will be drastically cheaper than actually owning the product  Early adopters may pay a premium for first access subscription and there will probably be luxury service lines for people who want higher end service and don't mind paying for it Netflix has a 4K subscription plan that is a bit more expensive)    Even if the cars are expensive the fact that its something like 1 car per 8 people make them drastically cheaper   

I think a lot of people are going to get the subscription and keep their car only they will realize they hardly ever drive anymore and keeping their car is not worth the costs associated with it  Collectors and enthusiasts may keep their cars but the average person will likely ditch them due to the fact they are expensive and obsolete

Vehicles piloted by humans and their insurance plans will have a smaller pool as the ubiquity of AVs grows which skyrockets the coefficient of variation  since median grows like O(n) and standard deviation grows with O(sqrt(n))  associated with insuring non AVs This adds a lot of risk to insurance companies making the feasibility of insuring human drivers go down

And let's be honest even if it is you footing the insurance if your car was the one driving if it's coming to a lawsuit as opposed to just damages which are routinely handled by insurance) it's the software and hardware makers they're going to be going after regardless  as they're the ones with money and unless you did something wrong they're obviously the ones at fault if such a thing exists It's important to remember not every accident has to have somebody at ""fault"" Bad shit happens sometimes

SDCs can see further and can react much faster and for the foreseeable future they're going to be adhering to driving regulations that allow for humans to be piloting cars alongside them  So trolley problems just will not occur and the situations that come closest to them will be dealt with the car bringing itself to a stop or as close to one as possible before any accidents  Taking the time for the car to figure out how many nuns can dance on the head of their radiator grille is taking time away that could be spent already bringing the car to a stop",140.0

But this isn't even the trolley problem  The original form of the trolley problem is that you have to choose between letting the trolley kill n people but it's not your fault or switching tracks so it will kill 1 person but you did it At its heart it's a question about acts of commission  vs  omission blame and liability and it's been the core of the auto industry's approach to driver assist for at least the last 40 years probably longer

The corresponding dilemma for the auto industry is this  say you have a new emergency braking system that prevents some percentage of fatal accidents   so if you deployed it in all new cars it would save x lives per year But it's not a perfect system so sometimes it might brake or swerve unnecessarily costing y lives per year But the x deaths that happen if you do nothing are not your fault   or as the legal system works you're not liable for them   whereas the y deaths that might happen would definitely leave the manufacturer liable

In a perfect world maybe the choice of whether to ship the system would be whether x  y Maybe you'd take into account some other factors   like it would make people drive more recklessly endangering more lives that you hadn't accounted for; or the deaths caused by the system are more or less traumatic for drivers That could be an interesting moral discussion but the auto industry's solution to this is that you only ship the system if y = 0 They're quite happy for drivers to kill any number of people with their cars so long as the manufacturer isn't liable The number one phrase used by people who write safety critical software for the legacy auto industry is ""But what if it makes it crash into a bus full of lawyers' children "" That's why the first AEB systems only started braking after the driver did and it's why the idea of robotaxis   where there's no driver to shift liability to   is so disruptive to the industry

If you are on a high way and something falls off of a truck blocking your lane and you have an empty shoulder to your side I find it hard to justify not swerving into the shoulder if the braking distance is too short    


Similarly if you are driving down a residential road and a child runs out into the road I expect the majority of the public to agree that the vehicle should attempt to avoid hitting the kid even if it ends with the vehicle hitting a parked car   


I don't think we will see cars getting to the point where they need to reason between very particular classes ie hit the nun vs the child  The chances of these decisions coming up are rather low   But I do think that we will see vehicles classify the occupancy grid around them as empty space person vehicle collidable object  and non collidable object

Because you keep going forward even when you brake Even if you were to immediately crush the wheel by pressing relentlessly hard on it the wheels aren't attached to the road so it's still going to skid The idea of swerving is to redirect that momentum at a safer target

I don't think the situations are as complicated as people make them out to be These cars will have a much greater situation awareness than any human If something unexpected enough happens that causes a crash then you can hardly blame the SDC The car's core logic doesn't have to be any more complicated than swerve if a reasonable open area is available otherwise break So for instance if the car detected a cliff to one side or pedestrians or an oncoming vehicle in its potential escape path it would just break

 However on appeal the court ruled that the jury should be able to decide whether based on the facts and circumstances of this case and the characteristics of this child Ted could be held to have been negligent

However this brings up another important point None of this is unique to SDCs The legal system has already developed laws and rules for dealing with these cases Presumably these laws and rules are considered the right thing to do in such circumstances and automated cars will be able to carry out that expected behavior better than any human could  

The only issue I can see is when the law makes a distinction between the correct action based on some criteria that a SDC can't determine For instance if the law was to say that you should crash your car into another car if it was a child in the way but hit the pedestrian if they were an adult then that would cause a problem if the car could not determine the age of the pedestrian I'm no lawyer but I have a hard time believing such an interpretation of the law would be correct Regardless of the child's tort liability there has to be a presumptive defense that a driver doesn't have to endanger their life by getting into a head on crash in order to protect a child",223.0

As I pointed out in another comment none of these issues are unique to SDCs and already have a body of laws and litigation dictating what the correct course of action should be If a car is programmed to follow those standards then there shouldn't be ant problems 

The issue is that people have a problem specifically deciding that a specific innocent person should be injured over another ahead of the fact They are much more comfortable with such decisions being made in the heat of the moment by a human being because you can more easily sweep it under the rug as just being an accident That's harder to accept when the decision was made years ahead of time on a computer somewhere",230.0

Likewise a pedestrian on the side of the road could jump out into the road at any time too Traffic isn't going to slow down because someone might jump into the street However children are an exception to this rule Most people will be more cautious around children A possible issue with SDCs could be that they might not be able to classify moving objects into categories fine enough to distinguish an adult from a child

Even if that is the case the superior sensors of a car should be able to make up the difference They'll be better at some things like not having blind spots or being distracted They'll be worse at others like not being able to recognize a situation developing that would cause a person to suddenly run into the road like for example another person about to throw them a ball Taken as a whole though between the better sensors and reaction time SDCs should be much safer",232.0

so the car coming the other way WILL ALSO SEE YOU

the two cars will coordinate with each other share data they will BOTH SEE YOU

it will weight your existence as a probability and what it think you COULD DO and constantly dozens of not hundreds of times a second RE SEE YOU RE MEASURE YOU and RE PREDICT what it thinks you will do and SO WILL THE OTHER CAR

when you move the cars will already be ""acting"" before your foot gets 6 inches into the road BOTH Cars will automatically begin to ""act""

if they can brake they will brake if they must ""swerve"" the car that was to hit you will swerve to miss you and coordinate with the other car to also swerve so it does not head on the other SDC

this will all happen at CPU CYCLE SPEEDS so insanely fast it will be like ""the flash"" or ""superman"" casually walking around at superspeed while the slow beings you) move around like molasses slow and easy to predict

it really can be THAT GOOD

you would have to get pretty damned creative to trick on

SDC's will do what drives like me do but on a whole new level of ""insane""

EADD Extremely aggressive defensive driving part of this driving is being proactive about POSSIBLE dangers

for example doing everything you can to avoid getting ""INTO"" a situation where you do not have 2 outs available at all times 2 directions you can ""go"" to avoid some trouble)

seeing a possible hey what if this guy does this or that situations and proactively ""changing"" your circumstances in advance even if he does nothing so that ""IF HE DOES"" your position to alter or avoid is improved

,t1_cpy4ak0,"I have a good true story to describe this

I was driving home from egg harbor almost 60 mile drive home from work brother wanted me to drop him off so the expressway made more sense than 206 since I would have to backtrack once in PA to get to his place while if I took the express way he was ""on the way"" and would get home faster hell as long as he is paying the toll fine by me

We are chugging down the expressway I am doing 60 in the right lane 65mph PSL)

this road has HUGE arching onramps

so I see a car ahead on the onramp I slow down a little and then more when I check my six

brother asks why I am slowing down I take the opportunity to explain my EADD driving to him

I say see that onramp car  he is going to be an intercept we will arrive at merge at the same time) see the car passing me now  he would have intercepted as well if I did


SLAM on the brakes swerve hard left behind the passing driver still max braking take the shoulder and prepare still max braking to dive into the grass median if I need to Brother bounces off the door window and slams into his loose restraints and goes WTF

I just point forward

Now here is what happened when the onramp car arrived at the straight away WHAM 3 deer standing in the lane he aggressively swerves left into the right lane to avoid the deer BARELY missing the passing guy who just passed us

PRECISELY where my little geo metro would have been had I not preemptively predicted NOT that this would happen but that ""IF SOMETHING DID HAPPEN"" that spot is where I did not want to be it would have been a geo sandwich between those two much larger heavier cars it would not have been a good night if we even would have survived it

I would have had zero outs I would not be able to go right as that would be into the merging car I would not have been able to go left as that would be into the passing car its a 49hp 3cylinder geo metro in 5th gear ""go faster"" is non existant in any useful time frame and braking would not have been sufficient in that timescale

0 outs the only way to secure outs was toe CHANGE the odds slow down now so I am not BETWEEN the cars at the single most dangerous point the merge point

so I planned in advance by slowing to let them arrive ahead of me by checking at all to even notice the guy on my six passing me 

to check ahead that the shoulder and median are clear in case I need to use them

do it long enough and this all just happens instinctively in your subconscious you just ""do it"" without thinking so much about it when you do it long enough

AND SDC with its perfect memory scanning and raw SPEED and higher resolution sensors and no distractions can do this so much faster than ANY person can and do it FURTHER AND FURTHER away into the future AND coordinate with other cars

ideally in an SDC environment my car would slow and so would the passing car so that we would all reach the merge point ""staggered"" slightly without us the passengers even realizing it

even if they all drive perfectly what if something happens their sensors can not see tire blows out causing a car to swerve anything

EADD programming would solve this and we would never even know

BTW the passing car  never flinched either he had depleted uranium balls or he never even SAW anything and never knew how close he came to being whacked by that car swerving to miss the deer",272.0

if you are reacting at the last second NO swerving will usually not help you just brake as best you can

it is interesting to note that when ABS brakes came out rear end collisions when down but head on and other collisions went up

before you would slam on the brakes swerve but still go straight because you were sliding

ABS retained wheel grip control so you were able to swerve and get whacked another way because you had no idea where you were swerving into",277.0

,t3_8vsy7n,I guess they’re waymo ahead of everyone else ,287.0
,t3_8vsy7n,"Waymo is ahead because Google wanted to do this over 10 years ago  They have had it on their mind as they build all their other stuff

So today Google has more data of the physical world than anyone else that they can leverage   They know when there is an accident with Waze  They know when there is a traffic jam  They can see the traffic light patterns and when the pattern changes  They can see the data where there is a stop sign or even a stop sign has been removed

Waymo is using a database the cars drive from  So if the database indicates a stop sign they stop  They do not have to see the stop sign but if the database indicates a stop sign and there is non that they see they create an exception that is logged and the situation is looked into  But Google can also verify what is happening by using the human driver behavior that they get through Google Maps and Google Waze

They know if a protest closes a road in real time  If a parade  They even know how busy a store is at a particular time   They know when the stores open and close

Google has built up their data in prepartion for the data for self driving car robot taxi service and having far better utilization than anyone else

But not just the data   Google has the infrastructure to support  You need the ability to handle lots of data coming in make sense of it and get events to cars in real time   Sound familiar 

Ultimately self driving cars is a software engineering problem   Google attracts the top engineers in the world  So they basically get more first round draft choices than anyone

Once the cream of the crop comes in and is hire they then can take the cream of the crop of the cream of the crop and send them to Waymo

Google created a virtual California that they can inject diffrent situations  This is just vital for doing automated testing  I have ZERO clue how GM/Ford/Uber and the others are doing this

I suspect they just are not   Why I can't see them getting to a safe solution

You are making software and model changes  You need to be sure that your change is not breaking something else  You need to be able to first do virtual testing

There is just so many other factors that favor Google/Waymo than just being the only ones that have it working without safety drivers

Google has $100B in the bank for example with less than $4B debt  They could buy GM and have plenty left over if they wanted to

The piece Google/Waymo is missing and nobody has is the car durability data   Today taxi companies buy ""regular"" cars  They are not optimized for using as a taxi

Waymo will now collect data like there has never been before on the cars and that data will drive improvement in durability well beyond cars of today  That will enable them to drive down the cost of self driving cars robot taxi service to be cheaper than using your own car within 15 years

Ultimately Waymo will use that data to build cars as it will ultimately be a competitive advantage

But they should buy cars until they get the data gathered and then they should buy car making expertise and NOT do it organically

Then there is an entirely different angles that Google has advantageous that nobody is close at having   Right now 5 of the top 7 apps used on all smart phones are owned by Google

https //enwikipediaorg/wiki/List_of_most_popular_smartphone_apps

GM Ford Honda combined do NOT have a single one     So there is discovery to summon a car   Google is unmatched in this area  No other company close  So you type ""car"" into search and a car shows up  Or you add a calendar event and you get a pop up ""do you need a car""    You write an email to get dinner with a friend next week and you both get a pop up ""do you need a car""    I saw a stat recently that new email accounts today are more than 90% going to Gmail  They now have over 15 billion active accounts

But it is not only on your phone   Google in the smart speaker space has moved ahead of Amazon even thought getting to the market 2 years later

""Move over Amazon Echo Google Home now sits upon the smart speaker throne""

https //wwwdigitaltrendscom/home/google home most popular speaker/

So you with Google you can just be in your house and say ""car now"" and a car shows up  GM/Ford/Honda do NOT have smart speakers

Honestly never understood how any of this could be debated  It is not like it is close

Now I am someone that does NOT believe people will be buying self driving cars   Does not make any sense to me  That is people thinking the old world

I also do NOT believe Level 5 will happen for decades and possibly not in my life time  We have NO idea how to do it  It will not be as safe as Level 4   But there is probably not the financial benefits to spend the billions to do Level 5  Ultimately it comes down to money

We have no idea the processing power that would be required to do Level 5  It might be we are a long way from having the silicon to support

I think it is far more likely Level 4 rolled out like you would roll out cell service  Area by area with the ones that make you the most money first  With self driving cars it will also be driven by government regulation

You can get to 80% coverage in probably the next 10 years with level 4   You will then connect city to city  So you do Phoenix and do Tuscon and then you do the highways inbetween   Eventually you are covering most of the US

BTW the confusion with Level 5 is caused by Musk  He is way smarter than I and knows better   He says things that are simply ridiculous   Then people believe them  The one I find most funny is having the hardware to do Level 5

We do NOT have the algorithms to do level 5 so the idea of having the silicon to support is absurd   How can you know that if we do not have algorithms

You're right SDCs wouldnt need the external devices you mentioned However the car interior and exterior will be a brand new playground Cars could be giant pods with couches and TVs inside or moving offices Etc


GM/Ford have the factories in place to design and develop this stuff My roommate is an engineer who works solely for a big automaker seating They spend millions on seat durability and safety testing for new style vehicles and could fairly easily continue to shift production to new age seating Waymo will have to partner with other parties which is expensive can lead to compatibility issues and will lose the integrated efficiency of big auto 

Lastly GM/Ford depend on this market Like this is literally their only play Google is going I to a million different directions I think we are going to underestimate their focus

But to this day Google has never charged a penny for the use of any of their IP   Not a single penny  They get patents so nobody else does  But not to use them as a weapon

That is more Microsoft MO  So for example MS gets paid over $5 for every Android phone sold with patent royalties  Versus it is Google IP and they do not charge a cent

""Why Microsoft Makes $5 to $15 From Every Android Device Sold""

Now with that said  There is only one time that Google/Waymo has even tried to protect IP and that was the suit with Uber over the theft of trade secrets and believe patent infringement or something similar was involved

Plus Google shared almost all their IP through papers and software   So things like Map/reduce GFS BigTable Borg/Omega with Kubernettes and much of what runs everyones cloud came from Google with IP they just patented and then gave away and never charged a cent for   Same with Backrub and later renamed PageRank but that patents is technically owned by Stanford  But anyone can use and why we have other search engines

But we can see Waymo has NOT yet given away any IP  I mean none  I monitor papers out of Google closely as they usually become the standard way to do things in the tech world and NOTHING from Waymo

The only thing I would add and might be the most important is Google/Waymo took a realistic approach   Or might call it good enough or say a Level 4 approach   They are NOT trying to do level 5   

Google is a very good engineering organization and able to do incredible stuff but they did NOT take an approach that was beyond what is possible to do in a reasonable time  There were much more ""fun"" approaches that could have been taken  More futuristic  Ones that required far far less manual work  I so appreciate this aspect of Google  It is very easy to let yourself get ahead of yourself and loose perspective of what is actually possible and what is dreaming   Yes do some dreaming but maybe more reasonable dreaming ;)

We use to have these slot cars when I was a kid   Then there was these cars that did not need slots that were much harder to control

Google is using a slot car approach with the map being the slot and then taking exceptions of what is expected on a per case basis  It is a very manual thing   You could say it is much more controlled

They are NOT taking a ""human"" approach where you could plop the car down anywhere and it would figure out how to drive

All the level 5 stuff from Musk is honestly silly talk   We do NOT have the algorithms to do level 5   We are not even close   If Musk had them in secret those same algorithms would be used for many other things than just self driving and would be used    I would also expect they would have been shared as the AI community is a community that shares breakthroughs

The other aspect that is critical with Maps and Waze is that it brings real time data from humans that can be used and even trained from to a certain extent

So if all the humans are stopping somewhere and visually it does not make sense for the Waymo car you probably should be stopping and definitely being careful   But Google can see stops signs that humans blow through  They get accidents in real time to avoid   That is with Waze

They get real time traffic events  Or a parade Or a protest  Basically they have many millions of phones giving them the data of humans moving around in real time  But they are the only ones with this data

Google has been doing it for over a decade and already knows how and has the technology to leverage  GM or Ford or whoever struggles to create a decent infotainment system

The answer is nobody knows  I am old an quit trying to predict how such things will play out in share price

Instead I look at things that will have strong growth and have faith everything else will work out

I believe SDC is a trillion dollar a year opportunity and will take decades to get there  SO it is  about as ideal as you can get for something to fuel growth for a very long time  

Google has now had over 20% growth for the last 10 quarters  They will need fuel in a couple of years to keep that going   Look out 4 years from now when they have $250B of revenue  They will need $50B of revenue growth

,t1_dkw2bhn,"While I agree with the above post that the average age of a car in the US is 12 years that doesn't mean it will remain that way as the symbiotic relationship between SDCs and electric cars are relaized  You can buy a Chevy Bolt today for less than $30k and it will cost you about $4500/year for depreciation + Electric + Insurance + Maintenance(Tires)  A new ICE car will cost closer to $9k/year because of gas and higher maintenance but outside of a Tesla electric is still a hard sell because consumers are unsure how it will workout for them

As SDCs are rolled out as a service it's much easier for a consumer to dip their toes into the electric car pool since they aren't committing to a huge capital investment  As consumers decide that an SDC fleet works for them as their 2nd or 3rd car and for some all their cars the average age of cars on the road should fall pretty fast as the 2nd and 3rd cars are mostly where these older cars are  Each car you own has to justify you spending $6k $9k/year on them when you can spend $1k $2k/year using an SDC fleet

Try this  First figure up how much each of your cars cost you per year by calculating the depreciation gas costs insurance costs maintenance taxes etc  This should be between $6k $9k even if you have a 14 year old beater like I do  Then ask yourself if you would keep paying this if you had an Uber like service where you could request and have a car in your driveway within  2 minutes that would take you anywhere in town for $2  Would you keep your car ",393.0

Most of the arguments made for self driving cars are also arguments for much stronger public transportation networks in urban cities and intercity rail networks for connecting those cities  All technology that is quite well proven not controversial incredibly safe  and relatively inexpensive  

The self driving advocates are starting to push the shared ownership model because it is becoming increasingly apparent that self driving cars will not be deliverable at unit costs of less than 7 figures  They're trying to in any way possible rationalize the high cost of a self driving vehicle to support further public equity market funding of self driving car research in the context of the lack of an otherwise viable business case  

BTW maintenance costs on a car are largely a function of miles driven and are almost certainly to be dramatically greater for self driving cars due to the extra required redundancy safety systems and the ""life critical"" nature of their components  Insurance costs are highly correlated to miles driven  Long term interest rates are low so there is little downside to low capital intensity and cars are cheaper than ever    those worried about capital intensity can simply buy cheaper cars

I agree government could step in and completely kill everything  It's why we can't have nice things  My main hope here is that they will be so behind the curve that they won't add a lot of tax to it until enough people have switched and they will be politically unable to do so  The only data point to give me hope is that ALL the car manufactures are on board and don't seem to be lobbying that I know of to kill SDCs in the cradle

,t3_tpqxva,"I don't believe we'll see FSD reaching L4 and I don't think we're going to see any of the AV companies get to L5 for a very long time But for different reasons than your post I do see FSD reaching L3 on pre validated stretches of road

I've been following FSD for about a year now and your write up today demonstrates progress 12 months ago the typical post mortem reddit post would have listed far more safety disengagements on the same amount of mileage

I don't feel that the non safety disengagements you listed are reasons to doubt FSD's foundations Standardized conditional speed limit signage and contextual hand gesture recognition are both within the realm of possibility to be programmed into a computer today My guess is that Tesla has their efforts focused on more fundamental aspects of FSD that have more unknowns such as their vision only perception

We do know that the perception engine is capable of perceiving unclassified obstacles in the road though the visualization doesn't show them anymore I do not know what kinds of work they've done to be able to classify objects as being safe to drive over   but again this isn't really an unsolvable problem and doesn't require human judgement

So I'm not really convinced by your first or second point They're fighting an uphill battle with their comically under powered sensor suite yet I'm impressed with how far they've managed to get with it Yes their vision only system does have a big error margin but it doesn't need to be tightened much further to make it suitable for a lot of driving

I don't see FSD reaching L4 until they do the following 

1 fully embrace high fidelity mapping
2 implement a teleguidance system that can loop a human in when human judgement is required
3 double their compute power to offer full redundancy
4 add sensor redundancy and improve sensor positioning

However; even if they do not do these things I feel that the system could one day be capable of L3 driving on pre validated roads; particularly closed access roads and highways IMO this would be great to have on a personally owned vehicle",1.0

  First the fact that it's being built entirely from fairly low resolution images alone means its accuracy is at least moderately suspect from the beginning Again great tech demo—it's impressive they can even do that much But it's not enough when lives are at stake Every demo I've seen including Green's) bears a pretty tenuous connection to the car's actual surroundings I  might  trust it to keep me away from curbs and other cars but certainly not to avoid a shards of broken glass for instance Both the accuracy and spatial resolution are   way   too low
  Second it doesn't change the ontological problem here—the system simply needs far more contextual understanding and common sense knowledge than it likely has to make intelligent inferences from what it sees whether it's pixels voxels or both The system may know a ""flickering cluster of giant cubes"" is 15 feet ahead of my bumper but what exactly does that mean  Is it safe or not  This is a question about facts of the world—physics materials causality etc—not mere geometry
  Third even building a genuinely accurate voxel map would require more ontological awareness than the system appears to have In other words the process is circular just as it is in the human visual cortex)  we use depth cues to recognize the objects in front of us then use our understanding of those objects to refine and disambiguate those depth cues and repeat the process until we achieve a stable view of our surroundings The process doesn't just go in one direction so ""feeding in"" a rough pass of voxel estimation is only a first step Many iterative steps remain

Waymos can be driverless because 

  their sensor suite and compute have sufficient redundancy
  they are capable of querying for human judgement when needed teleguidence)
  their geofence is thoughally mapped and validated by humans

The last point is very important FSD without a geofence must posses human comprehension to understand complex signs and weird roads and intersections However if you constrain your operational domain to a set of mapped and validated roads you can ensure that all of the special signs in that area are programmed into the computer before it leaves the depot

Basically my point is  you cannot teach a computer to think But if you give the computer the right constraints you can do all of the ""thinking"" for it up front

So I think Tesla _could_ accomplish L3 on pre validated stretches of roads with only incremental levels of improvement they would also benefit from some better sensor placement)

But for Tesla to accomplish L4 meaning a human doesn't need to be in the driver's seat) they'd have to adopt many of the ""constraints"" that Elon likes to give shit to robo taxi companies about So the Tesla robo taxi future where your car generates hundreds of thousands of dollars for you while you sit at home probably won't be happening; at least with anything that looks like a Tesla today",23.0

  As to why Uber isnt accepting responsibility thats because our entire culture is litigious and should they admit fault they open themselves up to crippling lawsuits that could potentially end their autonomous taxi service which since they have actually done nothing worse than any other new technology including their peers) would be excessive we really cannot expect every brand new technology to have a 100% perfect fatality free rate and punish every company that fails that by suing them into oblivion but that us the way our current legal and media system works) It could even destroy their company So they cant admit fault

,t1_epnfi4i,"If your car crashes you're at fault unless you have someone else to blame the crash on Like if someone else drove the car then they are at fault Unless they have someone else to blame it on Like if the crash only happened because the brakes on the car failed then the brake company is at fault unless they have someone else to blame Like if the car owner installed the brakes incorrectly then the owner is at fault unless they have someone to blame like if the installation instructions gave bad directions

Fault is a very fluid thing A self driving vehicle doesn't add anything unique

If a SDC crashes it is the owner's problem Unless they have someone that they can blame That could be the tire company for faulty tires or the SDC software company for faulty software

But now the SDC software only has to perform as well as the promise for them to avoid fault Like if you drive a car a billion miles without changing tires and the tires fail causing a crash you can't blame the tire company because you already drove beyond what they promised you when you bought the tires

So SDCs are going to be the same You get what is promised

If they fuck up what they promised you can sue them and win money If they fuck up stuff they never promised it is your problem

The only meaningful question is ""how much will SDCs promise "" Be that in 5 years or 10 or 100",160.0

That’s a bit of a stretch A Corolla can adjust its cruise to maintain distance to the car in front and it has a limited lane maintenance system but if you tried to just let the car steer itself it would bounce from side to side until the angle was sharp enough and then it would cross the line I wouldn’t consider that “half ass driving itself” if you’re still having to steer the car just to stay in the lane",175.0

Tesla’s self driving stuff has only been around since 2015 and there are a lot of open cases against them about autopilot enabled accidents It seems premature to say that car manufactures never ever under any circumstances have any liability whatsoever for a malfunctioning ADS when we’re only 7 years in to the technology being introduced",184.0

 In what they argue is a case of New York law not keeping up with technology legislators are pushing to change a 1971 measure that requires drivers to keep at least one hand on the steering wheel while the vehicle is in motion

 They argue the law will not only stymie the introduction of automated driving systems that are already in the works but could also ensnare drivers who use parking assist features now offered in some models

 Audi brought one of its prototype vehicles to Albany last week but could not put the technology into operation because of the state&#039;s law
