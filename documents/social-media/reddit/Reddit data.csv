She was trying to make the argument that overall they are safer - basically saying that while they do cause accidents/kill people, the rate of incident has been shown to be lower than that of human driven cars.  And she is of course right that in the US tens of thousands of people die every year from car accidents.  My only response was that any research done comparing the incident rates of automated vs manually driven cars was probably done or funded by companies that are making self driving cars, i.e. entities with an invested interest in the results.  So, I am curious what that research has been done in this regard and what if any useful conclusions can we draw?"

The article looks at Waymo and their current team -- Waymo currently has standby drivers for safety precautions, who will eventually be removed, but also a hazard team (software engineers) to deal with operational issues.

With self-driving cars, drivers are no longer available to troubleshoot road problems (jams, fallen trees on roads, etc.) in person, and so this low-cost additional ""service"" now has to be separately provided by either AI or support staff. It seems clear that the support staff (inclusive of tech support) will be more expensive on a per person basis for now, *however* self-driving eliminates the baseline of driver labor cost, such that eventual advances in driving and support AIs will reduce marginal cost.

FT provided no support in the article for how it will be more expensive overall.

1. Cars are responsible for climate change. [The transportation sector accounts for 29% of all global emissions, and personal cars account for 58% of that proportion,](https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/fast-facts-transportation-greenhouse-gas-emissions#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Inventory%20of,U.S.%20GHG%20emissions%20in%202019.) roughly **17% of all global CO2 emissions.**

2. Cars are dangerous. [Vehicle collisions kill 1.35 million per year globally.](https://www.cdc.gov/injury/features/global-road-safety/index.html#:~:text=Each%20year%2C%201.35%20million%20people,on%20roadways%20around%20the%20world.&text=Every%20day%2C%20almost%203%2C700%20people,bicycles%2C%20trucks%2C%20or%20pedestrians.)

3. Cars pollute our air. They put a layer of smog over our cities and dump exhaust onto those outside of a car. Pollution from exhaust [is responsible for thousands of direct deaths](https://theicct.org/new-study-quantifies-the-global-health-impacts-of-vehicle-exhaust/), and it damages our health in numerous ways.

4. Cars are expensive. [The bottom 20% of income-earners in the U.S. pay 29% percent of their earnings towards transportation.](https://www.itdp.org/2019/05/23/high-cost-transportation-united-states/#:~:text=The%20lowest%20income%20is%20burdened,(lack%20of\)%20transport%20system.) This proportion is only 7.5% in the EU, where public transportation is more accessible.

5. Car infrastructure is an excessive waste of space. [Parking lots are costly to build and maintain](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2018/11/20/the-many-costs-of-too-much-parking), and they contribute to the housing crisis. In the U.S., [there are 8 parking spaces per every car, about the size of West Virginia](https://youtu.be/Akm7ik-H_7U)

What's the solution?

1. Invest in public transit. 

2. Invest in cycling infrastructure. 

3. Promote housing reform so that cities are more dense and walkable. Promote mixed-use zoning so that commutes are shorter distances.

4. Abolish mandatory parking minimums

5. End subsidies for automobiles and fossil fuels, once viable alternatives for transportation are available.

4,Pittsylvania County Court blatantly refuses to uphold new protections regarding eviction,19,meunxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Virginia/comments/meunxm/pittsylvania_county_court_blatantly_refuses_to/,8,1616906598.0,"These protections were put in place in November 2020 and are meant to protect those of us who have lost wages due to the coronavirus from being evicted.  I got behind at the end of last year during the time that my unemployment was only paying $150 a week, its very hard living on $600 month and I commend those on fixed incomes who have to make that much stretch all the time 😢  On Jan 25 I sent my landlord the CDC exemption letter that I was told would protect me.  On the very same day the land lord went and got an eviction notice served on me.  On the day of court it was allowed to stand and a writ was issued.  Luckily the officer did not make me leave once I gave him a copy of the letter (which the landlord now claimed they'd never received but I showed the officer proof of emailing it and then the landlord writing back referring to it.

Twice I've written and asked the landlord to adhere to the new protections that say he must offer me a payment plan to which he has refused or actually has just not answered at all since email is my only means of communication and he refuses to answer my calls.  So I entered a motion to rehear asking the judge to rehear the case.  I was told by the clerk when filing the motion it would be me and the judge and my counsel (I have been working with legal aid) couldn't come and the landlord didn't have to be served as they didn't need to be there.  So imagine my surprise when on the day of court my landlord is present AND has a lawyer present.  When i ask why they are there when i was assured this wasn't that type of case the judge became extremely rude to me and remained that way for the remainder of the time, once even jumping on me for clearing my throat while the landlords attorney was speaking..IT WAS AN AMBUSH!  So of course I lost the motion which leaves my only option now to appeal to circuit which costs me putting up all the money i owe plus court cost.

Now for a little back story....this home belongs to me it is simply on their property.  It's a fifth wheel RV that has been put on foundation and built around. (Another fact that was overlooked at the hearing as the eviction was done as if the landlord owned the home) When i bought the place i asked the owners was there any racial issues and I was assured there was not.  However imagine my surprise when my black boyfriend, biracial son and I drive around and see nearly all the 150 other lots have rebel flags hanging and they are the only people of color in the entire 97 acre place.  We've had issue after issue with the management over things that are blatantly racially motivated.  The management has also tried to self evict twice by turning off our power which is illegal and by making threats to us in the way of calling the police to hassel us and they are just as racist and ignorant as the entire rest of the county.

So what do you do when the law isn't on your side when it should be on your side and the only money you have is the 2k you've saved up to catch up the rent in the event someone actually obeys the laws so I cant afford a paid lawyer...it looks like I will lose it all and yet another racial injustice will go unchecked

By the way I should also add that the ignorant judge who admitted to being ignorant to the new laws was screwing people in court left and right who were asking for protections under the CDC rules so it wasn't just me it was literally everyone...the whole court was a joke"

[Congress Just Signed ""The Four-Wheeled Patriot Act""](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-09-08/congress-just-signed-four-wheeled-patriot-act), Zerohedge 9/8/2017

Leading argument from the article is, ""Whenever Congress does something unanimously (or nearly so) *you can rest assured it’s in their interests, not ours.* ... This is the law that exempts *automated* cars from the safety requirements that apply to *autonomous* cars – that is, the cars which are independent of government control and controlled by us.""

Article is in regard to the ""Safely Ensuring Lives Future Deployment and Research in Vehicle Evolution Act"", or '[SELF DRIVE Act](https://energycommerce.house.gov/selfdrive/)'. Went looking for additional coverage from Ars Technica, Techdirt, similar sources but could not locate anything. News articles I've been able to locate don't go into depth of analysis I'd hope for. 

Skimming through seeing if I can find source documents and better assess the sensationalism in the article.

---
Edit: Actual bill (headed for Senate) is here, [SELF DRIVE Act, H.R. 3388](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3388/text)

Skimming through commenting on things of note.

* Takes away rights from States to pass regulations regarding design, construction, or performance of automated vehicles

* Cybersecurity of automated driving systems restricts manufacturers from selling products unless meeting certain standards. Item 3) is ""A process for limiting access to the self driving system"". This strikes me as providing the backing of federal regulatory power to limit the ability of product owners to work on their purchases equipment (see farmers struggle with John Deere, using copyright and locking down system in a way to make farmers dependent on service agreements. At what point do you no longer 'own' but only allowed to 'rent'?). Other end is that locking down access only makes the products less secure by barring independent security researchers from being able to audit the code, rip it apart and find security flaws that must be fixed. This system must be open to scrutiny or critical failings will exist causing harm far longer than necessary. Look to groups frequently finding creative flaws in vehicle automation systems to unlock. If there's a flaw, it will be found. Speed up that process.

* Requires rear seat occupant alert system. Anyone know the intent here? Is this an existing requirement in vehicles on the market? Assuming possibly related to air bags in the rear seats of the vehicle. 

* Requires manufacturer develop a privacy plan available to the customer. Looks like offloading the burden of thought onto the creativity of the manufacturer to load everything into Terms of Service, signing away every right in return to use the product. The standard Facebook model of Terms and Conditions. Posted actual language below for review. Obligatory recommended viewing for the documentary ""[Terms and Conditions May Apply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzDgBITDaRY)"".

> (1) A written privacy plan with respect to the collection, use, sharing, and storage of information about vehicle owners or occupants collected by a highly automated vehicle, vehicle that performs partial driving automation, or automated driving system. Such policy shall include the following:

> (A) The practices of the manufacturer with respect to the way that information about vehicle owners or occupants is collected, used, shared, or stored.

> (B) The practices of the manufacturer with respect to the choices offered to vehicle owners or occupants regarding the collection, use, sharing, and storage of such information.

> (C) The practices of the manufacturer with respect to the data minimization, de-identification, and retention of information about vehicle owners or occupants.

> (D) The practices of the manufacturer with respect to extending its privacy plan to the entities it shares such information with.

* ""(4) If information about an occupant is anonymized or encrypted the manufacturer is not required to include the process or practices regarding that information in the privacy policy."" - So if a company uses the weakest forms of encryption, or are lazy about anonymizing data ""there, I deleted the names column! anonymized!"", there is no requirement to inform the public how this process is taking place. That will lead to information collected neither anonymized or secure.

* Federal Trade Commission to provid enforcement of violations of the privacy policies.

Returning to the Zerohedge article, it builds out from the argument that automated vehicles are a means to limit a publics freedom of movement by a government. Imagine a revolutionary force trying to operate in a country without vehicles under independent control, if the means of transportation can be immediately turned off by the government in power that fight ends quickly. On the less radical considerations we have the ongoing domestic spying program that has wrapped itself around western societies. There is a discomfort with this idea in that once that control has been mandated, how does one erode it and return to independent freedoms?

At the core here what stands out to me is the big issue not getting enough attention - who owns data? What rights do individuals have to the data generated by their works or activities? Many of the abuses and mind numbingly stupid headlines we see today (see Equifax) are simplified by observing a publics **Right-to-Data**. **1) The individual gets final say regarding how their data is used, and shared, requiring explicit sign-off for those uses. 2) The individual holds the right to retract authorization for use of that data generated by them at any time.** These are modern privacy rights that really need to be fought over and amended into the US Constitution to observe the inherent rights of man in a modern age. Without this many of those already enshrined have been undermined and weakened, contorted into pretzels no longer recognizable.

So who do we trust? Zerohedge has a point in the current environment there is no shortage of examples of US government pushing bills saying ""no, just trust us. we left these parts vague and there are concerns but we'll shore that up and add detail later."" then lawyers are employed to maximize the size of the trailer that can by driven through those massive holes in the language. 

Automated driving is an incredible technology to bring to the world, but there needs to be careful thought and be wary of these systems becoming mandated. Now is the time to be wary and guard against autonomous driving becoming somehow ""illegal"" or infrastructure non-existent.

---

**TL;DR - This is a complex issue with significant pitfalls, bill is silent on many of these. In a time when political parties pull no punches trying to tear one another to pieces it's downright weird to get a unanimous vote on an issue. Who's getting screwed?**"

3,A rant on my marketing class,20,2208h9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption/comments/2208h9/a_rant_on_my_marketing_class/,10,1396439500.0,"So, as a new accounting major, I'm forced to take Intro to Marketing.  Normally this would be fine, if we were covering stuff like how to make appealing packaging, how to collect and use data, and other methods of self-fluffing and deception.  Sometimes I read academic articles like that just for fun, because the psychology behind it is interesting. However, the class reads like an enormous immersion in propaganda.  

Every example is about companies and brands.  We are constantly asked things like, ""Name me a brand of soda!"" or ""Name me a jingle from a commercial!"" during lecture.  ""You've seen that commercial such-and-such?""  (Which I haven't.  No commercials, ever.)  He spends a long time on this.  He could just say, ""Brand X soda does --"".  Instead he spends ten minutes talking about Coke and Pepsi and their latest commercials.  I get that we need examples.  However, he approaches it like buying the crap is the norm.  ""We want new things, we don't want old stuff, we always want what is best on the market.  It costs more, but it's better."" 

When discussing early adopters versus not, ""I'm a laggard,"" said the prof.  ""I buy a new car and own it for ten years before selling it.  I already paid it off, so no bills!""  Like, no.  No.  He just assumes that normal is buying a new car every year or two.  In my family, no one has ever owned a vehicle newer than fifteen years.  We buy used.  Even if I were a millionaire, I'd buy a used car.  Buying new cars is for suckers, because half the value evaporates when you drive it off the lot. But apparently he's a damn hippie for keeping the brand new car he bought around for a while.  

He's also fairly misogynist.  ""Got to keep the women appeased.  Have to buy [crap] to keep the wife happy."" On discussing national grocery chains, ""We want consistency, especially women.  You want to go to the store and buy the same product as back home, don't you, ladies? They don't want to change their behavior.""  Like, excuse me?  Why especially women?  His phrasing was a bit different and it was in the delivery, but I felt like he was saying women were idiots and little babies who needed their McPackaged Food to be exactly the same every time.  Like, I don't even eat anything prepackaged.  I go to the store and get some apples.  No two apples are identical.  He's said similar before.  Basically, in his world view, women are obsessed with cooking and with fashion, and we can't make informed decisions and merely buy the thing with the pink packaging.  He gave us a nice tale of when his wife thought they needed a new water heater.  He paid a repairman to take a look at it, and it was fine.  But his wife was acting neurotic so he bought a new heater because, apparently, a dumb little woman can't comprehend that the repairman, who makes his living knowing about this shit, said the heater was fine.  Well, that would just be too much for her little head. He speaks like every woman is like that.  I think he even said once that women make judgements based on emotion.  Like, well, just fuck me, right?  Apparently, I have a uterus, so my brain stopped working.

On being thrifty: ""Ladies, fashion is cyclical!  Yeah, yeah, I know, right?  Hahaha, it will come back. I don't buy the new suits every time the fashion changes.  I wait a few months and buy it when they're on sale!"" So every season, he is still purchasing new clothes just because they're new.  That is his concept of the epitome of thrift.

""Your income increases.  Your spending increases.  You buy more stuff.  You live a better lifestyle.""  This is talking about first worlders already making 50-100k, mind you.  

Basically, he speaks as if the norm is always buying new new new new new upgrades and tossing the old, always buying based on emotional choices, and spending every cent of your free money.  I get that this is the segment of the population whom marketing can most affect, and thus we'd have the most interest in them, but he has never phrased it as that.  To him, EVERYONE just buys whatever a company shoves in front of their face.

What if, how about this.  What if my income increases from 60k to 70k, and I take that 10k and put it in savings instead of blowing it on shit I don't need?  

He has never once said anything to the effect that there is a point where people simply don't need anything else, that they may be happy with the old and want to keep it until it breaks irreparably, or that people would buy based on pure logic and not look at the commercials, or that people might find every company on earth pinging them on facebook to be annoying!  

And as bad as he is, the textbook is even worse.  ""Companies are your friend.  Companies want to please you.  Look at this pretty advertisement.  Now buy their junk. Good consumerist.""  "
4,Conspicuous Consumption,18,ayjbe8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anticonsumption/comments/ayjbe8/conspicuous_consumption/,4,1552001555.0,"Let me start out by saying something about minimalism; 

The secret to being a minimalist isn't HAVING less; it's WANTING less.

You can hate a practice or a mindset all you want, but forcing yourself (or others) to ACT a given way isn't going to change what really matters. If you want to be better about something, you need to change the way you THINK about it. So what does that have to do with conspicuous consumption? What IS conspicuous consumption?

Conspicuous consumption isn't going solo backpacking with a $300 stove. It's not wearing a $10,000 pearl necklace under your shirt, or keeping a $50,000 painting in your basement where only you see it. If no one else knows, it's not conspicuous.

It's not even driving a $60,000 car, or having a million dollar house. It might seem like these are conspicuous consumption; you're consuming way more than you need, and doing it in such a way that people will obviously know. But WHY are you doing it? Are you doing it because you want people to know how much money you have? If so, THEN it's conspicuous consumption.

NONE OF THIS EXCUSES OVERCONSUMPTION FOR OTHER REASONS! But it's also important to understand this thing if you want to fight it. WHY is CC (yes, I got tired of typing it out every time) a thing? Why should I care about you knowing that I have a fancy car or a lot of gold? Because humans are, by our very nature, competitive. We compete for resources, we compete for mates, and we do it for perfectly biologically valid reasons. A potential mate with more resources is preferable to an otherwise equivalent one with less; there's a better chance your offspring will do well. Having more resources yourself is a good thing; if I have many seasons of food stored up, my family and I can tolerate a year or two of bad harvests. It's perfectly natural, and in a sense perfectly valid, to not only want resources, but to advertise them; so long as you can protect your accumulated wealth, advertising it will help you attract a better mate.

So if it's so natural, even valid, what's the problem? The problem is that life isn't that simple, particularly as our population grows and the planet starts bursting at the seams. Simple self-interest is perfectly valid, interest in your family is perfectly valid, and they always will be. But even a child has a self interest. As they grow, they learn a regard for their family. It stands to reason that, as we grow, our circle of concern should continue to expand. 

It will never be most desirable to have less than anyone else; if that's what you're waiting for, good luck. So what could replace CC? Conspicuous responsibility, perhaps? A way of signalling that you have many resources, but that you handle them well? Charitable contributions are already often lauded. Small homes are, in some circles, becoming popular (if not the norm). Those are the sorts of things that will lead to a more balanced consumption that benefits us all, and to the more constructive use of wealth. Again, if you think you're ever going to change people to make them always prefer less to more, good luck. But we have a much better chance of making conspicuous consumption shameful, because of its wasteful nature, and replacing it with conspicuous responsibility (no, it's not a catchy name)."

1,Living in a van down by the river?,7,cjm7fo,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/cjm7fo/living_in_a_van_down_by_the_river/,5,1564458356.0,"Hi Reddit, I have a question for my fellow Americans. Lately, the subject of a Universal Basic Income has come up. My questions are these: 

If I owned an Astrovan, or any other type of vehicle large enough to have a bed, tv, solar panels, battery, etc in or on it, would tgere be any legal problems? Would I have to pay taxes if I didn't work, living off of that ""free"" govt money? Or heck, if my savings were sufficient, would I have to pay taxes at all? No property but my car and stuff within, no income, just self sufficient in a van down by the river.

Next, would I legally be able to park in the middle of nowhere and just live day to day, driving in to town occasionally to pick up the check (assuming a UBI is enacted) and buy supplies? 

I'm kinda yearning for a more simple detached from the world kind of life, and I'm just more or less wondering aloud if I could get away with it, with or without a UBI.

This is all hypothetical, obviously. But if anyone has already tried it for a while, I'd certainly love to hear their thoughts on the matter.

Tl;dr in the US, can you legally live in a vehicle - or I suppose a tent would work just as well - living a very minimalistic lifestyle, without worrying about the cops coming for you for tax evasion or something?"
2,"Mid thirties, single with 175k USD in cash, no house, no debt. My physician career too stressful. Do I just ""push on"" for 30 more yrs? Do I start over and retrain as software engineer (my childhood dream)? Could I (smartly) invest large chunk in crypto/stock to make money and do low paid job?",7,rjv7mp,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/rjv7mp/mid_thirties_single_with_175k_usd_in_cash_no/,16,1639914543.0,"Pretty much as the title says. I kind of grew up in a strict Christian cult - parents convinced me God's ""will"" for my life was medicine. In my small, conservative Christian world, disobeying God was unacceptable. At age 18, I abandoned my childhood dream to be a software engineer for a career in medicine instead. At that time I had self taught myself several coding languages and loved them.

Fast forward almost 20 years, I'm still in medicine.

About once a week I feel overwhelmingly stressed at work. Honestly most days I think my stress touches a 10/10 for at least part of the day. I'm a perfectionist and I don't give my patients half baked care. I cannot stand the thought of missing something and someone dying. I've been a successful physician for over 12 years but despite 3 recent job changes and a reduction in my working hours by 40% I still feel sick driving to work. Over the years I've delayed buying a house because I was worried I may have to take time off for a break and I couldn't afford the mortgage. So, here I am with $175k down payment, but struggling to see a future in this career. I don't know what decision to make about my future.

Some options I've thought of:

1. Returning to university and studying software engineering. Invest some of my 175k into re-education at 35. Is this really necessary though for me to be a successful and we'll paid software engineer?  It would be nice to have a similar salary ($150k p.a) to my current salary, but I don't know how realistic that would be. Maybe I'd need to take a large paycut if I retrain?

2. Stick out my stressful medicine job. There are definite advantages. It's 3 days a week and pays well for that part time work. I take vacations when I like. But the stress just kills the joy, I'm worried I will have a heart attack one day.
I feel too emotionally tired to socialise after work. I worry about my patients on my days off. I don't go out much outside work and I don't have many friends. I do miss that, but after talking to patients all day I have little care left for others after work. 

3. I'm presently living with a relative rent free. Do I take a huge risk and put a large chunk of savings into a well researched crypto/cheap stock and hope for the best? Athough, I really don't believe in miracles after escaping my stupis churchy upbringing I do wonder if I could strike it lucky.

4. Retrain in a different medical speciality with minimal patient contact. Pathology, Radiology, Research based stuff. It will be a long haul doing that though, looking at least another 5-10 years until fully retrained at a new specialist salary. I'm not sure I want to retrain elsewhere in medicine anyway. 

5. Get a very small manageable mortgage on a cheap regional home and find lower paid but less complex work such as a shop assistant, a gardener, shelving library books. Or trying to find cheap paid online freelance work I could do from home. I honestly have no idea what work that would be though.

I'm not saying these jobs don't have stress, but I feel like the gravity of a mistake would be much less than if I mistreat a patient. I feel like all my decisions daily are serious and I kind of am over that level of responsibility.

I have been through a lot of training and I think I have some useful skills. I prioritise and solve problems , I have good interpersonal skills and I'm used to stress. I somehow wonder if these skills could be used elsewhere. Ideally I'd like to do something online, even if it meant 25% or so pay cut. I just don't know what that job might be

We were pretty poor growing up, money and a big home honestly isn't very important to me. I'd rather live cheaply in a rural home and drive an old car so long as my life was relatively stress free and happy. I realise having a well paid job reduces financial stress - but it brings extra stress elsewhere. I don't like the feeling of stress that comes from knowing I could kill someone if I have a bad day at work.

I don't know if I can somehow find a comfortably paid middle of the road job with minimal stress and minimal additional training.

Any advice from the wise people of Reddit? Extra points if you've faxed a similar decision and would like to share your insight."
3,My inner monologue puts me down constantly. Is this kind of self-directed feedback normal?,6,go6wlb,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/go6wlb/my_inner_monologue_puts_me_down_constantly_is/,3,1590100431.0,"I have never liked myself. No matter what I say, no matter what I do, I see myself as a substandard human being, like there's something seriously wrong with my character. People often say that I'm a nice guy, that I'm kind-hearted and compassionate, that I put others before myself. Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one who really sees myself for what I truly am—an extremely manipulate, self-centered person who emotionally abuses others and does virtually nothing to contribute to the world in any meaningful way.

Let me just list out some of the things I think about myself:

* I display a blatant disregard for the personal boundaries of others—particularly women, who I feel I have a marked tendency to make uncomfortable. Basically, I slap myself with labels like ""incel"", ""neckbeard"", ""Nice Guy™"", ""creeper"", ""stalker""; I see myself as the embodiment of toxic masculinity in nerd culture, and I don't even call myself a nerd. I keep telling myself that I'm none of those things, that I respect women, but my inner monologue slaps me back down and says ""No you don't! You do *not* respect women! You treat women as objects! You act as though they owe you sex for being nice to them! You have a sense of entitlement over their time and attention and refuse to take 'no' for an answer!"" ""That's not true."" ""Yes it fucking is! Don't insult everyone else's intelligence by denying what is blatantly obvious to any idiot: you are a textbook Nice Guy™, and you use your so-called 'kindness' as a means of getting into their pants! Now stop arguing and *do something about it!*""

* I see myself as being self-centered and lacking in basic human empathy to the extent where it can actually be disturbing to see just how little regard I give to others. I don't consider myself to be a genuinely nice person. Being ""polite"", or saying emotionally supportive things, does not necessarily make someone nice. It's another example of how I am, at my core, a manipulative and emotionally abusive person.

* I have the emotional maturity of a teenager and am not ready—in fact, I might never be ""ready""—to handle serious commitments like a relationship or post-secondary education, no matter how badly I wish I could. I've never gotten behind the wheel of a car because I don't trust myself to be cautious while driving. I haven't had a real job in over six years, losing three over the course of three months. ""You can't even hold down a job, how do you expect to handle <this thing>"", says my inner monologue. ""You aren't really an adult."" I'm on disability for anxiety and depression.

* My character shortcomings are more noticeable, more numerous, and more serious than those of the average person, and *everyone* can see them.

Here are some of the ways that I perceive things, both online and off:

* On Reddit, I do not interpret downvotes as ""I disagree with your perspective"", nor are they ""well thanks, but that's not quite what I was looking for""; it's an expression of annoyance or frustration. It is in effect saying ""why are you wasting my time with your inane, tedious drivel?"" I take it very personally, as an indicator that I have responded in a socially unacceptable way. It's a sign that I'm annoying people.

* Responding to criticisms of my character with counterpoints feels like a dick move and a sign of arrogance. My inner monologue is like, ""You can keep arguing with everyone like a big baby 'til you're blue in the face, you can keep believing that everyone 'misunderstands' you—or, you can acknowledge that maybe YOU are the one that misunderstands, that your attitude is solely to blame for everything that goes wrong in your life, and start doing something about it like a God damn *gwown-up!*""

* In any situation where I receive a wide variety of feedback, I always take the harshest criticism offered as the most objectively accurate assessment of whatever it is I've said or done. Anyone who heaps praise onto me, or mitigates what I've done wrong as ""no big deal"" (or blames the other party more than me), doesn't know what they're talking about.

* I read articles about not being creepy as though they are written specifically for me, and that voice in my head says, ""This applies to you, whether you realize it or not, so read carefully.""

* When someone calls me out for doing something wrong or failing to follow the rules, I feel completely ashamed and embarrassed. I look at the people around me, and my inner monologue says things like, ""See those people? They don't need to be reminded to do <this thing>—why do you?"" ""I just made a mistake."" ""Yeah, well other people did not."" ""Okay."" ""Nobody should have to tell you to do <this thing>. That's basic human decency. You're 27 years old—start acting like it.""

* Any time people take my side on something, I always feel like *nobody* would be on my side if they knew the full story. That's why I will sometimes withhold any information that might be sympathetic to my point of view in the interests of what I consider a more honest assessment, without my manipulative tactics getting in the way.

* Every time I'm attracted to a woman and want to flirt with her, I shoot myself down before I even express how I feel: ""Just because she's nice to you doesn't mean she's interested."" ""Your conversations with her give every indication that the feelings you have for her are not reciprocated. Please don't make her uncomfortable by pursuing anything else. Just let it go."" ""***She does not like you in that way.*** Why is it so difficult for you to get that through your thick skull?"" I wish I could just experience love with someone without feeling like attempting to do so is presumptuous, or being constantly worried about making people uncomfortable.

* I feel like I need to let go of certain things, but my inner monologue tells me that I'm just going to experience the exact same problems no matter where I go or who I'm with, because *I'm* the one with the problem. I'm the abuser; I'm the toxic person; I'm at fault. And until I recognize that the buck stops with me, things will never get any better. In other words, I can't ""escape"" my problems. They will shadow me everywhere I go.

I know it's normal for people to have a negativity bias, but does everyone else have an inner monologue that berates them to *this* extent? Is this how regular people think? The voice inside my head constantly puts me down, greatly accentuates the negative, and leaves me feeling like I'm less than the average person, like there are things about my character that are flat-out unacceptable. The reason I want to know if this is normal is to be reassured that it's possible to live my life without having this specter hanging over my head."
4,"Why are some issues a problem with a car Manufacturer, and others just accepted as driver error, even if driver error is the main culprit?",2,jjlmpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/jjlmpy/why_are_some_issues_a_problem_with_a_car/,3,1603882772.0,"I'll admit, I came here after reading the article [Tesla's beta test of ""full self-driving"" system worries drivers, pedestrians — and even owners](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/autos/tesla-beta-testing-full-self-driving-system-worries-drivers-pedestrians-n1244787), but it has me wondering about why some things are just accepted as being the fault if a driver, and other things that are the fault of the driver, are pushed back against the Manufacturer.

This is not an anti Tesla rant, this is not a pro-Tesla rant, some other examples of driver faults that are being blamed on the Manufacturer include:

[MERCEDES-BENZ G-CLASS RECALLED OVER BRAKE ISSUE](https://practicalmotoring.com.au/car-news/mercedes-benz-g-class-recalled-over-brake-issue/) which was really only an issue if you drive the car aggressively over corrugations and rough terrain, I've read that recall notice, it was all cars, however the issue was only identified in cars that are driven in poor conditions and driven poorly in those conditions.

[Toyota addresses DPF debacle](https://www.carsales.com.au/editorial/details/toyota-addresses-dpf-debacle-124604) which interestingly affected mainly people that did lots of short trips, and fleet owners and people who drive long distances and tow seemingly have a lot less issues, which leads me to believe people weren't doing what the book says about maintaining a DPF and giving the car a good run a couple times a week.

Yet other things that are clearly accepted as driver error include:

Drink Driving

Speeding believing cruise control will always maintain the correct speed

Following too closely believing that auto braking will stop you

Driving recklessly in the rain believing traction and or stability control will handle conditions for you

To me anyway, a lot of ""issues"" with cars these days are drivers not focusing, or operating, their cars appropriately, and then this is pushed back on the Manufacturer as a fault with the vehicle, despite the possibility that the customer was operating the vehicle outside of the Manufacturer recommended operating procedures.

For example, back to Tesla, its stated often, and repeatedly in the car, manuals, and media that drivers must remain attentive when using the self driving functions and be ready to take over, however Tesla always cops blame when there's an incident, even if it's then shown that the driver was not paying enough attention to the operation of their vehicle.

So why do Manufacturers cop flack for owners not doing the right thing?"
5,Am i in the wrong in this situation and Is it bad to “show up your boss”? LONG,1,ery21l,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/ery21l/am_i_in_the_wrong_in_this_situation_and_is_it_bad/,6,1579628243.0," Sidenote I am using voice to text so that I can text faster as it is really long and I am at work so I’m sorry if something is not exactly clear just ask me because I got new acrylic nails and it’s very difficult to type.

BACKGROUND: i work security for a company, who sends out employees to clients, in this instance i am working in an 18 floor building, that has a loading dock and a 9 floor parking garage that need to be secured and maintained for a large oil and gas company. The site is currently not only under partial construction but some fuckups with the old supervisor have made the client and the clients client (the building owner and the tenant company) not like us. And we have been told by out district manager to “avoid giving out any information to the tenant companies security” as they have their own cyber security who could “make us look bad” Im with three coworkers, who are as follows.


Dock guard: sit at a desk dock and “look” intimidating and write down any vendors who come in (food deliveries for the in house cafe)


Console: sit at a desk next to a receptionist and be a literal monkey. People go the the (tenant) receptionist (2ft Away at the same table, i dont even know why SHE herself cant just. Give the passes out since she is checking the credentials anyway) and get their credentials checked, then go to the security officer who does nothing but give them a card and write their name down. Literally a task that could be done by a monkey. This guard also looks at emails, and cameras and during my shift is done by the new (as of a week) supervisor of the site.


Garage guard; a new guard that started TODAY the client said they wanted another patroll out in the garage. You sit outside and either drive a go cart or report parking related issues ie wrong floor parking or car damage etc. 


Roamer; me, i walk around (all 18 stories) and scan certain checkpoints give other guards their brakes and make sure there’s no suspicious people I also patrolled the parking garage since the girl who is currently doing it is not parking garage certified i’m also basically the Lego mule for Consol dock in garage guard in case they need to do anything something needs to be grabbed or some person needs to be escorted on or off property or to a certain room etc.


THE PROBLEM;


As stated The garage guard started today not just the guard but the entire shift has been chosen into existence just today so obviously no one knew what it would be doing except for the clients who requested it to be there. So anyone with common sense would ask the tenant or the client what exactly they want that post to do, would they not? 


So since the guard herself was new I trained her on how to do things around and what the client wants already while I was doing that I assumed the supervisor who does literally fucking nothing anyway on his post other than be a badge monkey would ask the important questions and find out what we need to know by the time I get back from my 30 minute long jog around this 18 story godforsaken building. The tenant was right there next to him on the computer that he usually uses to check cameras and emails so he obviously was not doing anything other than being a badge monkey in which case he had more than enough time to ask these fucking questions and what happened when I got back and I asked him hey what is the garage guard post supposed to do what did he say? “I DONT KNOW YOUD HAVE TO ASK *Cyber security leader for tenant* “ Who was - May I add - 2 1/2 feet away from him for the past 30 fucking minutes so I said OK and began asking her the questions that needed to be asked for the post I then also confirmed with her what her phone number was in the work phone because apparently we didn’t have it in the work phone even though she said that she has given us like five different business cards that had all of her numbers on it to which I said “ oh i’m so sorry I will make sure that this gets done right away” . As I didn’t put it in the phone right there in front of her, to which she said “ well I’m finally glad that this is getting done” to which I did not reply my (only been here a week) supervisor is right next to me the entire time. 


So I begin to ask her all of the questions That I needed in order to train the new guard and then re-iterating what she said to make sure that I have down exactly what they want me to do because that’s just what I do and then when I go to put her business card away I found all 50 of her fucking business cards in our drawer that our supervisor has been sitting next to for the past week. So I said “oh well here is some of your business cards back that way you can give them to other people to help the environment and not have to print anymore for a little bit”


She laughed and as I was walking away the supervisor mouthed to me “ Watch it watch what you say to her”


To which I’m sitting here thinking OK but if you have been looking at all of those for the past week and a half they know you’re a new supervisor and they specifically requested the old supervisor to leave because he sucked so badly it wouldn’t make you look bad it would only make the previous supervisor look worse right? And if you’re worried about looking bad or not why did you not ask this woman the questions that your employees needed when you had the 45 minutes alone with her to fucking ask her and then give it to me no I had to ask her my damn self because I am not about to go out to a post with my thumb up my ass not knowing what everyone wants when there’s cameras everywhere and that would make me look bad. I have bills to pay I don’t give a fuck Who you are, what your position is,  or how scary you look, if I need to know something and you have the answer I will ask you because I am doing honest fucking work and I am not about to waste my time the clients time the tenants time and make my company look worse because I go outside to a post not knowing what the fuck to do only to be later I asked Wil why didn’t you ask these questions before going out to the post?


Also just to add I trained the doctor guard to work yesterday because he started yesterday today I trained the garage guard on all of the new including the still relevant old procedures (after asking all the questions I needed because how the fuck can you train someone if you don’t know how the fuck to do a job yourself) because she started today and why the supervisor could not train them I don’t know but I would love to be the supervisor of this site because apparently my district manager cannot get or find a supervisor that is competent.


TLDR apparently I made my supervisor look bad in front of a client because I asked them questions on how to do my job when he did not ask them because I was being asked to do side job at that moment and when I asked him what I’m supposed to do he said “ I don’t know” directly in front of the client after he had about 45 minutes alone with them to ask the very same questions. Minutes that he wasted his time not doing anything and the client watched that happen... 


so he made himself look bad and now he’s mad at me"

2,I dont understand the whole 'what decision does the car have to make' dilemma,99,hkikno,https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfDrivingCars/comments/hkikno/i_dont_understand_the_whole_what_decision_does/,55,1593780985.0,"You've probably seen it, there is a setup, usually a crosswalk, and the car is going to have to choose between killing a baby, two doctors or a grandmother or whatever.

I understand the appeal of putting that in your tv show. It's got fancy words like 'self learning AI' and you can fill airtime with the moral discussions. Everyone can have an opinion and feel invested. But it doesnt make any sense from a technical standpoint.

Lets take the most basic setup. Something unexpected has shown and the car is going to have to choose between going straight and swerving.

Surely the catch all solution would be to stay in your lane and brake? It's a computer. It's way better at quick reactions than humans. It's got the shortest braking time. And it has access to things like the airbags, so even if it has to suddenly slam on the brakes while going 200 km/h, it can employ stuff to protect it's passengers.

Why would there be time to swerve if there isnt time to brake?

On a highway, the most likely thing that can unexpectedly show up is another car suddenly going out of it's lane. If all the cars respond to that by wildly swerving, then they also go out of their lane, force others to swerve and it's just one big mess.

Compare to just braking hard. This passes the problem on to the car behind you. But that self driving car has been keeping a safe distance. It's also very good at braking quickly. So is the car behind that one. Sure, traffic would slow down, but it usually does that anyway if something unexpected happens on the highway.

The argument they often bring up in shows or youtube vids or whatever is that the car will have to choose between protecting it's passenger and the guy who suddenly stepped out into traffic. But that's bollocks. Their setup is contrived and just an excuse to talk about moral dilemma's. If it's a legal crossing at say an intersection, the car should have detected that there was a red light coming up and adjusted it's speed. If it's not a legal crossing, he made his choice. Brake hard and if there isnt time to brake in time, that's too bad. But at no point ever in that scenario is the passenger of the car in danger. Inconvienced, sure. Traumatised, maybe. But not harmed. Are they gonna replace all the crumple zones and safety cage stuff with wet cardboard? It's a car. If it hits a dude, that dude is fcked. The guy in the car is safe. 

If the car was late in detecting the moose or the pedestrian crossing or the truck jackknifing all over the highway, why is everyone confident it's analysis of what lane is safe to swerve into is correct? Things like traffic in the other lanes, possibly even in opposing directions are never mentioned in this moral dilemma stuff. Neither is the option of swerving onto the sidewalk. 

Detecting stuff in front and very short braking times and distances are some of self driving cars their strongest points. It's also the best direction to have an accident in, usually. Swerving might lead to getting Tboned for example. Or head on collisions instead of rearending. Yes, there's a few situations where swerving is better, but those are rare, and should get even rarer with drivers replaced with self driving cars. A suicidal wrong way driver for example. That's a 'omg swerve' situation. But for the vast majority of events, staying in lane and braking is the best option for a self driving car."

a small part of the story. Waymo has the most mature technology. They started earlier and have the most confidence in their software, and have driven the most miles, they also have teams doing simulations, in the real and virtual worlds. 

However, to commercialize their product it takes something besides the most mature tech. That magic is infrastructure. Waymo has customer service centers set-up to deal with issues in the field. They have to write software to link those centers to the cars and customers apps. They have programs to work with local police and fire to train them how to deal with the cars. They have offices and people on the ground in the launch cities to deal with issues that come up. They have a mapping team that has mapped several cities and is ready to start on new ones with procedures and people in place. They have government affairs people to deal with local governments, smooth things over and lobby. They have PR response teams to deal with accidents and the press. They have deals to work with the rental car companies to maintain and clean their cars. They have Realestate in multiple cities to store and manage fleets and house offices. 

This is what commercialization looks like. No other company is near commercialization.  If your self driving start up doesn't have 500-1000 people working for it, it's not near commercialization. If you have 10 people your purpose is to be acquired. 

It's waymo and Cruise, and Cruise is only a player because GM can deliver lots of infrastructure. "

0,Full report on first drive in FSD Beta 10.11.1,74,tpqxva,https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfDrivingCars/comments/tpqxva/full_report_on_first_drive_in_fsd_beta_10111/,47,1648408627.0,"**Car:** 2020 Model 3 Performance

**Location:** Bay Area, Ca

I got the 2022.4.5.20 update last night, so I used FSD Beta to make a coffee run this morning. I chose a location about 3 miles away (roughly 9 minutes with traffic, signals, etc.). All suburban driving (not a downtown urban area like SF or SJ). No freeways.

The drive there ended up being especially instructive, highlighting many of what I consider Tesla's weaknesses. Four total interventions, two of which were motivated by safety concerns, the other two of which were to prevent annoying/inconveniencing other drivers.

**Home to Starbucks:**

* **First intervention, straight out of the gate (lol):** The car attempted to drive *straight* into the opposing curb when pulling out of my building. It was a comically clumsy way to start my maiden 10.11.1 drive. It was supposed to turn left and didn't even appear to be veering slightly when I hit the brakes. (I worry this kinda thing may impact my Robotaxi side income!)
* Whatever. I made the turn for the car, re-engaged, and things were uneventful for the next mile or two. Turns remain disconcertingly jagged, but other than that it was fine.
* **Visualizations:** The new visualization is a step in the right direction, even if it's just superficial. FSD Beta has always looked painfully inaccurate when it comes to precise awareness of curbs (which obviously matters, especially for tight turns around dividers), and I'm not sure the underlying vector space is much better than it was before, but the display overlays sharper vector lane markers now and looks less messy and amateurish than the last version I used.
* **Concern (but no intervention):** The next noteworthy moment came when I noticed a crumpled (but not flat) cardboard box in the middle of my lane. I have no reason to believe FSD Beta even knew it was there; nothing appeared on the visualization, and other than a few pre-defined exceptions (like orange cones), the system doesn't appear to be aware of things on such a fine-grained level. And sure enough, the car plowed right over it. It was safe in this case, but what if this wasn't cardboard? What if it some sheet metal had fallen off a truck (or whatever), landing in a heap of the same size/appearance? I worry Tesla lives in a cartoon universe in which a handful of objects are all that exists—cars, people, dogs, trash cans, and orange cones—leaving the system vulnerable to a wide range of small but dangerous obstacles it doesn't have a pre-trained awareness of. (I've had similar issues in previous FSD drives with fallen tree branches and chunks of concrete that had been knocked off the curb, neither of which the system recognized.)
* **Second intervention:** Next, a fellow driver waved me forward at a four-way stop. I'm honestly not sure why; she might have needed another minute before proceeding herself, but it doesn't really matter; the car clearly didn't pick up on this, nor would it have any way of signaling back even if it did. Since the car was just sitting there, I felt compelled to intervene and proceed manually. Not safety critical in this case, but an example of *exactly* the kind of subtle challenge that Elon and his team never seem to even imagine hypothetical solutions for.
* **No phantom braking!** *Halle-fucking-lujuah!* This is the **first** FSD Beta drive I can remember in which the car didn't come to at least one sudden stop in the middle of the road for absolutely no reason. Phantom braking is the reason I've stopped using FSD Beta at all in fact, apart from giving each new version one test drive when the roads are mostly clear. So, progress, I guess?

**Starbucks to Home:**

* I manually drove the car a few miles away from the Starbucks to introduce some novelty into the return trip.
* **Speed limit questions:** A long 35 mph zone temporarily switched to 25 mph. The car didn't seem to notice this, either on the visualization or in its behavior, but I did notice it was a 25 mph sign that said either ""during school hours"" or ""when children present"" (I can't remember which, exactly). This is a fairly standard caveat on speed limit signs in residential areas, and adds to my ongoing concern of how any self-driving system will deal with signs that require parsing an English sentence and behaving conditionally based on surrounding circumstances. Even if the car had been trained in advance for this precise sign (of which I've seen many, many variations, btw), is it really behaving differently based on what it sees? Can it determine when the quantity and stature of pedestrians constitutes ""children present""? How exactly is such awareness being validated, and what's the failure rate? A lot of questions on this topic. (Another issue I worry may cut into my cross-country robotaxi side income.)
* **Final two interventions:** Both occured within a mile of my place and were of a similar nature. The first was while merging into a right turn lane, when an SUV in front of me was getting so close that I worried we were going to bump fenders if I didn't intervene. Like all interventions, it's not always clear what would have happened if I let the car sort things out, but it was **way** too close for comfort, and even without a collision, already constituted dangerous driving. The second was in a left turn lane, in which, for no reason, the car slowed down so much while approaching the turn that I worried it was going to run out the green arrow altogether and \[rightfully\] infuriate the driver behind me.

**Bottom line:**

**I see no reason to believe this particular software will ever come close to L5.** It's not a question of ""getting better"" or ""the march of 9's"". This isn't a difference of degree, but one of kind. By all accounts, this software remains **fundamentally**:

1. Limited and unreliable in terms of basic, object-level perception. The objects it does recognize (including curbs) are extremely imprecise in terms of contours, movement, etc., while other, smaller classes of objects don't appear to register at all (road debris, etc.)
2. Incapable of the kind of reasoning a human driver deploys on a regular basis (see my examples above about a driver waving me past a stop, estimating the rigidity and weight (e.g. the danger) of debris in the road, or making sense of signs depending on natural language instructions and varying conditions (""when children are present"").
3. Inexplicably tied to rapidly aging hardware, which only exacerbates a problem I already consider intractable.

I have no doubt truly self-driving cars will arrive, maybe in a decade or so—I'm not the type who thinks our brains are somehow ""uncomputable""—but FSD Beta seems about as likely to get there as a 1990's Nokia is to morph into an iPhone. *Some* technology will cross the finish line, but I'd happily bet quite a bit that it won't be *this* technology."

However, even a car this advanced may occasionally run into some weird situation where it can't decide what the best course of action is. 

I was thinking that given the degree of network connectivity it may be cheaper for the car companies to employ a pool of professional drivers who can remote in and control the car if it ever gets in a situation where the computer can't make a choice. I think this would be cheaper than trying to program the computer to react to every possible obscure situation, though it does come with it's own difficulties, like hacking vulnerabilities, trust issues and bandwidth requirements.

What are your thoughts on this? Will we ever reach the point where a human is never required to be in the loop? Will remote operation ever play a role in self driving car technology? Will people trust a remote operator to take control of their vehicle?"
3,Self-Driving Tips,2,mmbf0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfDrivingCars/comments/mmbf0v/selfdriving_tips/,0,1617827955.0,"The Self-Driving Bible

My name is Noah and I’ve created this guide in hopes of helping the open source community in self driving. I’ve worked in the industry and have come across many instances where I think we as a whole can make a difference. So let’s begin. I  have experience working in helping shape self driving tech in big corporations. With that being said, I am ready to expose and share my insight on a few things even if it means…. End of Context for now. 

The Neural Network

1. Think of this as a baby. A baby will not know from good or bad unless you teach it. For instance the more “bad” data you teach it the more it can realize that hey this is bad and a “NO-NO”. If you teach it “good” data over time the network will understand more good data and realize this is the data that is crucial for my system. 
2. There will be discrepancies and errors, dependent on the quality of our data.
3. Theoretically the more batches of “data” then we have more examples of how to teach the network. We have to classify whether “data” is good or bad depending on the scene of what we are working on or the layer we are focusing on whether it be traffic lights, stop signs, etc.. 
4. Think of teaching the network rules of  the road from the DMV handbook, but also how we “humans” drive as well. How do we teach a car to “learn” to drive safely at all times? 

Stop Signs.

1. Stop Sign: Red, Octogonal shape, 
2. In terms of object detection, when a camera sees this shape it needs to “visualize” several key components. The text “STOP” is important. If we make guidelines such as these 1.) Stop text has to have STO meaning at least three letters and pass through the red color and octagonal shape then we will have more “GOOD” data compared to 2.) Stop text having only partial letters like ST like two letters and that's it. 
3. Blurriness matters and if text is blurry then we will have more discrepancies in the batch of data in our neural network. It is ideal to have more accurate data than data that is hurried and quickly pushed out to meet certain deadlines and efficiency. 
4. Stop signs have poles!!! So in your graphical system you need to make sure that you attach the “stop sign” to a pole relative to the ground. Sometimes the ground isn’t visible due to the scene or there are bushes and you can’t see the actual ground. In those cases it is better to guess appropriately relative to where an actual pole is. 
5. The Network will have errors, for example if a VAN has a Stop sign behind its bumper as is a sticker how can the “Network” learn that hey this Stop sign doesn’t matter to me. It’s fake. So we have to distinguish from several key components such as entering a drive thru or fake “Stop” Signs.
6. Different countries have different Stop Sign Text like “Alto” in Mexico. Be aware of this. 
7. Ever evolving Stop Sign layer w be efficient depending on how you teach the network.   

8. Sometimes in front there will be two stop signs make sure that you teach the car how to follow safe rules of the road. 

&#x200B;

Markings in Ground

1. Marking such as arrows turning to the left or right have to follow several key rules. The markings have to be clear and the arrow tip has to have at least three reasonable points to 1.) Be a Marking 2.) To see the direction of said marking
2. L\_TurningArrow, R\_TurningArrow, F\_Arrow,  

3. The more marking examples you have that are efficient the quality will boost in your data batch.
4. Sometimes Cars will be blocking arrows so this means you shouldn’t “TAG” or object detect yet until the network has more data to understand that hey this is actually a marking in the ground. 
5. Sometimes markings will be hidden, obstructed by light or cars or things.Take note of this. 

Lanes/Intersection lines

1. Now Lanes are important and how do we tackle lane lines? If you’re a 3D modeller you’ve come across an orthopedic top view. Let’s suppose you are looking in a top view of an intersection. 
2. Since we are only focusing on lane lines we need to be aware that hey my car is about to enter an intersection so take note of this and label that the line is dotted, dashed, double dashed accordingly and the directions.
3. If it's a solid white line tag this is. If it’s a passing lane tag it . If there's a bike lane to the right or a golf cart lane tag it. If there is a solid barrier to the left tag it. Such as a barrier diving two lanes.
4. How do we know there is a barrier in between??Where there is concrete and light making a fake lane line depending on **shadow**. You have to keep in mind all this. 
5. In a top view there may be trees blocking the lane lines now what? Should we make an estimated guess as to where the lane line follows the path?
6. This is where we need to create something to help us. By superimposing we can make a 3D Tunnel to really see what is going on. 
7. Sometimes your car can be underneath a tunnel now what? How will I see the lane lines? 
8. What about parking lanes? Tag these 

Parking Lines

1. When you think of parking think of it as a box containing parking information inside. 📷 

2.) You will come across handicap zones or parking lines that are faded so now what? Should I guess these parking lines? Yes or No? Is it safe to do so?

RailRoad Arms 

1. When an Arm is closed it means it's “activated” when the arm is open it’s “deactivated. Though it's also important to see the “traffic lights” are they on? Is there a train track  in front of you or signage that indicates.

Speed Zones/Signage/Pedestrians

1. Just like stop signs there is a pole present and does it meet my criteria of a speed sign. White background, rectangular shape, etc. 
2. Blurry text? Indication that the sign is truly real by what's around us. 
3. How do we know you are a real human? Do we stop before a stop line? Do we Stop in a yellow pedestrian lane or unit lights are activated? What if you suddenly walk in front of my car? Keep asking yourself these questions and this will improve your data. 

Computer Vision

1. All of these things are layers of “semantics” or guidelines/rules of what we teach a car in order for it to behave well. Consisting of 3D videos with a timeline that are perhaps 1-2 min. Then you could see a different perspective Top Aerial view, Side View, 3D world View, Only seeing pure “LINES” think of it as a 3D modelling program when all of this information works in tangent with your other 2D program. BAM!! You got yourself a simple self driving car. 
2. Various cameras side of my car panels hidden, front and back, all working to provide “eyes” for me to see and my computer system is quick to react and process large amounts of data in real time. 

Pre-Made Maps

1. Maybe relying purely on computer vision is not your cup of tea and you want to make simulated maps and then update them accordingly. It is possible. 

Combination of Both? 

1. How would a combination of both look like? 

How is data even collected? 

1. Hello Mcflyyy anyone home? GOOGLE MAPS. Google maps is great and its free to use right?? Anyways can you theoretically use google maps to have a top side view of things? Why is Musk so interested in satellite technology? Do you see all these WAYMO cars driving around your neighborhood and in the streets, but why?
2. Tesla Cars you don't think are a fleet and capturing a ton of data by their “FLEET” and what's funny is that the consumer is even “BETA” testing new features and these tech giants then use this feedback to improve the system and charge even higher prices lmao. Corporate greed anyone?? I bet you even Tesla utilizes Google Maps to label certain areas…… 
3. ZOOX cars, Waymo cars hell even those copycats in NURO. FYI Nuro is a joke and they're literally copying TESLA tech lol. 
4. Amazon Prime, Fed Ex. Lyft, Uber, its only a matter of time 

Transparency

1. Why is self driving tech bad? Well ethics of course do we see videos of drivers being hurt or pedestrians being hurt? No
2. Is our privacy kept safe? Perhaps but you don't have access to your car taking images in your garage lol. Doubtful.
3. Why is safety so important to these big corporations because we don't want to see people dying of course or the big car regulators in the US impose rules and regulations for our technology to be halted. 
4. What about hackers or people who will find vulnerabilities within the system? Perhaps they already have  
5. Are taggers labelling batches of data everyday in corporations such a Tesla, ZOOX, etc. Do they get any recognition or are they simply used ? 
6. ETHICS, ETHICS, AND MORE ETHICS!!! 
7. Who will pay if I'm in an accident? Is there a black box of information as to what happened? 
8. Look at what TOYOTA and MIT/stanford  are doing to help research drifting and enable safer car maneuvers."

3,Tempe crash was Uber's fault. Period.,57,86dlhf,https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfDrivingCars/comments/86dlhf/tempe_crash_was_ubers_fault_period/,71,1521741705.0,"Autonomous cars would possibly be the most relevant example where we should talk about ethics around responsibility of computer engineers. This is software(and hardware) running the world with possible life changing consequences for the involved.

After the recent Uber self driving car crash, a lot of questions have been raised on who owns the responsibility for the incident. A video for the crash has been released which has shown that possibly the crash was unavoidable also along with some statements by the local police.

I highly disagree with the entire analysis of this incident. This has only been viewed by all media from a human perspective where it definitely seemed impossible to prevent the accident if a human was driving the car.
The major flaw in that argument is that the car wasn’t driving like a human. Any self driving car would take a lot of inputs from the environment apart from simple camera feeds. After all, why would we build autonomous cars if they couldn’t take better actions than humans?

Why I believe it’s Uber’s fault?
Any profession’s ethics dictate that the designer owns the responsibility for the event.
An engineer who designed a plane owns the responsibility of it crashing, although due to any environmental conditions. A car company owns responsibility of safety of a passenger in a crash.

What should Uber do?
I believe that Uber should come forward and take responsibility for the event irrespective of what the law determines. The police authorities are simply ill-equipped to take a decision on a matter like this.
Uber should publish all the data that was gathered by the car during the accident, and allow the scientific community to voice their opinions of whether the accident was in fact impossible to be detected. This sounds counter-productive for a business, but a real big step for currently nascent autonomous driving technology.

What if it was indeed impossible to be detected? As responsible engineers, we would need to start over again and find out what went wrong. A technology operating at this level can simply be not be allowed to have failures.

Last but not the least, let me point out this article by Bill Sourour which helped me reflect about how ethics is an important but often ignored topic in software engineering.

5,"In the 1800, ""Red Flag Laws"" set rules for self-driving carriages",45,bty71q,https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfDrivingCars/comments/bty71q/in_the_1800_red_flag_laws_set_rules_for/,25,1559037794.0,"For example, in the UK, there [was a law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_flag_traffic_laws) that required self-propelled vehicles to have a footman carrying a lantern or red flag (hence the name) walking in front of the vehicle as a warning to riders on horses, pedestrians, and such.  

Fast forward to now, and all these laws are gone and, in fact, new laws are passed that ban horses on roads, etc.

What are the modern day  self-driving car equivalent of these red flag laws?

Which also makes me wonder, how long until human driven cars are banned on certain roads?"

Here's news that won't get unanimous support from owners of vehicles that include driver-assistance systems enabling the cars to carry out certain maneuvers by themselves.

The Utah Senate, following the local House of Representatives, has passed [a law penalizing drivers ](https://le.utah.gov/~2022/bills/hbillint/HB0137.pdf)who are arrested for driving under the influence even with the systems activated. 

Under the bill, a driver who activates the self-driving feature while under the influence violates the law. They can be cited for DUI because someone still has to be in charge of the vehicle while the systems are activated.

The bill now goes back to the state House and then to the desk of Gov. Spencer Cox for his signature or veto.

The bill, sponsored by state Rep. Steve Eliason and state Sen. Curtis Bramble, is designed to clarify existing law following an individual's line of defense in a DUI case. 

The lawmakers took care to clearly explain what they meant by an automatic driving system. Essentially, any feature, no matter how advanced, is considered an automated driving function."

[Congress Just Signed ""The Four-Wheeled Patriot Act""](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-09-08/congress-just-signed-four-wheeled-patriot-act), Zerohedge 9/8/2017

Leading argument from the article is, ""Whenever Congress does something unanimously (or nearly so) *you can rest assured it’s in their interests, not ours.* ... This is the law that exempts *automated* cars from the safety requirements that apply to *autonomous* cars – that is, the cars which are independent of government control and controlled by us.""

Article is in regard to the ""Safely Ensuring Lives Future Deployment and Research in Vehicle Evolution Act"", or '[SELF DRIVE Act](https://energycommerce.house.gov/selfdrive/)'. Went looking for additional coverage from Ars Technica, Techdirt, similar sources but could not locate anything. News articles I've been able to locate don't go into depth of analysis I'd hope for. 

Skimming through seeing if I can find source documents and better assess the sensationalism in the article.

Edit: Actual bill (headed for Senate) is here, [SELF DRIVE Act, H.R. 3388](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3388/text)

Skimming through commenting on things of note.

* Takes away rights from States to pass regulations regarding design, construction, or performance of automated vehicles

* Cybersecurity of automated driving systems restricts manufacturers from selling products unless meeting certain standards. Item 3) is ""A process for limiting access to the self driving system"". This strikes me as providing the backing of federal regulatory power to limit the ability of product owners to work on their purchases equipment (see farmers struggle with John Deere, using copyright and locking down system in a way to make farmers dependent on service agreements. At what point do you no longer 'own' but only allowed to 'rent'?). Other end is that locking down access only makes the products less secure by barring independent security researchers from being able to audit the code, rip it apart and find security flaws that must be fixed. This system must be open to scrutiny or critical failings will exist causing harm far longer than necessary. Look to groups frequently finding creative flaws in vehicle automation systems to unlock. If there's a flaw, it will be found. Speed up that process.

* Requires rear seat occupant alert system. Anyone know the intent here? Is this an existing requirement in vehicles on the market? Assuming possibly related to air bags in the rear seats of the vehicle. 

* Requires manufacturer develop a privacy plan available to the customer. Looks like offloading the burden of thought onto the creativity of the manufacturer to load everything into Terms of Service, signing away every right in return to use the product. The standard Facebook model of Terms and Conditions. Posted actual language below for review. Obligatory recommended viewing for the documentary ""[Terms and Conditions May Apply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzDgBITDaRY)"".

> (1) A written privacy plan with respect to the collection, use, sharing, and storage of information about vehicle owners or occupants collected by a highly automated vehicle, vehicle that performs partial driving automation, or automated driving system. Such policy shall include the following:

> (A) The practices of the manufacturer with respect to the way that information about vehicle owners or occupants is collected, used, shared, or stored.

> (B) The practices of the manufacturer with respect to the choices offered to vehicle owners or occupants regarding the collection, use, sharing, and storage of such information.

> (C) The practices of the manufacturer with respect to the data minimization, de-identification, and retention of information about vehicle owners or occupants.

> (D) The practices of the manufacturer with respect to extending its privacy plan to the entities it shares such information with.

* ""(4) If information about an occupant is anonymized or encrypted the manufacturer is not required to include the process or practices regarding that information in the privacy policy."" - So if a company uses the weakest forms of encryption, or are lazy about anonymizing data ""there, I deleted the names column! anonymized!"", there is no requirement to inform the public how this process is taking place. That will lead to information collected neither anonymized or secure.

* Federal Trade Commission to provid enforcement of violations of the privacy policies.

Returning to the Zerohedge article, it builds out from the argument that automated vehicles are a means to limit a publics freedom of movement by a government. Imagine a revolutionary force trying to operate in a country without vehicles under independent control, if the means of transportation can be immediately turned off by the government in power that fight ends quickly. On the less radical considerations we have the ongoing domestic spying program that has wrapped itself around western societies. There is a discomfort with this idea in that once that control has been mandated, how does one erode it and return to independent freedoms?

At the core here what stands out to me is the big issue not getting enough attention - who owns data? What rights do individuals have to the data generated by their works or activities? Many of the abuses and mind numbingly stupid headlines we see today (see Equifax) are simplified by observing a publics **Right-to-Data**. **1) The individual gets final say regarding how their data is used, and shared, requiring explicit sign-off for those uses. 2) The individual holds the right to retract authorization for use of that data generated by them at any time.** These are modern privacy rights that really need to be fought over and amended into the US Constitution to observe the inherent rights of man in a modern age. Without this many of those already enshrined have been undermined and weakened, contorted into pretzels no longer recognizable.

So who do we trust? Zerohedge has a point in the current environment there is no shortage of examples of US government pushing bills saying ""no, just trust us. we left these parts vague and there are concerns but we'll shore that up and add detail later."" then lawyers are employed to maximize the size of the trailer that can by driven through those massive holes in the language. 

Automated driving is an incredible technology to bring to the world, but there needs to be careful thought and be wary of these systems becoming mandated. Now is the time to be wary and guard against autonomous driving becoming somehow ""illegal"" or infrastructure non-existent.

**TL;DR - This is a complex issue with significant pitfalls, bill is silent on many of these. In a time when political parties pull no punches trying to tear one another to pieces it's downright weird to get a unanimous vote on an issue. Who's getting screwed?**"
9,What happens to society when there are no more jobs?,5,2uzsrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2uzsrf/what_happens_to_society_when_there_are_no_more/,24,1423238331.0,"Alright r/technology, I'm just curious about some thoughts you all have since this is something I occasionally ponder...while drinking scotch...

What happens when machines/computers have taken over all job related tasks and there is no such thing anymore as a ""job""?  I mean, there are learning robots that can effectively replace almost any factory worker at this point.  There are writing bots that write news articles.  Self driving cars exist and could replace taxis is laws would catch up.  Music writing bots have existed for a while now producing classical music.  IBM Watson destroys at Jeopardy while helping develop new drugs.  And the diversity of function which bots have is greatly expanding year by year.

Indeed, with full deployment of current tech some analyses suggest >40% of the current workforce would be out of jobs (in America at least, not sure with other countries but I presume similar for Europe and the Asia-11).  

So, let's say another hundred...or 500 years go by and ever job that is currently in existence is now done by a ""bot"" of some sort.  How does society function?  Is it utopian like in Childhood's End or dystopian like in District 9?  What do people do with their lives? Do whole new industries pop up that people work in and if so, what industries are those?"
